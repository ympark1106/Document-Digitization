 FOREWORD
 This 2016 edition of the Louisiana Standard Specifications for Roads
 and Bridges is hereby approved for use on construction contracts awarded
 by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development and other
 governing bodies. These standard specifications are subject to amendment
 whenever necessary by supplemental specifications or by special provisions
 applicable to specific contracts.
 A new subsection numbering system is introduced based on a decimal
 format. This specifications book also uses the active voice, imperative mood
 when describing the contractor’s responsibility.
 Numerous changes have been made from the previous edition of the
 standard specifications. Many parts of the specifications including the
 general provisions, asphalt pavements, portland cement concrete, structures,
 and materials have been reorganized and/or significantly rewritten. Users of
 previous versions of these standard specifications are advised that this has
 resulted in the movement of some topics from their previous locations to
 more appropriate locations in the new specifications or perhaps their entire
 deletion if no longer considered necessary by the Department.
 Use of these standard specifications by any organization or individual
 will be at the user’s risk. Organizations or individuals citing these standard
 specifications by reference in their contract work will be responsible for
 furnishing prospective bidders copies of the specifications along with any
 amendments that may affect their contract.

 General Information, Definitions, and Terms
 101.01 VOICE/MOOD AND REFERENCES. This specification book
 uses the active voice, imperative mood when describing the contractor’s
 responsibility. For example:
 101.01.1 Active Voice/Imperative Mood: Provide competent
 supervision.
 The subject of a sentence written in the active voice/imperative mood is
 not explicitly stated. In these specifications, the implied subject of such a
 sentence is typically the contractor, although in certain situations, the
 subject may also be a vendor, fabricator, or manufacturer engaged by the
 contractor to supply material, products, or equipment for use on the project.
 Prior to award of a contract, the imperative statements are directed to the
 bidder; it is only after the contract has been awarded that the imperatives
 are directed to the contractor.
 Section and Subsection titles, and headings provide reference only, not
 interpretation.
 A cross-reference to a specific Subsection of these specifications
 includes all general requirements of the Section of which the Subsection is
 a part.
 Unless specified by year or date, cited publications refer to the most
 recent issue, including interim publications, in effect on the first date of
 advertisement for bids.

 sureties providers on the Bidx.com site.
 
 24
 
 102.10 DELIVERY OF BIDS. Unless delivered electronically through
 the approved electronic bid submission service, each bid should be
 submitted in the envelope furnished by the Department, if issued. The
 blank spaces on the envelope shall be filled in correctly to clearly indicate
 its content. When an envelope other than the one furnished by the
 Department is used, it shall be the same general size and shape and be
 similarly marked to indicate its contents, including, if required, the
 contractor’s Louisiana contracting license number. Bids and bid bonds
 shall be received no later than the time and at the place specified in the
 Notice to Contractors. Paper bids and bid bonds received after the time set
 for opening bids will be returned to bidders unopened. Electronic bids
 shall be submitted via the Internet in accordance with 102.07. Electronic
 bids transmitted by the bidder after the time set for bid opening will not be
 accepted.
 102.11 WITHDRAWAL OR REVISION OF BIDS. For paper bids, a
 bidder may withdraw or revise a bid after it has been deposited with the
 Department, provided the request for such withdrawal or revision is
 received by the Department’s issuing office in person, in writing, or by
 email, before the time set for opening bids and at the location set forth in
 the Notice to Contractors. Electronic bids submitted to Bid Express may
 be withdrawn prior to the specified bid opening time by the authorized
 bidder.
 102.12 PUBLIC OPENING OF BIDS. Paper or electronic bids will be
 publicly opened and read or presented at the time and place indicated in the
 Notice to Contractors.
 102.13 WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS DUE TO ERROR.
 102.13.1 Withdrawal of Bid: The Department may allow a bidder to
 withdraw a bid after the scheduled time of bid opening in accordance with
 LRS 48:255, if a bid contains patently obvious mechanical, clerical, or
 mathematical errors and if clear and convincing sworn, written evidence of
 such errors is furnished to the Department within seventy-two hours of the
 bid opening, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or other legal holidays. If the
 Department determines that the error is a patently obvious mechanical,
 clerical, or mathematical error, it shall accept the withdrawal request and
 return the bid security to the contractor. If the bid withdrawn is the lowest
 bid, the next lowest bid may be accepted.
 25
 
 Submission of a bid withdrawal request shall constitute bidder’s
 agreement to suspend the tolling of time for award of the contract during
 the pendency of the request. The award deadline will be extended by the
 number of days, rounded up to the nearest whole day, from the submission
 of a bid withdrawal request until the Deartment’s determination regarding
 said request.
 102.13.2 Other Bid Protests: The Department may also allow a
 bidder to protest any matter regarding the bidding or award of a contract
 after the scheduled time of bid opening.
 The protest of a bidder must be submitted in writing and, specifically set
 forth the grounds and/or reasons for the protest. The written protest must
 be delivered to the DOTD Chief Engineer within 72 hours after notice of
 bid rejection, irregularity or any other action regarding the bidding of the
 contract, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.
 102.13.3 Hearing by the DOTD Chief Engineer - Prior to
 Contract: If a bidder files a notice of error along with a request to
 withdraw the bid, or protests in a timely manner any other matter regarding
 the bidding or award of the contract, the DOTD Chief Engineer, or
 designee, will hold a hearing within a reasonable period of time after a
 request has been delivered. The DOTD Chief Engineer will give the
 requesting bidder reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing.
 The bidder may appear at the hearing and present evidence together with
 other facts and arguments in support of the request, except, for a request to
 withdraw a bid for reason of error, the bidder making such request will be
 limited to the sworn written evidence submitted within the time period
 prescribed in this subsection.
 102.13.4 Proposal / Bid Guaranty: When notice of a bid mistake
 and a request to withdraw the bid is made, the proposal/bid guaranty shall
 continue in full force and effect until and unless there is a determination by
 the Secretary that the conditions of 102.13.1 have been met. If the
 Secretary determines that an error occurred in the preparation of the bid in
 compliance with the statutory and contractual requirements, the
 Department will return the proposal/bid guaranty to the bidder.
 102.13.5 Bid Withdrawal Consequences:
 If it has been
 determined that an error has been made and the bidder is allowed to
 withdraw a bid, the individual, partnership, corporation, or any other legal
 entity or joint venture submitting the bid will not be allowed to resubmit a
 bid on the project, perform work on the project as a subcontractor or subsubcontractor, or to supply any material or labor to the entity to whom the
 contract is ultimately awarded.
 26
 
 If all bids are rejected after a bid is successfully withdrawn, the
 withdrawn bidder shall not be eligible to bid on the project unless the readvertisement and opening of bids for the work is at least one hundred
 eighty days after the date the bid is withdrawn.
 
 27
 
 Section 103
 Award and Execution of Contract
 103.01 CONSIDERATION OF BIDS. After paper or electronic bids

 prior to award.
 4. A determination of the Department or the funding agency not to
 build the proposed project within twelve months of the letting date.
 5. The disqualification or rejection by the Department of all bidders.
 6. The discovery, by the Department prior to award, that an error,
 28

 process or may have led to a potential advantage or disadvantage to one or
 more of the bidders.
 103.02 AWARD OF CONTRACT. The Department shall award the
 contract to the lowest responsible bidder within 45 calendar days after the
 receipt of bids or within 20 days after the receipt by the Department of
 concurrence in award from all funding agencies or sources, whichever

 receipt of bids to award of contract, shall not exceed 60 calendar days
 unless extended by mutual agreement between the Department and the
 successful low bidder. Should the successful low bidder not agree to extend
 the deadline for award of contract, the proposal/bid guaranty may be
 returned to the bidder and the Department, at its discretion, may award the
 contract to the next lowest bidder or may readvertise the project.
 An enforceable contract is not created until it is fully executed by all
 parties.
 103.03 CANCELLATION OF AWARD. The Department reserves the
 right to cancel the award of contract at any time before execution of said
 contract by all parties without liability against the Department for any of
 the following reasons:

 later than sixty days after receipt of bids. The Department will destroy the
 bid bonds of unsuccessful bidders not later than sixty days after receipt of
 bids. Electronic bid bonds of unsuccessful bidders will not be returned but
 29
 
 will be deemed by the Department to have no force or effect after sixty

 be properly executed and returned to the Department within 15 calendar
 days after transmission to the bidder. If the contract is not executed by the
 Department within 20 calendar days following receipt of all required
 documents, the bidder shall have the right to withdraw his bid without
 penalty.
 30
 
 103.07 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT. Failure by the bidder
 to comply with 103.06 will be cause for cancellation of the award and
 forfeiture of the proposal/bid guarantee, which shall become the property
 of the Department, not as a penalty, but in liquidation of damages
 sustained. For those projects wherein a proposal/bid guarantee was not
 provided with the bid, failure to comply with 103.06 will be cause for
 cancellation of the award and bidder to be disqualified from bidding or
 subcontracting for a period of one year from the award date. Awards,
 which were cancelled, may then be made to the next lowest responsible
 bidder or the work may be readvertised for bids, at the Department's
 discretion.
 Should a proposal/bid guaranty be required to be forfeited by the bidder
 to the Department or other named obligee, and if for any reason the full
 amount of the proposal/bid guaranty is not collected or collectable by the
 Department upon demand, the bidder will be disqualified from bidding or
 subcontracting for a period of one year from the date of non-payment.
 103.08 NOTICE TO PROCEED. The Department will issue the
 contractor a Notice to Proceed or a Conditional Notice to Proceed as soon
 as possible after award of the contract, and in no case will issue the
 contractor a Notice to Proceed or a Conditional Notice to Proceed later than
 60 days after contract execution unless written consent of the contractor
 has first been obtained. If the Department has not issued the contractor a
 Notice to Proceed or a Conditional Notice to Proceed within 60 days of
 contract execution, and written consent of the contractor to extend this time
 period has not been obtained prior to its expiration, the contractor may
 demand cancellation of the contract.
 After award of the contract, the project engineer will schedule a
 preconstruction conference. The preconstruction conference will be held
 prior to performing any work on the project, preferably during the
 assembly period, but not later than the first day of field operations. The
 project engineer will schedule the conference sufficiently in advance to
 permit the attendance of all parties concerned. The contractor is urged to
 have all subcontractors and major suppliers in attendance at the
 preconstruction conference.
 
 31
 
 Section 104
 Scope of Work
 104.01 INTENT OF CONTRACT. The intent of the contract is to
 provide for performance and completion of the described project. The
 contractor is obligated to complete the project in accordance with the
 contract documents.
 The Scope of Work consists of, but is not limited to, the following:
 i) all Work necessary to perform, construct, and complete the items
 described by the Contract, which may include extra work;
 ii) all Work made necessary by an increase in the quantity of a major or
 minor pay item;
 iii) all other Work incidental and necessary to perform, construct, and
 complete the Work specifically referenced or described by the Contract and
 necessary for delivery of a completed Project conforming to the Contract
 and suitable for its intended purpose;
 iv) the performance of any testing as directed by the engineer to
 determine if any work or any finished product complies with the Contract,
 and;
 v) except as provided in 105.03, to correct and/or replace deficient or
 nonconforming work, materials, or finished product at no additional cost or
 expense to the Department with work, materials, or finished product that
 does conform to the Contract.
 To that end, the contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment,
 tools, transportation, and supplies required to complete the work in
 accordance with best industry practices and the Contract, with the Contract
 taking precedence over industry practices. Performance methods and
 sequences are described in the contract documents when considered
 necessary for the successful completion of the project.
 When an item in the contract contains a choice to be made by the
 contractor, the contractor shall indicate the choice to the engineer in
 writing.
 When the project specifications reference or require the use of
 “manufacturer's recommendations or specifications”, the contractor shall
 provide the engineer with a current copy of these recommendations or
 specifications.
 The contractor acknowledges, and expressly agrees, that this public
 works project is based on estimates of anticipated work; that changes in the
 32
 
 work, item quantities, planned work sequences, or methodology can be
 expected; that the contract does not guarantee any bid profit margin, any
 bid overhead recovery, or scope of work; and that payment, in accordance
 with 109.02, will be made only for fully completed work that is accepted,
 and for the materials incorporated therein.
 As work on the Project progresses and in accordance with Section
 109.05, the Department shall make partial payments of the Contract Price,
 as adjusted in accordance with the Contract. The Department shall adjust
 the Contract Amount as necessary to compensate the Contractor reasonably
 and fairly for any extra work ordered by the Engineer.
 Subject to the Contractor’s right to bring legal action against the
 Department, the Contractor shall deliver the project to the Department
 within the contract time as adjusted in accordance with the Contract.
 104.02 ALTERATION OF THE CONTRACT.
 The Department
 reserves the right to order such alterations in quantities and plans, within
 the general scope of the contract, including alterations in grade and
 alignment, as deemed necessary or desirable in order to complete the work
 as contemplated. Pay items affected by such alterations shall be performed
 in accordance with the project specifications and payment will be made at
 the same unit prices as other parts of the work, except as provided in
 109.03 and 109.04.
 The Department reserves the right to order work not provided for in the
 contract whenever such extra work is found essential or desirable to
 satisfactory completion of the contract within its intended scope. Such
 extra work shall be performed in accordance with specifications and as
 directed. Payment for such extra work will be made as provided in 109.04.
 The Department reserves the right to order changes in details, including
 changes in materials, processes and sequences, whenever such changes are
 in the best interests of the public or are necessary or desirable to
 satisfactory completion of the work. Such changes in details shall be
 performed in accordance with the specifications and as directed, and
 payment will be made as provided in 109.04. Changes ordered in details,
 when such changes are allowed or required by the contract, are not
 alterations to the contract and payment for the affected work will be made
 at the contract unit prices.
 An approved change order will be executed by the Department and the
 contractor to alter the contract in accordance with these and other similar
 provisions of the contract when any alteration is more than incidental, as
 determined by the Department, to other work specified in the contract. The
 33
 
 change order will describe the nature and scope of the contract alteration
 and the increase or decrease in the contract amount or time. Upon approval
 by the parties in Site Manager, or other Department approved contract
 management software, a change order is fully executed and a binding
 amendment to the contract. Additionally, the parties agree to thereafter
 execute a paper duplicate of the change order.
 The adjustment in Contract Amount and/or Contract Time stated in a
 change order shall comprise the total price and/or time adjustment due or
 owed the contractor for the work or changes defined in the change order.
 In the event the contractor refuses to execute a disputed change order,
 the Department reserves the right to execute a change order without the
 contractor’s assent in order to document the contract alteration and adjust
 the contract amount and/or time accordingly.
 Alterations to the contract as provided for by this subsection shall not
 invalidate the contract nor release the surety, and the contractor agrees to
 accept the work as altered, as if it had been part of the original contract.
 The contractor shall notify the surety of any alterations to the contract.
 Alterations of the contract shall not involve work beyond the termini of the
 proposed work except as necessary to satisfactorily complete the project.
 Contractor will be allowed to begin the work upon verbal approval of a
 change order, when such is given by the appropriate authority for each
 category of change order. Verbal approval shall be followed up in a written
 format via email, facsimile, or letter within seven days of given verbal
 direction.
 Force Account records, in accordance with 109.04, shall be
 maintained until a fully executed Change Order is completed, and then
 used to document incurred costs pursuant to LRS 48:252. In the event of a
 disputed change order, Contractor shall record and maintain records of all
 costs associated with any work alteration.
 104.02.1 Differing Site Conditions:
 1. During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent physical
 conditions are encountered at the site that differ materially from those
 indicated in the contract, the party discovering such conditions shall
 immediately notify the other party in writing of the specific differing
 conditions before they are disturbed any further and before additional work
 is performed.
 2. Upon written notification, the engineer will investigate the
 conditions and if he determines that the conditions do materially differ and
 will cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the
 performance of any work under the contract, an adjustment, excluding loss
 of anticipated profits, will be made and the contract modified in writing
 34
 
 accordingly. The engineer will notify the contractor of his determination
 whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.
 3. No contract adjustment, which results in a benefit to the contractor,
 will be allowed unless the contractor has provided the required written
 notice.
 104.02.2 Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer:
 1. If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or
 delayed by the engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not
 originally anticipated, customary or inherent to the construction industry)
 and the contractor believes that additional compensation and/or contract
 time is due as a result of such suspension or delay, the contractor shall
 submit to the engineer in writing a request for adjustment within 7 calendar
 days of receipt of the notice to resume work. The request shall set forth the
 reasons and support for such adjustment.
 2. Upon receipt, the engineer will evaluate the contractor's request. If
 the engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for the performance
 of the contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the
 suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the
 fault of the contractor, its suppliers, or subcontractors, and not caused by
 weather, the engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and
 modify the contract in writing accordingly. The engineer will notify the
 contractor of his determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract
 is warranted.
 3. No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the contractor has
 submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed.
 4. No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the
 extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any
 other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded under
 any other term or condition of this contract.
 104.02.3 Significant Changes in the Character of Work:
 1. The engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time
 during the work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in the
 work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes
 in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the
 surety, and the contractor agrees to perform the work as altered.
 2. If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the
 character of the work under the contract, whether or not changed by any
 such different quantities or alterations, an adjustment, excluding loss of
 anticipated profits, will be made to the contract. The basis for the
 adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a
 35
 
 basis cannot be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or
 against the contractor in such amount as the engineer may determine to be
 fair and equitable.
 3. If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change
 the character of the work to be performed under the contract, the altered
 work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the contract.
 4. The term “significant change” shall be construed to apply only to
 the following circumstances.
 a. When the character of the work as altered differs materially in
 kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed
 construction or;
 b. When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the
 contract, is increased, or decreased, in excess of 25 percent (25%) of the
 contract quantity as awarded. Any adjustment in unit price will be made on
 only that portion of the major item exceeding the 25 percent (25%)
 increase, or, in the case of a decrease of the item by 25 percent (25%) or
 more, the remaining portion will be adjusted.
 104.02.4 Eliminated Items: Should any items or portion(s) thereof
 contained in the contract, whether bid as a unit price or as a lump sum, be
 found unnecessary for proper completion of the work, the engineer may,
 upon written order to the contractor, eliminate such items from the contract
 and deduct their total price from the contract amount through a change
 order. Such action shall not invalidate the contract.
 When a portion of an item is eliminated or its quantity reduced, a
 deduction for the eliminated work will be made in the contract amount for
 that item as determined by the engineer. No allowance, except as provided
 herein, will be made for any increased expense, loss of expected
 reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits claimed by the contractor
 resulting either directly from such elimination or indirectly from
 unbalanced allocation among the pay items of overhead expense by the
 contractor and the subsequent loss of expected reimbursements therefor, or
 for other reasons. When an item or portion thereof is eliminated, the
 contractor will be reimbursed for previously authorized work done toward
 completion of the item.
 The change order authorizing reimbursements shall show how the
 reimbursements were derived. Except when otherwise authorized by the
 Chief Engineer, such derivation shall show breakdowns of costs as detailed
 in 109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.7.
 104.02.5 Extra Work: When necessary or desirable to complete the
 project, the engineer may direct the contractor to perform unforeseen work
 36
 
 for which there is no pay item or unit price in the contract by issuing, when
 appropriate, a Notice of Extra Work to the contractor. The Department will
 pay for such work as provided below through an approved change order.
 Upon receipt of a directive or written Notice of Extra Work, the
 contractor agrees to perform the work as directed and provide the Engineer
 a written cost estimate in accordance with 109.04.
 If the Engineer rejects the cost estimate provided by the contractor, the
 Department may:
 1. Issue a directive requiring the contractor to proceed with the
 Extra Work and to document its costs in accordance with the provisions of
 109.04.3; or
 2. Advertise the Extra Work for bid in accordance with LRS Title
 48.
 104.03 MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC. The contractor shall provide
 for and maintain through and local traffic at all times and shall conduct his
 operations in such manner as to cause the least possible interference with
 traffic at junctions with roads, streets and driveways in accordance with
 Section 402, unless otherwise noted in plans or special provisions.
 The contractor shall keep the portion of the project being used by public
 traffic, whether through or local traffic, in such condition that traffic
 (including mail delivery) will be adequately accommodated. The contractor
 shall furnish, erect and maintain barricades, warning signs and delineators,
 and shall provide flaggers and pilot cars in accordance with the plans and
 the MUTCD. The contractor shall maintain existing drainage and also
 provide and maintain in a safe condition all temporary approaches or
 crossings, intersections with roads, streets, businesses, parking lots,
 residences, garages and farms, at no direct pay.
 When the engineer directs additional measures for the benefit of the
 traveling public, payment to the contractor will be made at the contract unit
 prices in the contract or as provided in 109.04. The engineer will be the
 judge of work to be classed as additional measures.
 All lane closures, including ramps, shall be authorized by the engineer.
 Unless otherwise authorized, lane closures will only be allowed while work
 is being performed. The contractor shall provide the engineer a five
 calendar day notice, prior to any lane closure unless a shorter notification
 period is allowed by the engineer. A late lane opening rental will be
 charged to the contractor for any lane closure on any roadway or ramp that
 extends beyond the allowed closure times. The rental shall be computed in
 hourly increments only, with fractions of an hour rounded up to the next
 37
 
 whole hour. The rental will also apply to any unauthorized lane closures
 by the contractor, whether short term or long term. Any rental monies
 assessed for a late lane opening or for an unauthorized lane closure will be
 deducted from payments due the contractor. The late lane opening rental or
 unauthorized lane closure rental will be in accordance with Table 104-1 for
 a maximum of four continuous hours per instance.

 104.04 FINAL CLEANING UP. Before final acceptance, the
 right-of-way, borrow and local material sources, and areas occupied by the
 contractor in connection with the work shall be cleaned of rubbish, excess
 materials, temporary structures, haul roads and equipment. All parts of the
 work, including property adjacent to the right-of-way, which have been
 damaged or rendered unsightly during the work shall be left in satisfactory
 condition and when required, the right-of-way shall be mowed in
 accordance with DOTD maintenance standards, all at no direct pay.
 104.05 GUARANTEE AND WARRANTY OF CONTRACTOR’S
 WORK. By signing the contract the contractor guarantees and gives full
 warranty (1) of the quality of materials incorporated into the work, (2) that
 all work will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, (3) that the
 finished product will be fit for its intended use and purpose and constructed
 in conformity with the Contract, and (4) that the contractor’s work will be
 otherwise free of all defects.
 For the purpose of this subsection, defect shall be understood to mean
 and to include all conditions or characteristics of the contractor’s work not
 in conformity with the project plans and specifications including, without
 limitation, any nonconformity with the project plans and specifications that
 (1) renders the contractor’s work inconsistent with applicable design
 standards, (2) that the contractor has not declared prior to Final
 38
 
 Acceptance, or (3) that the Department has not observed or detected in the
 course of Final Inspection. Defect shall be understood to exclude
 reasonably anticipated depreciation or deterioration of the contractor’s
 work and all other conditions arising exclusively from the intended use of
 the finished product and not caused by a defect as defined in this
 paragraph.
 At no direct pay and in accordance with the instruction of the engineer,
 the contractor shall remediate or replace any work which the Department
 determines to be defective during the guarantee and warranty term.
 If it should be found that portions of the Project failed due to defective
 material or faulty workmanship and if such defective portions cause any
 breakdown or accident, the contractor will not only be required to furnish
 and install the replacement portion, but will also be held responsible to the
 Department for all expenses due to accident or breakdown caused by such a
 failure, including the repair or replacement of any other portion damaged
 by the failed portion, and/or the replacement of any other portion or
 equipment when such replacement is necessitated by the replacement of the
 portion which is the subject of the warranty.
 The term of this guarantee and warranty is 3 years after final
 acceptance, except for National Highway System (NHS) projects. For NHS
 projects, the guarantee period and warranty term will be 1 year from final
 acceptance of the project.
 This guarantee does not include an obligation by the contractor, or the
 department, to maintain the contractor’s work during the guarantee and/or
 warranty period, or otherwise.
 104.05.1 Equipment, Instruction Sheets: For the purpose of this
 subsection, equipment shall be understood to mean and to include all
 equipment, project component, apparatus, and/or all parts of such
 equipment (1) purchased or acquired by the contractor subject to an express
 warranty provided by the manufacturer of the equipment, and (2) installed
 by the contractor in accordance with project plans and specifications.
 Instruction sheets that are required to be furnished by the manufacturer
 for installed project equipment, apparatus, materials, supplies, and
 operation shall be delivered by the contractor to the engineer prior to final
 acceptance of the project, with the following written warranties and
 guarantees:
 1. Unless otherwise specified, the manufacturer's standard warranty for
 each piece of installed project equipment, project component, or apparatus
 furnished under the contract.
 2. The contractor's guarantee that, during the guarantee period,
 39
 
 necessary repair or replacement of the warranted equipment, project
 component, or apparatus will be made by the contractor at no direct pay.
 3. The contractor's guarantee for satisfactory operation of installed
 project equipment including, but not limited to, the mechanical and
 electrical systems furnished and constructed under the contract for the
 guarantee period.
 To extent possible, contractor shall acquire all such warranties in the
 name of and for the benefit of contractor and the Department. Otherwise,
 Contractor shall assign and subrogate all of contractor’s rights under all
 express warranties of such equipment or project components, or parts of
 thereof, to the Department and deliver such to the Department before
 acceptance of the work.
 The term of the warranty or guarantee period shall commence upon the
 final acceptance date of the project. If it should be found that parts or
 portions of equipment failed due to defective material or faulty
 workmanship and if such parts should, within the manufacturer's warranty
 period, cause any breakdown or accident, the contractor, during the term of
 its guarantee period, will not only be required to furnish and install the
 replacement part, but will also be held responsible to the Department for all
 expenses due to accident or breakdown caused by such a failure, including
 the repair or replacement of any other equipment damaged by the failed
 equipment, and/or the replacement of any other equipment when such
 replacement is necessitated by the replacement of the equipment or part
 which is the subject of the warranty.
 The contractor shall insert one copy of all warranties and guarantees
 into the maintenance manuals specified. Routine maintenance during the
 guarantee period will be performed by the Department.

 Section 105
 Control of Work
 105.01 AUTHORITY OF THE ENGINEER. The engineer, acting
 directly or through duly authorized representatives in accordance with
 105.09, will decide all questions which arise as to quality and acceptability
 of materials furnished and work performed, rate of progress of the work,
 interpretation of plans and specifications, and acceptable fulfillment of the
 contract by the contractor.
 The engineer will have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in
 part due to failure of the contractor to correct conditions unsafe for
 workmen or the general public; for failure to carry out provisions of the
 contract; for failure to carry out orders; for such periods as deemed
 necessary due to unsuitable weather; for conditions considered unsuitable
 for prosecution of the work; or for other conditions or reasons deemed to
 be in the public interest.
 Orders to suspend the work will be in writing and will include the
 reasons for the suspension. The order to resume work will also be in
 writing.
 The Chief Engineer has the authority to suspend the work if, at any time,
 the required policies of insurance become unsatisfactory to the Department,
 as to form or substance, or if a company that has issued any policies
 becomes unsatisfactory to the Department.
 When work is suspended due to acts, failures to act, or omissions of
 the contractor, all delays resulting therefrom shall be non-excusable delays
 and noncompensable.
 105.02 PLANS AND SUBMITTALS. Conform to 801.05.2 for format
 of plans, and submittals.
 Maintain a copy of all plans and submittals at the job site throughout the
 duration of the contract.
 105.02.1 Plans: The contractor will be furnished, without charge, a
 maximum of five sets of half-scale plans, unless full-scale plans are
 requested. Plans will show lines, grades, typical cross sections, location
 and details of structures, and a summary of pay items. Only general
 features will be shown for steel bridges.
 Standard plans required for the work, but included only by reference,
 41
 
 will be furnished free of charge to the contractor upon request.
 105.02.2 Submittals: A submittal consists of a transmittal letter and
 required submittal contents. The transmittal letter shall include the state
 project number, project name, route, parish, transmittal date, and the
 submitter’s name and address. Unless otherwise specified, transmit
 submittals to the Project Engineer for review or record as provided below.
 Copy the Project Engineer on all submittals transmitted to other specified
 recipients.
 Submittal contents include working drawings and documents necessary
 to adequately control the work and fulfill contract requirements. The cost
 of producing, transmitting, and revising submittals shall be included in and
 incidental to their respective pay items.
 A submittal shall show clearly and explicitly that its objective complies
 with the contract documents and applicable codes. Vague, imprecise, or
 ambiguous submittals will be returned for re-submission. The Department
 may return the submittal for correction or additional information. Failure
 to explicitly identify in submittals contract and/or code deviations may
 result in rejection and replacement of subsequent work at no cost to the
 Department.
 Submittals do not alter, modify, or revise contract documents. The
 acceptance by the engineer of submittals will be subject to satisfactory
 installation and execution of its objective. Submittal acceptance will not
 relieve the contractor of responsibility under the contract for successful
 completion of the work or responsibility for compliance with the terms and
 conditions of the contract.
 Submittals shall be made in accordance with the following, unless
 specified elsewhere.
 105.02.2.1 Submittal Processes: Submittals will either be for
 record or review.
 105.02.2.1.1 Submittal for Record:
 The Department
 reserves the right to comment on submittals for record, but otherwise work
 may proceed on corresponding work once the submittal is received by the
 engineer.
 105.02.2.1.2 Submittal for Review: Do not fabricate, install
 or purchase an item, or perform corresponding work prior to receiving
 submittal acceptance and any specified document distribution is complete.
 Submittal for review will be stamped either “Returned for Correction”
 or “Accepted in accordance with LSSRB 105.02,” initialed and dated by
 the reviewer, and returned to the contractor by the Project Engineer.
 42
 
 a) Returned for Correction: A submittal stamped “Returned
 for Correction” has been rejected by the Department due to nonconformance with the contract, proposed unequal item substitution,
 perceived installation conflicts, missing information, or other deficiency.
 b) Acceptance:
 A submittal stamped “Accepted in
 accordance with LSSRB 105.02” indicates that, at the time of review, the
 Department has not identified a reason to reject the submittal.
 105.02.2.1.3 Review Periods: For bidding purposes, unless
 specified otherwise, allow a minimum of 14 calendar days per submittal or
 resubmittal. Review periods for separate submittals are not concurrent.
 Portions of a submittal marked “Returned for Correction” will receive
 a new review period upon re-submittal.
 Submittal review for manufactured items will not begin until all
 interdependent items have been submitted except as described herein.
 Submittals for mechanical, electrical, or facility items that must be
 ordered early due to long delivery time may, with the approval of the
 Project Engineer, be submitted for review without associated assembly or
 working drawings, or other items that are interdependent with the long lead
 time item. Assembly or working drawings that contain long lead time
 items, and other submittals for interdependent items shall still be prepared
 and submitted for review in a timely manner.
 105.03 CONFORMITY WITH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
 105.03.1 Conformity Obligation: All work and materials shall
 conform to the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions, material and all
 other requirements of the contract.
 By signing the Contract, the contractor expressly affirms its
 understanding of the requirements of the contract, and agrees that it shall
 be obligated to complete the project in accordance with those requirements.
 105.03.2 Reasonably Acceptable Work: When the engineer
 finds the materials furnished, work performed, or the finished product not
 in compliance with the contract but that reasonably acceptable work has
 been produced, the engineer will determine to what extent the work will be
 accepted and remain in place. If accepted, the engineer will document the
 basis of acceptance by change order and/or special agreement. The change
 order and/or special agreement will contain appropriate documentation for
 an adjustment in the contract price for the work, materials, associated costs,
 or value of the deficient work as necessary to support the engineer's
 determination. Reduced pay schedules will be used when such schedules
 are a part of the project specifications.
 43
 
 105.03.3 Nonconforming Work: If the engineer finds the
 materials, work performed, or the finished product not in compliance with
 the contract and have resulted in an unsatisfactory or unacceptable product,
 the work or materials shall be removed and replaced at no direct pay.
 When directed, the Contractor shall preserve the removed work or
 materials at the project site, at no direct pay, pending disposal directions
 from the engineer. Other corrective actions submitted by the contractor
 will be considered by the engineer and if accepted, will be performed by
 the contractor at no direct pay.
 If due to the contractor's negligence or selected method of operation in
 performing the work, the engineer deems it necessary to make changes, the
 contractor will be liable for the additional cost to the Department,
 including, but not limited to, the cost of consulting engineers or inspectors.
 The amount thus determined will be deducted from payments for the work.
 The contractor and its surety shall be solidarily liable for any expense
 incurred by the Department pursuant to this provision in excess of any
 remaining amounts due the contractor under the contract.
 105.04 COORDINATION AND PRECEDENCE OF CONTRACT
 DOCUMENTS. These specifications, the supplemental specifications, the
 plans, special provisions and supplementary documents are essential parts
 of the contract. A requirement occurring in one is as binding as though
 occurring in all. They are intended to be complementary and to describe
 and provide for a complete work.
 In case of discrepancy, the following order of precedence will apply:
 1. Special Provisions
 2. Plans
 3. Supplemental Specifications
 4. Standard Specifications
 5. Standard Plans
 Calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions.
 The contractor shall take no advantage of any error or omission in the
 plans or project specifications. If the contractor discovers such an error or
 omission, he shall immediately notify the engineer. The engineer will then
 make such corrections and interpretations as deemed necessary to fulfill the
 intent of the plans and project specifications.
 105.05 COOPERATION BY CONTRACTOR. The contractor shall
 keep one complete set of plans and other contract documents available at
 the work site.
 44
 
 The contractor shall give the work the constant attention necessary to
 facilitate the progress thereof, and shall cooperate with the engineer,
 inspectors, and other contractors.
 The contractor shall have on the work site at all times, as the
 contractor's agent, a competent representative capable of reading and
 understanding the plans and project specifications and experienced in the
 type of work being performed, who shall receive and execute directions
 from the engineer. At the preconstruction conference or upon request, the
 contractor shall furnish the engineer written notice of the name and
 telephone numbers of the representative. The representative shall have
 authority to execute orders or directions of the engineer without delay and
 to promptly supply such materials, equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals
 as required. The representative shall be furnished regardless of the amount
 of work sublet.
 The contractor shall furnish the Department the authorized signature list
 with the names of persons authorized to sign for him in matters pertaining
 to change orders, force account or extra work, contract time charges and
 other documents. No work shall commence on the project until the
 contractor has complied with this requirement. A revised authorized
 signature list shall also be furnished when a person so designated is
 removed and replaced.
 105.06 COOPERATION WITH UTILITIES. The Department will
 notify all known utility companies, pipeline owners or other parties
 affected by the work and endeavor to have the necessary adjustments of
 public or private utility fixtures, pipelines and other appurtenances within
 or adjacent to the limits of construction made as soon as possible.
 Upon award of the contract, utility companies affected will be advised
 by the Department of the name and address of the contractor, approximate
 date work will begin, and other pertinent information.
 Except as hereinafter provided, and regardless of whether the utility is
 shown on the plans or referred to in the project specifications, all water
 lines, gas lines, wire lines, fiber optic cables, telephone lines, cable
 television lines, service connections, water and gas valve boxes, light
 standards, cableways, signals, and other utility appurtenances within
 construction limits which prevent completion of the contractor's work will
 be relocated or adjusted by the owners at no expense to the contractor. The
 contract will indicate utility items to be relocated, adjusted or constructed
 by the contractor.
 Where a utility crosses or otherwise occupies an area within
 45
 
 construction limits of the project and the utility will not have the
 Department's required clearance when the work is completed, it shall be the
 Department's responsibility to arrange for necessary relocation to the
 required clearance. When the required clearance will exist when the work
 is completed, but relocation is considered necessary by the contractor for
 construction purposes, the contractor shall make arrangements with the
 owner for any relocation or adjustment necessary to the operations at no
 direct pay. In such cases, upon completion of the work and prior to final
 acceptance, the final location of the utility will be acceptable to the
 Department. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to mean that the
 Department waives its rights to control entrance onto, or location on, its
 right-of-way of any utility or appurtenance.
 When the engineer determines that the contractor is experiencing
 significant delays in the controlling items of work because of delays by
 others in removing, relocating or adjusting utility appurtenances, contract
 time extensions shall be considered for such delays in accordance with
 108.07. On the date stipulated in the Notice to Proceed, the contractor shall
 begin work in connection with fencing, clearing, grubbing, removal of
 structures and obstructions, and relocation and demolishing of other
 structures, provide layout as needed, and shall prosecute such work to
 completion to avoid delays in removal or adjustment of utilities. The
 contractor shall cooperate with the utility companies to avoid delays in
 completion of work.
 When the contractor's work involves excavating or underground
 demolition activity, the contractor is required to reach Louisiana One Call,
 prior to starting any work, in order to comply with the Louisiana
 Underground Utilities and Facilities Damage Prevention Law.
 105.07 COOPERATION BETWEEN CONTRACTORS. The
 Department reserves the right to contract for and perform additional work
 on or near the work covered by the contract.
 When separate contracts are let within, adjoining, or adjacent to the
 limits of the project, each contractor shall conduct the work not to hinder
 the progress of work by other contractors and shall cooperate with each
 other as directed by the engineer. When a contract is let within, adjoining,
 or adjacent to the limits of existing project(s), the existing project(s)
 schedule of work takes precedence over the subsequent project.
 The contractor shall arrange the work and shall place and dispose of
 materials being used not to interfere with the operation of other contractors
 within, adjoining, or adjacent to the limits of the project. The contractor
 46
 
 shall acceptably join the work with that of other contractors and shall
 perform the work in proper sequence to that of the others and without
 causing disruption or delay to the schedule of project completion.
 The contractor shall assume all liability, financial or otherwise, in
 connection with the contract and shall hold the Department harmless and
 indemnify the Department from all damages or claims that may arise
 because of inconvenience, delay, or loss experienced by the contractor or
 caused to other contractors due to the presence and operations of other
 contractors working within, adjoining or adjacent to the limits of the
 projects.
 105.08 CONSTRUCTION STAKES, LINES AND GRADES. The
 contractor shall set construction stakes establishing lines and continuous
 profile grade in road work, and centerline and bench marks for bridge
 work, culvert work, protective and accessory structures and appurtenances.
 The engineer will furnish the contractor all necessary information relating
 to lines, slopes and grades. These stakes and marks shall constitute the
 field control by and in accordance with which the contractor shall establish
 other necessary controls and perform the work.
 The contractor shall be responsible for preservation of all stakes and
 marks. When any construction stakes or marks have been carelessly or
 willfully destroyed or disturbed by the contractor, the cost of replacing
 same will be at no direct pay.
 105.09 AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF PROJECT ENGINEER. As
 the direct representative of the Chief Engineer, the Project Engineer has
 immediate charge of the Department's engineering details of the
 construction project. The Project Engineer is responsible for administration
 of the contract. The Project Engineer shall have authority to give directions
 pertaining to the work in the interest of the public, to reject defective work,
 materials, and equipment, and to suspend work in accordance with 105.01.
 Except as permitted and instructed by the Chief Engineer, the Project
 Engineer is not authorized to alter or waive provisions of the contract, alter
 quantities, order extra and force account work, or accept any portion of the
 project. In no case will the Project Engineer perform any duties for or act
 as the representative of the contractor.
 When the work is being done by force account, the contractor shall have
 the responsibility to supervise the work and provide a product meeting the
 requirements of the contract. The Project Engineer, for force account
 only, shall have the authority to require the contractor to revise operations,
 47
 
 including but not limited to, sequence and location of work; number,
 category and caliber of workers; number and type of equipment; and hours
 of work.
 105.10 DUTIES OF THE INSPECTOR. Inspectors representing the
 Department are authorized to inspect all work. Such inspection extends to
 any part of the work and to preparation, fabrication or manufacture of
 materials to be used. The inspector is not authorized to alter or waive
 contract provisions. The inspector is not authorized to issue instructions
 contrary to the contract; however, the inspector will have authority to reject
 work or materials until any question can be referred to and decided by the
 engineer. In no case will the inspector perform any duties for, or act as the
 representative of the contractor.
 105.11 INSPECTION OF WORK. All materials and each part or detail
 of the work shall be subject to inspection by the engineer. The engineer
 shall be allowed safe and convenient access to all parts of the work,
 including fabrication facilities, and shall be furnished with such
 information and assistance by the contractor as required to make a
 complete inspection. Such inspection will not relieve the contractor from
 the obligation to furnish acceptable materials or to perform all work in
 accordance with the contract.
 If ordered by the engineer, the contractor, at any time before acceptance
 of the work, shall remove or uncover such portions of the finished work as
 directed. After examination, the contractor shall restore said portions of
 the work to the standard required by the project specifications. Should the
 work thus exposed prove acceptable, the uncovering or removing, and the
 replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will be paid
 for as extra work; but, should the work so exposed prove unacceptable, the
 uncovering or removing, any testing of the work, and the replacing of the
 covering or making good of the parts removed will be at no direct pay.
 Force account records shall be kept to document possible reimbursement.
 Work done or materials used without supervision or inspection by an
 authorized Department representative, and/or when the Department is not
 provided a minimum forty-eight hour notice or opportunity to provide
 inspection, may be ordered uncovered for examination and/or testing, and
 recovered, or removed and replaced, all at no expense to the Department.
 When a unit of government or political subdivision or other public or
 private entity is to pay a portion of the cost of the work covered by the
 contract, its representatives shall have the right to inspect the work. Such
 48
 
 inspection shall not make any unit of government, political subdivision, or
 corporation a party to the contract and shall not interfere with the rights of
 either party thereunder.
 105.12 INSPECTOR'S STAMP FOR SHIPMENT.
 105.12.1 Approval for Shipment: When materials requiring shop
 or plant inspection are ready for shipment, the Department's inspector or
 representative shall affix the stamp of the Department. Concrete girders,
 piles, and major structural members are stamped. For other minor
 members or items, the shipping list or manifest will be stamped.
 Application of the inspector's stamp implies that at the time of stamping
 it was the opinion of the inspector that the product was fabricated or
 manufactured from accepted materials by approved processes and painted,
 if required, in accordance with the contract. Application of the inspector's
 stamp for shipment does not imply that the products will not be rejected by
 the Department if subsequently found to be defective. Application of the
 inspector’s stamp does not transfer risk of loss of the fabricated material to
 the Department.
 105.12.2 Rejection:
 The inspector will reject material and
 workmanship that do not conform to the contract.
 Stamping of products by Department representatives shall not preclude
 further testing and inspection by the Department.
 Defective materials and workmanship, whenever discovered, will be
 rejected and shall be repaired or replaced at no direct pay. All repair
 procedures shall be subject to acceptance by the Department.
 105.12.3 Shipment of Material Not Stamped: Materials and
 fabricated items subjected to shop inspection will not be accepted at the
 project site if they do not bear the inspector's stamp for shipment. If the
 products are not stamped because they were not offered for shop
 inspection, or were shipped after rejection at the shop, the products shall be
 returned to the shop for inspection and correction as necessary.
 In lieu of this requirement, the Department may allow inspection to be
 performed at the project site at no expense to the Department.
 105.13 REMOVAL OF UNACCEPTABLE AND UNAUTHORIZED
 WORK. Work not conforming to the contract will be considered
 unacceptable, unless otherwise determined acceptable under the provisions
 in 105.03. The engineer may require testing of any work to determine if
 such work is acceptable. The engineer shall determine the nature and
 extent of the tests, which shall be paid in accordance with 105.11.
 49
 
 Unacceptable work found to exist prior to final acceptance of the work
 shall be removed and acceptably replaced, or repaired to the Department’s
 satisfaction.
 No work shall be done without lines and grades having been given by
 the engineer, except that work which is specified as construction layout.
 No payment will be made for work done contrary to instructions of the
 engineer, work done beyond lines shown on the plans or as given, or extra
 work done without authority. Work so done may be ordered removed or
 replaced at no expense to the Department.
 Upon failure of the contractor to comply with any order of the engineer
 made under the provisions of this subsection, the engineer will have
 authority to cause unacceptable work to be remedied, or removed and
 replaced, or have unacceptable work to be remedied, or removed and
 replaced by a third party, and to deduct the costs therefrom from payments
 to the contractor. The contractor and its surety shall be solidarily liable for
 any expense incurred by the Department pursuant to this provision in
 excess of any remaining amounts due the contractor under the contract.
 105.14 LOAD RESTRICTIONS. The contractor, subcontractors, or
 their suppliers shall observe all road and bridge legal load restrictions when
 hauling equipment or materials on public roads beyond project limits. A
 special permit does not decrease the contractor's liability for damage.
 Except for equipment specified in the contract, contractor shall obtain the
 engineer's written permission to exceed legal load limits within the project
 limits. Operating equipment or hauling loads that may damage structures,
 roadway, or any construction is prohibited.
 The Department may require the Contractor to provide, for structures
 within the project limits short-term load impacts to facilitate the permitting
 of highway traffic, and/or a complete structural impact analysis prepared
 by a professional civil engineer registered in Louisiana to verify that the
 existing structure and/or foundation can withstand any dead, live, and wind
 loads imposed without causing overstress, or compromising the structural
 integrity of the structure and/or foundation. In any such analysis, live loads
 on structures and/or foundations shall include Louisiana legal highway
 loads or special permitted loads as given by the Department/project
 documents.
 The contractor may be required to provide a structural analysis, if the
 contractor’s operations, equipment or material loading, could compromise
 the structural integrity of the structure and/or foundation. In these cases the
 costs of the analysis shall be at the contractor’s expense. This evaluation
 50
 
 shall include loading from traffic, as indicated in the contract, on the
 bridge, construction loads, and the dead loading of the bridge.
 In the event the Department asks for a structural analysis due to a
 permitted load above that which is outlined in the contract to be expected,
 the costs of the analysis shall be at the Department’s expense.
 105.15 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION. The contractor
 shall satisfactorily maintain the entire area within the project, from the
 effective date of the Notice to Proceed until the date of final acceptance.
 This maintenance responsibility includes, but is not necessarily limited to,
 maintaining drainage, periodic mowing (not to exceed four times per
 calendar year) and removing of debris and remains, to the satisfaction of
 the engineer, as well as such striping, patching and shoulder maintenance
 which will provide safe and convenient conditions at all times for the
 public. The contractor shall continuously and effectively satisfy his
 maintenance responsibilities with such equipment and forces as may be
 necessary to maintain a safe and satisfactory condition for the duration of
 the project.
 The contractor shall maintain the roadway in accordance with Section
 402 and in a satisfactory condition to allow traffic to safely travel through
 the work zone at the posted speed limit.
 Adjacent and parallel roadways within the project limits, not affected by
 construction shall not be the maintenance responsibility of the contractor.
 105.16 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ROADWAY OR STRUCTURE. If
 the contractor fails to comply with 104.03, 104.04, 105.15, the provisions
 of Section 107, or fails to perform any work for which the contractor is
 responsible that necessitates correction, the engineer will notify the
 contractor in writing of such noncompliance. In writing, the contractor will
 acknowledge receipt of said notice and will advise when the correction will
 be made.
 If the contractor fails to remedy a deficient condition involving traffic or
 site maintenance within 24 hours after receipt of the written notice, or
 within a reasonable amount of time for other noncompliance conditions,
 the Department will have the option to immediately remedy the condition
 with its own in-house forces or by another contractor, and the cost thereof
 will be deducted from payments for the work.
 When the condition requires more immediate remedy due to hazard to life,
 health, or property, the engineer may immediately remedy the condition as
 above and the costs thereof will be deducted from payments for the work.
 51
 
 The contractor and its surety shall be solidarily liable for any expense
 incurred by the Department pursuant to this provision in excess of any
 remaining amounts due the contractor under the contract.
 105.17 ACCEPTANCE.
 105.17.1 Partial Acceptance: When the contractor satisfactorily
 completes a portion of the project that can be used advantageously for
 traffic or other use, the contractor may request the engineer to make final
 inspection of that portion. When the engineer finds upon inspection that
 the portion has been completed in compliance with the contract, the
 engineer may accept that portion as being completed and the contractor
 will be relieved of further responsibility for that portion and from further
 liability to the public.
 Partial acceptance of a project will not be made until the portion being
 accepted has been completed in its entirety, including all safety devices,
 signs and striping. When partial acceptance is made, the terms of
 acceptance, including the responsibilities of all parties and any allowance
 of additional contract time, shall be set forth in a change order, mutually
 agreed to by the engineer and the contractor. Such partial acceptance shall
 not void or alter any terms of the contract, except as set forth in the change
 order.
 105.17.2 Final Acceptance: Upon notice from the contractor of
 presumptive completion of the entire project, the engineer will make an
 inspection. When the inspection discloses any work as being
 unsatisfactory, the engineer will give the contractor instructions for
 correction of same. The contractor shall immediately comply with such
 instructions. If contract time is stopped by the engineer, all corrections
 shall be completed within 30 calendar days or contract time will resume
 along with any additional stipulated damages. Upon correction of the
 work, another inspection will be made which will constitute final
 inspection provided the work has been satisfactorily completed. In such
 event, the engineer will notify the contractor in writing of the acceptance.
 When all the work provided for in the contract is found satisfactorily
 completed, that inspection will constitute the final inspection. The Project
 Engineer will recommend final acceptance to the Chief Engineer. Upon
 final acceptance by the Chief Engineer, the contractor will be notified in
 writing.
 
 52
 
 105.18 CLAIMS FOR ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION. If the
 contractor deems additional compensation is due for work, material, delays,
 inefficiencies, disruptions or other additional costs or expenses reportedly
 not covered in the contract or not ordered as extra work, the contractor
 shall notify the engineer in writing of his intention to make a claim for such
 additional compensation before beginning the work on which the claim is
 based or immediately upon encountering the conditions or effects which
 the contractor claims entitle him to additional compensation. Notification
 of a claim shall conform to the requirements of EDSM III.1.1.28.
 Notification must be timely given. The engineer must be afforded a
 reasonable opportunity and proper facilities by the contractor for keeping
 account of actual costs incurred by the contractor related to the claim.
 However, such notice by the contractor and the fact that the engineer has
 kept account of the costs as aforesaid shall not be construed as proving or
 substantiating the validity of any claim. Within thirty calendar days after
 the completion of the event that caused the claim, contractor must submit
 its sworn Request for Additional Compensation in accordance with the
 requirements of EDSM III.1.1.28.
 If notification and a Request for Additional Compensation is not given
 or the engineer is not afforded proper facilities by the contractor for
 keeping an account of actual costs incurred by the contractor, the contractor
 hereby agrees and shall waive any claim for such additional compensation.
 If the claim, after consideration by the Chief Engineer, or judicial
 determination, is found to be just, payment will be made as specified in
 109.04, by force account or negotiated price. Nothing in this subsection
 shall be construed as establishing any claim contrary to 104.02.
 105.19 BIDDER INQUIRIES, CONTRACTOR REQUESTS AND
 PROPOSALS. Prior to bid, bidders may submit questions seeking
 clarification of the construction proposal, specifications, or project plans
 through Falcon. After award of the contract, the contractor may submit to
 the engineer requests and proposals as provided below.
 105.19.1 Bidder Inquiries: Submit questions seeking clarification of
 the construction proposal, specifications, or project plans via
 Falcon. Questions answered will be posted for viewing by all prospective
 bidders. Questions determined by the Department to be submitted
 untimely, or less than forty eight hours prior to Bid, may not be answered.
 In addition, the Department reserves the right to not post any unsuitable
 question or any statement of fact or opinion not made for the purpose of
 seeking clarification of plans and/or project specifications.
 53
 
 105.19.2 Requests for Information (RFI): RFI submittals are
 written communication tools used to request clarification of plans and
 specifications after contract award. Number RFIs sequentially and submit
 them on forms provided by the Department’s Construction Section. There
 will be no cost to the contractor for any Department expense related thereto
 when an RFI pertains to clarification of plans or specifications. Reputed
 RFIs found by the Department as not pertaining to plan or specification
 clarification will be returned to the contractor for resubmission as a VE or
 Contractor Proposal.
 105.19.3 Value Engineering (VE) Proposals: After award of the
 contract, the contractor will be permitted to submit to the engineer written
 VE Proposals for modifying the plans, specifications, or other requirements
 of the contract for the purpose of reducing the total cost of construction.
 This process serves to share with the contractor only the construction
 cost savings generated on this contract as a result of a VE Proposal(s)
 offered by the contractor and approved by the Department. The provisions
 of this subsection shall not, however, be construed to require the
 Department to consider any VE Proposal which may be submitted. The
 Department reserves the right to reject any and all VE Proposals at any
 time in the process.
 Any time savings resulting from a VE Proposal will be considered at the
 completion of the project as an incentive to the contractor, provided the
 contract contains an incentive clause for early completion of the work and
 the contractor has not met the incentive limit in the contract. A time only
 reduction will not be considered as a VE Proposal. The purpose is to
 encourage the use of the contractor's ingenuity and experience in arriving at
 alternative construction methods, which will reduce the overall
 construction cost.
 The VE Proposal shall satisfy all design criteria and not impair, in any
 manner, the essential functions and characteristics of the project as
 determined by the Department.
 The VE Proposal shall be specifically identified by the contractor as a
 cost reduction proposal. VE Proposals will be considered by the
 Department in the same manner as change orders.
 Submit a written conceptual VE Proposal to the Project Engineer. The
 Project Engineer will disseminate this proposal to the appropriate parties
 within the Department for determining its potential acceptability.
 The conceptual VE Proposal shall provide the following minimum
 information:
 54
 
 1. A description of the proposal.
 2. A listing of work and pay items affected, added, or eliminated by
 the proposed change, including any change in contract time and/or traffic
 maintenance.
 3. An initial estimate of the net construction cost savings which the
 change is expected to generate, including elimination of any planned work.
 The contractor may proceed to the formal VE Proposal upon the
 Department's acceptance of the conceptual VE Proposal. The Department
 is not obligated to approve the contractor's formal VE Proposal, even if the
 conceptual VE Proposal is initially considered acceptable.
 As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the
 contractor with the formal VE Proposal.
 1. A statement that the proposal is submitted as a VE Proposal.
 2. A description of the difference between the existing contract
 requirements and the proposed change(s), and the comparative advantages
 and disadvantages of each, including effects on service life, economy of
 operations, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, necessary
 standardized features, reliability, traffic flow during construction, safety,
 and contract time.
 3. Revised contract plan sheets, specifications, and engineering
 calculations, all sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer
 licensed to practice in the State of Louisiana.
 4. Detailed estimates of the cost to the Department for performing
 the work under the existing contract and under the VE Proposal, including
 a listing of contract items affected by the proposal, and quantity variations
 attributable thereto with the related costs.
 5. An assessment of any effects that adoption of the VE Proposal
 could have on other costs to the Department, including future maintenance
 and operation.
 6. A statement of the latest time or date that the VE Proposal must
 be executed in order to obtain the maximum cost reduction and the
 reasoning for this time schedule.
 7. A statement of the effect that adoption of the VE Proposal will
 have on the time for completion of the contract.
 8. A description of any previous use or testing of the final VE
 Proposal on another Department project or elsewhere and the conditions
 and results therewith. If the final VE Proposal was previously submitted on
 another Department project, indicate the date, the project, and the action
 taken by the Department.
 The proposal execution date submitted by the contractor must allow the
 55
 
 Department time for review and processing of a change order. Should the
 Department find insufficient time is available for review and processing, it
 may reject the VE Proposal on such basis. If the Department fails to
 respond to the VE Proposal by the date or time specified, the contractor
 shall consider the proposal rejected, and shall have no claim against the
 Department.
 Proposed changes in basic configuration and design of a bridge,
 hydraulic capacity of drainage facilities, typical roadway section, type or
 minimum thickness of pavements, or changes in grade or alignment which
 do not meet the geometric standards of the project as conceived, will not be
 considered as acceptable VE Proposals. Typically, changes in materials for
 roadway sections will also not be considered as acceptable VE proposals.
 Plan errors which are identified by the contractor and result in a cost
 reduction will not qualify as a VE Proposal. If the Department is already
 considering certain revisions to the contract or has approved certain
 changes in the contract for general use, which are subsequently
 incorporated in a VE Proposal, the Department will reject the contractor's
 proposal and may proceed without obligation to the contractor. The
 Department will not be liable to the contractor for failure to act upon or
 accept any VE Proposal nor for any delays to the work attributable to any
 such proposal. The contractor may withdraw, in whole or in part, any VE
 Proposal not accepted by the Department within the period specified in the
 proposal. The decision of the Department as to the acceptance or rejection
 of VE Proposals shall be final and shall not be subject to the provisions of
 105.18.
 The contractor will be notified in writing of the Department's decision
 to accept or reject each VE Proposal submitted under these provisions. If a
 VE Proposal is accepted, the necessary contract modifications will be
 implemented by execution of a change order, which will provide for
 equitable price adjustments giving the contractor and the Department equal
 shares in the resulting net savings. Until a VE Proposal is affected by such
 contract modification, the contractor shall perform the work in accordance
 with the terms of the existing contract.
 The net cost savings to be shared shall be determined as the difference
 in costs between the original contract costs for the involved work items and
 the actual final costs to the Department occurring as a result of the
 proposed change. Only those work items directly affected by the change
 order will be considered in making the final determination of net cost
 savings. Subsequent change orders affecting the modified work items but
 not related to the VE Proposal, will be excluded from such determination.
 56
 
 In reviewing the VE Proposal, the Department reserves the right to reject
 the proposal if, in its judgment, the proposed net cost savings do not
 represent a reasonable measure of the value of the work to be performed or
 deleted.
 All costs incurred by the contractor in developing the VE Proposal shall
 be borne by the contractor. These costs include, but are not limited to, all
 expenses to prepare the VE Proposal, the engineering costs, including the
 Department’s review cost, cost of printing and copying any revised plan
 sheets, delivery costs, and any other cost as determined by the engineer to
 be required for proper justification of the VE Proposal.
 The change order implementing the necessary contract modifications
 shall include a pay item for and a lump sum estimate of the approximate
 net cost savings anticipated as a result of the VE Proposal, and a
 proportionate amount thereof shall be included in partial payment estimates
 as the work on the modified contract items is performed. The contractor's
 50 percent share of the net cost savings shall constitute full compensation
 for implementing all changes pursuant to the agreement. Any time savings
 for early completion of the project resulting from the VE Proposal will be
 considered upon completion of the project as an incentive to the contractor
 provided the contract contains an incentive clause for early completion of
 the work and the contractor has not met the incentive limit in the contract.
 The Department reserves the right to include in the agreement any
 conditions it deems appropriate for consideration, approval, and
 implementation of the VE Proposal. The Department also reserves the right
 to require the contractor to share in or reimburse the Department's costs of
 investigating a VE Proposal submitted by the contractor as a condition of
 considering such proposal. The Department will have the option to
 perform the investigation in-house or by consultants. When such a
 condition is imposed, the contractor shall indicate his acceptance in
 writing, and such acceptance shall constitute full authority for the
 Department to deduct amounts payable to the Department from any monies
 due or that may become due to the contractor under the contract.
 The Department reserves the right to adopt a VE Proposal for general
 use when it determines that said proposal is suitable for application to other
 contracts. When an accepted VE Proposal is adopted for general use, only
 the contractor who first submitted such proposal will be eligible for
 compensation pursuant to this subsection, and in that case, only as to those
 contracts awarded to him prior to submission of the accepted proposal. VE
 Proposals identical or similar to previously submitted proposals will be
 eligible for consideration and compensation under these provisions if the
 57
 
 identical or similar previously submitted proposals were not adopted for
 general application to other Department contracts. Subject to the provisions
 contained herein, the State or any other public agency shall have the right
 to use all or any part of any submitted VE Proposal without obligation or
 compensation of any kind to the contractor.
 Any changed conditions arising as a result of the acceptance of a VE
 Proposal will not be considered as the basis for any claim for additional
 compensation.
 105.19.4 Contractor Proposals: This provision is to modify the
 contract as a result of a Contractor Proposal(s) offered by the contractor
 and accepted by the Department. No modification will be permitted which
 alters the nature of the project or which is not an integral part of the project
 objective. Contractor Proposal(s) may decrease or increase construction
 cost. In the case of a decrease in construction cost, the Department will
 modify the contract to decrease the construction cost in accordance with
 the proposal. In the case of an increase in construction cost, the Department
 will either modify the contract to increase the construction cost or require
 the contractor to complete the contract at the contract bid prices. The
 Department reserves the right to reject a Contractor Proposal at any time
 during the submittal and review process.
 Proposed changes in typical roadway section, type, minimum thickness
 of pavements, or changes in grade or alignment, which do not meet the
 geometric standards of the project as designed, will not be considered as
 acceptable Contractor Proposals. Typically, changes in materials for
 roadway sections will not be considered as acceptable Contractor
 Proposals.
 The Contractor Proposal shall satisfy all design criteria and not impair
 the essential functions and characteristics of the project, as determined by
 the Department.
 Submit a written conceptual Contractor Proposal to the Department for
 determining potential acceptability. Provide the following conceptual
 Contractor Proposal information at a minimum:
 1. A description of the proposal.
 2. A description of the difference between the existing contract
 requirements and the proposed change(s), and the comparative advantages
 and disadvantages of each, including effects on service life, economy of
 operations, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, necessary
 standardized features, reliability, traffic flow during construction, safety,
 and contract time.
 3. A listing of work items and pay items affected, added, or
 58
 
 eliminated by the proposed change, including any change in contract time
 and/or traffic maintenance.
 4. An initial estimate of the construction cost decrease or increase
 resulting from the proposed Contract modifications.
 Upon Department written notification that the conceptual Contractor
 Proposal indicates proposal acceptability, develop and submit a written
 formal Contractor Proposal. The Department is not obligated to accept the
 formal Contractor Proposal, even if the conceptual Contractor Proposal
 indicates proposal acceptability.
 Provide the following formal Contractor Proposal information as a
 minimum:
 1. A statement that the proposal is submitted as a Contractor
 Proposal.
 2. A description of the difference between the existing contract
 requirements and the proposed change(s), and the comparative advantages
 and disadvantages of each, including effects on service life, economy of
 operations, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, necessary
 standardized features, reliability, traffic flow during construction, safety,
 contract time, and other factors as appropriate.
 3. Revised contract plan sheets, specifications, and engineering
 calculations, all sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer
 licensed to practice in the State of Louisiana.
 4. Detailed estimates of the cost to the Department for performing
 the work under the existing contract and under the Contractor Proposal,
 including a listing of contract items affected by the proposal and quantity
 variations attributable thereto with the related costs. Describe new contract
 items that are required.
 5. An assessment of any effects that adoption of the Contractor
 Proposal could have on other costs to the Department, including future
 maintenance and operation.
 6. A statement of the latest time or date that the Contractor Proposal
 must be executed and the reasoning for this time schedule.
 7. A statement of the effect that adoption of the Contractor Proposal
 will have on the time for completion of the contract.
 8. A description of any previous use or testing of the final Contractor
 Proposal on another Department project or elsewhere and the conditions
 and results therewith. If the final Contractor Proposal was previously
 submitted on another Department project, indicate the date, the project, and
 the action taken by the Department.
 The proposal execution date submitted by the contractor must allow the
 59
 
 Department time for review and processing of a change order. Should the
 Department find insufficient time is available for review and processing, it
 may reject the Proposal on such basis. If the Department fails to respond to
 the Proposal by the date or time specified, the contractor shall consider the
 proposal rejected and shall have no claim against the Department.
 The bidder is cautioned not to base any bid prices on the anticipated
 approval of a Contractor Proposal and to recognize that the proposal may
 be rejected. In the event of rejection, the contractor will be required to
 complete the contract at the contract bid prices.
 The Department will not be liable to the contractor for failure to act
 upon or accept any Contractor Proposal nor for any delays to the work
 attributable to any such proposal. The contractor may withdraw, in whole
 or in part, any Contractor Proposal not accepted by the Department within
 the period specified in the proposal. The decision of the Department as to
 the acceptance or rejection of Contractor Proposals shall be final and shall
 not be subject to the provisions of 105.18.
 The contractor will be notified in writing of the Department's
 decision to accept or reject each Contractor Proposal submitted under these
 provisions. If a Contractor Proposal is accepted, the necessary contract
 modifications will be implemented by execution of a change order. Until a
 Contractor Proposal is affected by such contract modification, the
 contractor shall perform the work in accordance with the terms of the
 existing contract.
 All costs incurred by the contractor in developing the Contractor
 Proposal and Department review cost will be borne by the contractor,
 regardless of whether or not the Contractor Proposal is implemented.
 The Department reserves the right to include in the agreement any
 conditions it deems appropriate for consideration, acceptance, and
 implementation of the Contractor Proposal.
 The Department reserves the right to adopt a Contractor Proposal for
 general use when it determines that said proposal is suitable for application
 to other contracts. Subject to the provisions contained herein, the State or
 any other public agency shall have the right to use all or any part of any
 submitted Contractor Proposal without obligation or compensation of any
 kind to the contractor.
 Any changed conditions arising as a result of the acceptance of a
 Contractor Proposal will not be considered as the basis for any claim for
 additional compensation.

 Section 106
 Control of Materials
 106.01 SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS.
 Materials used in the work shall meet all quality requirements of the
 contract. To expedite inspection and testing of materials, the contractor
 shall notify the engineer of his proposed sources of materials at least three
 weeks prior to delivery. With written authorization, materials may be
 approved at the source of supply before delivery is started. If it is found
 after installation that sources of supply for previously approved materials
 do not produce specified products or results, the contractor shall furnish
 materials from other sources or make necessary changes to provide
 acceptable materials at no cost to the department.
 106.02 LOCAL MATERIAL SOURCES.
 106.02.1 Designated Sources: Possible sources of local materials
 may be designated on the plans or in the specifications. The quality of
 material in such deposits will be acceptable in general, but the contractor
 shall determine the amount of equipment and work required to produce a
 material meeting specifications. It shall be understood that it is not feasible
 to ascertain from samples the limits for an entire deposit and that variations
 are to be expected. The engineer may order procurement of material from
 any portion of a deposit and may reject portions of the deposit as
 unacceptable.
 The Department may acquire and make available to the contractor the
 right to take materials from the sources designated on the plans or in the
 specifications, with the right to use such property as specified for plant site,
 stockpiles or haul roads.
 When the contractor desires to use material from sources other than
 those designated, the contractor shall acquire the necessary rights or
 permits to take materials from the sources and shall pay all costs related
 thereto, including any which may result from increased haul length. All
 costs of exploring and developing such sources shall be borne by the
 contractor. Use of material from other than designated sources will not be
 permitted until representative samples taken by the engineer have been
 approved and written authority is issued for the use thereof.
 106.02.2 Contractor Furnished Sources: When material deposits
 are not designated in the plans or specifications, the contractor shall
 61
 
 provide sources of acceptable material. When sources of materials are
 provided by the contractor, the Department may assume the cost of
 processing samples to determine suitability of material.
 106.02.3 Use of Materials Found on the Project: Unless
 otherwise specified, the contractor may incorporate into the work materials
 found or produced on the project, such as reclaimed asphalt pavement,
 recycled portland cement concrete, stone, gravel, sand, topsoil or other
 materials provided they meet the requirements of the use specified.
 Payment for removal of such materials will be made under the designated
 contract items such as cold planing asphalt pavement, removal of portland
 cement concrete pavement, excavation, etc. Payment will also be made for
 the pay items into which these materials are incorporated.
 The contractor shall replace at no direct pay with acceptable material all
 removed material which was needed for embankments, backfills,
 approaches or otherwise. No charge for materials so used will be made
 against the contractor. The contractor shall not excavate or remove
 material from within the right-of-way which is not within construction
 limits, as indicated by slope and grade lines, without written authorization
 from the engineer. If authorization is obtained, payment will not be made
 for excavation beyond slope and grade lines, nor will payment be made for
 any required replacement.
 Materials from existing structures may be used temporarily by the
 contractor in erection of new structures. Modification of such material will
 not be permitted without written approval.
 106.03 ACCEPTANCE SAMPLES AND TESTS. Materials will be
 inspected, tested, and approved before incorporation into the work. Work
 in which untested and unapproved materials are used shall be performed at
 the contractor's risk. Payment will not be made for materials or work found
 to be unacceptable and, when directed, shall be removed at the contractor's
 expense.
 Unless otherwise specified in the contract, sample and test per the
 Department’s Materials Sampling Manual or as directed by the Materials
 Engineer. When the sample or test method is not cited, the following
 hierarchy applies:
 1. DOTD Testing Procedures Manual
 2. AASHTO Methods
 3. ASTM Methods
 Resampling or retesting procedures shall be as determined by the
 Department's Materials Engineer Administrator.
 When allowable
 62
 
 variations or conflicts occur within an ASTM or AASHTO test procedure,
 the established DOTD procedure and publications or hierarchy established
 above shall govern. All procedures will be the most recent cited which are
 current on the first date of advertisement for bids. Acceptance testing will
 be made or witnessed by the Department. Samples for acceptance testing
 will be taken by an authorized representative of the Department. Materials
 being used will be subject to inspection, sampling, testing, retesting, or
 rejection at any time prior to final acceptance. The contractor will be
 notified of the Department’s failing test. Copies of all tests reports will be
 furnished to the contractor's representative upon request.
 The contractor shall supply materials approved by the Department as
 published in the Approved Materials List. However, inclusion of a product
 on the Approved Materials List is not a blanket approval for its use in the
 work, as products are still subject to the requirements of the Materials
 Sampling Manual. The Approved Materials List may be revised at any
 time, and only materials approved at the time of construction will be
 allowed on the project.
 106.04 CERTIFICATES. Certificates shall include Certificates of
 Analysis, Certificates of Compliance, and Certificates of Delivery. These
 certificates shall be furnished prior to use of materials for which the
 certificates are required.
 They shall be signed by the material
 manufacturer, the manufacturer of assembled materials or the material
 supplier. If the contract has a Buy America provision, the certificates must
 indicate compliance with the provision.
 Materials used on the basis of these certificates may be sampled and
 tested at any time. The fact that material is used on the basis of a
 certificate shall not relieve the contractor of responsibility for incorporating
 material in the work which conforms to the plans and specifications.
 Distribution of certificates and requirements for further sampling and
 testing of certified materials shall be as outlined in the Department's
 Materials Sampling Manual.
 The Department reserves the right to refuse to permit the use of material on
 the basis of a certificate.
 106.05 CONTRACTOR QUALITY CONTROL. The contractor shall
 establish and maintain an effective quality control process. The quality
 control process shall consist of plans, procedures, and organization
 necessary to provide materials, equipment, workmanship, fabrication,
 construction and operations which comply with the contract requirements.
 63
 
 The process shall cover all operations both onsite and offsite, and shall be
 keyed to the proposed construction sequence.
 The Contractor is
 responsible for all subcontractors’ quality control.
 Comply with all requirements in the latest edition of the Department’s
 Quality Assurance Manual” for the appropriate specification section.
 Contractor personnel performing sampling and testing, observation, or
 inspection for the quality control process shall be evaluated and accepted
 by the Department in accordance with Departmental requirements.
 Contractor personnel shall have appropriate training and experience in
 testing procedures and methods of construction for the work they are
 overseeing. When specifications allow using quality control test results in
 the acceptance decision, contractor use of an accredited laboratory and
 certified inspectors is required, or, for materials not normally accredited,
 certification by a licensed Engineer in the State of Louisiana.
 106.06 PLANT INSPECTION. The Department reserves the right to
 inspect plants and operations producing materials and to test materials prior
 to incorporation into the work as necessary to ensure contract compliance.
 When plant inspection is undertaken, the following conditions shall be met:
 1. The Department shall have the cooperation and assistance of the
 contractor and the producer with whom the contractor has contracted for
 materials.
 2. The Department shall have entry at all times to such parts of the plant
 related to manufacturing or production of materials being furnished.
 Certification of specified plants and operations will be in accordance with
 Department requirements.
 106.07 FIELD LABORATORY. The contractor shall provide project
 site laboratories as required by the specifications to be used exclusively for
 material acceptance purposes by the Department. The buildings shall be
 installed, furnished, equipped and maintained in accordance with Section
 722, and ready for use prior to the time the contractor's operations require
 testing.
 106.08 FOREIGN MATERIALS. Materials manufactured outside the
 United States shall be delivered to approved locations within the United
 States, where they shall be retained until sampling and testing can be
 completed.
 Testing by the contractor shall be performed within the State at the
 contractor’s expense, and be subject to witnessing by the engineer.
 64
 
 Each lot of foreign material shall be accompanied by a Certificate of
 Compliance prepared in accordance with 106.04. Certificates of Analysis
 prepared in accordance with 106.04 shall be attached to the Certificate of
 Compliance for those materials for which Certificates of Analysis are
 required. These certificates shall clearly identify the lot to which they
 apply.
 Structural materials requiring Certificates of Analysis (Mill Test
 Reports) will be accepted only from foreign manufacturers who have
 previously established to the satisfaction of the engineer the adequacy of
 their in-plant quality control.
 Adequacy of quality control shall be established, at the option of the
 engineer, by submission of detailed written proof of adequate quality
 control or through a plant inspection by the engineer.
 No structural materials will be accepted which cannot be properly
 identified with Certificates of Analysis and Certificates of Compliance.
 106.09 MATERIAL STORAGE AND PLANT SITE. Materials shall
 be stored and/or stockpiled to assure preservation of their quality and
 fitness for the work. Such materials, even though accepted before storage,
 may again be inspected prior to their use in the work. Stored and/or
 stockpiled materials shall be located to facilitate their prompt inspection.
 Approved portions of the right-of-way may be used for storage and for
 placing the contractor's plant and equipment. Additional space required
 shall be provided by the contractor at no direct pay.
 106.10 HANDLING MATERIALS. Materials shall be handled to
 preserve their quality and fitness for the work. Transport materials from
 the storage site to the work in vehicles constructed to prevent loss or
 segregation of materials after loading and measurement, ensuring
 consistent quantities of materials loaded and consistent quantities received
 at the place of operations.
 106.11 UNACCEPTABLE MATERIALS. Materials not conforming to
 specifications will be rejected and shall be removed immediately from the
 work site, unless otherwise directed by the engineer. In addition, if
 required by the engineer, a sample of the rejected material shall be
 preserved and delivered to the Department as directed at no additional cost
 or expense to the Department. No rejected material shall be used until the
 defects have been corrected and subsequent additional approval has been
 given.
 65
 
 106.12 DEPARTMENT-FURNISHED MATERIAL. The contractor
 shall furnish all materials required to complete the work, except those
 specified to be furnished by the Department.
 Material furnished by the Department will be delivered or made
 available to the contractor at the points specified.
 The cost of handling and placing materials after they are delivered to the
 contractor shall be considered as included in the contract price for the item
 in connection with which they are used.
 The contractor will be responsible for material delivered. Deductions
 will be made from payments for the work to make good any shortages and
 deficiencies, for any damage which occurs after such delivery, and for any
 demurrage charges.
 
 66
 
 Section 107
 Legal Relations and Responsibility to Public
 107.01 LAWS TO BE OBSERVED. The contractor shall keep
 informed of and comply with all Federal, State and local laws, ordinances
 and regulations, and all orders and decrees of bodies or tribunals having
 any jurisdiction or authority, which affect those employed on the work or
 which affect the conduct of the work. The contractor shall indemnify the
 State and its representatives against any claim or liability arising from
 violation of any such law, bylaw, ordinance, code, regulation, order or
 decree, whether by the contractor or the contractor's employees.
 Soil and soil-moving equipment operating in regulated areas will be
 subject to plant quarantine regulations. These regulations provide for
 cleaning soil from equipment before it is moved from regulated areas to
 prevent spread of harmful agricultural pests from areas quarantined by the
 State or U. S. Department of Agriculture. Complete information may be
 obtained from the appropriate district office of the USDA Plant Protection
 Division.
 When the Department is the contracting agency, (1) any litigation
 arising under or related to the contract or the bidding or award thereof shall
 be instituted in the 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East
 Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, and (2) the contractor shall ensure that
 each subcontract for the project also requires that any litigation arising
 under the contract, other than to enforce a lien pursuant to L.R.S. 48:256.3
 et seq., be instituted in the 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish
 of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana.
 If any court of competent jurisdiction holds that any provision of this

 extent of any fire seen by them.
 107.14 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
 The contractor shall
 comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling
 pollution of the environment, including air, water and noise. The contractor
 shall take precautions to prevent pollution of waters and wetlands with
 fuels, oils, asphalts, chemicals, or other harmful materials and to prevent
 pollution of the atmosphere from particulate and gaseous matter. Attention
 is directed to Section 204, Temporary Erosion Control.
 The contractor certifies under penalty of law that he understands and
 will abide by the terms and conditions of the Storm Water Pollution
 Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and the National Pollution Discharge
 Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit that require the discharges
 from construction sites be managed to prevent pollutants from entering
 waters of the United States in accordance with the Environmental
 Protection Agency's (EPA) regulations for storm water discharges with
 respect to 33 U.S.C. § 1342 (Sections 402 (p) and 405 of Public Law 1004).
 The use of erosion control features or methods other than those in the
 contract shall be as directed.
 The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan shall be comprised of all
 components specified in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
 document entitled, “Storm Water Management for Construction
 Activities,” and shall include Section 204, Temporary Erosion Control of
 the standard specifications along with applicable supplemental
 specifications, special provisions, and the plans.
 Construction operations in rivers, streams, lakes, tidal waters,
 reservoirs, canals, and other impoundments will be restricted to areas
 where it is necessary to perform filling or excavation to accomplish the
 work and areas which must be entered to construct temporary or permanent
 structures. Operations in navigable waters, wetlands, or other waters of the
 United States require permits. It is the responsibility of the contractor to
 ensure all appropriate permits are obtained prior to commencement of
 82
 
 operations. As soon as conditions permit, streams and impoundments shall
 be cleared of temporary obstructions placed therein or caused by
 construction operations.
 Frequent fording of streams with construction equipment will not be
 permitted.
 No residue from dust collectors or washers shall be dumped into a
 stream. Attention is further directed to the federal, state, and local air
 pollution control programs and their rules and regulations regarding air
 pollution, especially open burning, fugitive dust and asphalt concrete plant
 restrictions.
 The contractor shall maintain and operate equipment to minimize noise
 and vibration as well as comply with local noise ordinances. Engines shall
 be equipped with properly functioning mufflers. The contractor shall
 assure the activities near noise and vibration sensitive areas, such as
 churches, hospitals, and schools are not unduly disruptive.
 107.15 AIR NAVIGATION. The Department will obtain a permit (or a
 determination of no hazard to air navigation) from the FAA for all
 permanent structures. The contractor will be furnished a copy of the permit,
 if requested. If the contractor's equipment, falsework, etc. is classified as a
 hazard to aerial navigation, the contractor shall prepare drawings
 complying with the FAA current requirements for temporary lighting for
 protection of aerial navigation. These drawings shall be submitted to the
 Bridge Design Engineer and Project Engineer for review and transmittal to
 the FAA for approval. Operations in connection with the work for
 protection of aerial navigation shall be in accordance with the approved
 drawings and applicable federal regulations. Failure of the contractor to be
 familiar with applicable rules and regulations of the FAA will not relieve
 the contractor of responsibility under the contract.
 107.16 HAZARD ZONES. If any portion of the work is determined to
 be within a known hazard zone, the presence of such hazards will be noted
 in the plans or project specifications to the extent that definite information
 can be obtained on these situations.
 It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to arrange and coordinate
 the work in the area with the agency or agencies concerned.
 The contractor shall obtain from the Department and submit to the
 engineer the Department's Standard Release Form signed by the agency
 involved stating that the contractor has satisfactorily discharged the
 obligations under terms of the arrangements. This form shall be submitted
 83
 
 with the required signatures.
 Failure of the Department to determine the presence of all hazards and
 to note same on the plans or in the project specifications shall not relieve
 the contractor from performing any required work.
 107.17 DAMAGE CLAIMS. The contractor shall indemnify, defend, and
 hold the Department, its officers and employees harmless from all suits,
 actions, or claims brought because of injuries or damage sustained by any
 person or property due to operations of the contractor in connection with
 the Contract; due to negligence in safeguarding the work; or use of
 unacceptable materials in constructing the work; or any negligent or
 intentional act, omission or misconduct of the contractor; or claims or
 amounts recovered from infringements of patent, trademark or copyright;
 or from claims or amounts arising or recovered under the Workmen's
 Compensation Act or other law, ordinance, order or decree. Any money
 due the contractor as considered necessary by the Department for such
 purpose, may be retained for use of the State; or, in case no money is due,
 the surety bond may be held until such suits, actions, claims for injuries or
 damages have been settled and suitable evidence to that effect furnished to
 the Department; except that money due the contractor will not be withheld
 when the contractor produces satisfactory evidence that adequate
 Workman's Compensation, Public Liability, and Property Damage
 Insurance are in effect.
 107.18 OPENING SECTIONS TO TRAFFIC. Opening of sections of
 the work to traffic prior to completion of the entire contract may be
 desirable from a traffic service standpoint, or may be necessary due to
 conditions inherent in the work or by changes in the contractor's work
 schedule, or may be required due to conditions or events unforeseen at the
 time of the contract. Such openings shall be made when directed and shall
 not constitute acceptance of the work nor a part thereof or a waiver of any
 provisions of the contract.
 The plans or project specifications will specify, insofar as possible,
 which sections shall be opened prior to completion of the contract. On any
 section opened by order of the engineer, when not specified, the contractor
 will not be required to assume any expense entailed in maintaining the road
 for traffic. Such expense will be borne by the Department or compensated
 for in accordance with 109.04. On portions of the project which are
 ordered to be opened for traffic, in the case of unforeseen necessity not the
 fault of the contractor, compensation for additional expense to the
 84
 
 contractor and allowance of additional time for completion of other work
 on the opened portions of the project shall be as set forth in a change order
 mutually agreed on by the engineer and the contractor.
 When the contractor's progress is undesirably slow in completing
 shoulders, drainage structures or other features of the work, the engineer
 may notify the contractor in writing and establish therein a reasonable
 period of time in which the work is to be completed. If the contractor fails
 to make a reasonable effort toward completion in this time period, the
 engineer may order all or a section of the project opened to traffic. On
 such sections ordered to be opened, the contractor shall conduct the
 remainder of construction operations to cause the least obstruction to traffic
 and shall not receive any added compensation due to the added cost of the
 work by reason of opening such section to traffic.
 On any section opened to traffic under the foregoing conditions,
 whether specified in the contract or opened by necessity of the contractor's
 operations or unforeseen necessity, any damage to the highway not
 attributable to traffic that occurs on such section (except slides) shall be
 repaired by the contractor at no direct pay. Removal of slides shall be done
 by the contractor on a basis agreed to prior to removal of such slide.
 107.19 CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORK. Until
 final acceptance, the contractor shall have garde, charge, and care of the
 work and roadway within the project limits. In addition, the contractor shall
 take every precaution against damage to any part thereof by action of the
 elements, vandalism, theft, or from any other cause. The contractor shall
 rebuild, repair, restore, or pay for damages, including theft and vandalism,
 to the work before final acceptance and shall bear the expense thereof,
 except for the following:
 1. Guard rail and impact attenuators shall be repaired as soon as
 possible after damage. If the engineer determines that the contractor did not
 contribute to the damages, the contractor shall first attempt to collect repair
 costs from responsible third parties. The Department will reimburse the
 contractor for such repairs by force account in accordance with 109.04
 when responsible parties cannot be identified.
 2. Unavoidable damage, except for materials and equipment that are not
 incorporated into the Project, due to Acts of God as defined in 101.03, or
 due to/by acts of governmental authorities.
 In case of suspension of the work, the contractor shall continue to be
 responsible for the project. The contractor shall take such precautions as
 necessary to prevent damage to the project, maintain traffic, provide for
 85
 
 normal drainage, and erect any necessary temporary structures, signs or
 other facilities at no direct pay. During such period of suspension, the
 contractor shall acceptably maintain all living material in newly established
 plantings, seedings and soddings furnished under the contract, and shall
 take adequate precautions to protect new tree growth and other important
 vegetative growth against damage. Should suspension of the work not be
 attributed to any actions of the contractor, the contractor will be reimbursed
 for additional work.
 107.20 UTILITY PROPERTY AND SERVICES. The contractor's
 operations adjacent to properties of a railway, utility companies, or other
 property, damage to which might result in considerable expense, loss, or
 inconvenience, shall not commence until after all arrangements necessary
 for the protection thereof have been made.
 The contractor shall cooperate with owners of utility lines in their
 removal and relocation, in order that these operations may progress in a
 reasonable manner, that duplication of relocation work may be minimized
 and that services rendered by those parties will not be unnecessarily
 interrupted.
 In the event of interruption of utility services due to accidental breakage
 or being exposed or unsupported, the contractor shall promptly notify the
 proper authority and shall cooperate with such authority in restoration of
 service. If utility service is interrupted, continuous cooperation will be
 required until service is restored. No work shall be undertaken around fire
 hydrants until provisions for continued service have been approved by the
 local fire authority.
 107.21 FURNISHING RIGHT-OF-WAY. The Department will be
 responsible for securing all necessary right-of-way, servitudes and
 easements in advance of construction.
 107.22 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS.
 In
 carrying out the provisions of these specifications, or in exercising any
 authority granted to them by the contract, there shall be no liability upon
 the Secretary, Chief Engineer, or their authorized representatives, either
 personally or as officials of the State, it being understood that in all such
 matters they act solely as representatives of the State.
 107.23 NO WAIVER OF LEGAL RIGHTS. Upon completion of the
 work, the Department will make final inspection and then notify the
 86
 
 contractor of acceptance within 30 calendar days. Such final acceptance
 shall not prevent the Department from correcting any measurement,
 estimate or certificate made before or after completion of the work, nor
 shall the Department be prevented from recovering from the contractor or
 the surety, or both, any overpayment it may sustain. The contractor and its
 surety shall be solidarily liable for any overpayment or added expense
 incurred by the Department, as provided in the contract or resulting from
 any deficient performance of the work, in excess of any remaining amounts
 due the contractor.
 A waiver by the Department of any breach of any part of the contract
 shall not be a waiver of any other breach.
 The contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the contract, shall be
 liable to the Department for latent defects, fraud or such mistakes as
 amount to fraud, or as regards the Department's rights under any warranty
 or guaranty.
 107.24 THIRD PARTY LIABILITY. It is agreed between the parties
 executing the contract that it is not intended by any provisions of the
 contract to create the public nor any member thereof a third party
 beneficiary hereunder, nor to authorize anyone not a party to this contract
 to maintain a suit for personal injuries or property damage pursuant to the
 contract.
 107.25 ANTI-TRUST VIOLATIONS. By execution of the contract, the
 contractor conveys to the Department all rights, title and interest in and to
 all causes of action it may acquire under Federal and State anti-trust laws,
 relating to the goods or services purchased by the Department pursuant to
 the contract.
 107.26 CONTRACTOR'S
 PAYROLLS.
 When
 predetermined
 minimum wage rates are included in the contract, the minimum wage
 determination shall be posted by the contractor in a prominent and easily
 accessible place at the site of work.
 On Federal-Aid Projects, the contractor's payrolls shall be in accordance
 with the project specifications.
 107.27 ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS
 AND UNMARKED
 BURIALS. If the contractor encounters cultural artifacts or archaeological
 or historical sites, operations in the area of the discovery shall be
 discontinued. The engineer will contact the DOTD Environmental
 87
 
 Engineer Administrator, or designee, in order that an appropriate
 assessment may be made to determine the disposition thereof and necessary
 actions relative to the site. Those decisions will be made in consultation
 with, as applicable, the State Archaeologist, the State Historic Preservation
 Officer, and the lead federal agency. When directed, the contractor shall
 perform services on the site to preserve the artifacts encountered. Such
 extra work will be paid for in accordance with 109.04, including an
 appropriate adjustment in contract time in accordance with 108.07. Borrow
 and muck disposal areas furnished by the contractor will be subject to such
 assessment by the contractor prior to use.
 If the contractor discovers unmarked burial sites, human skeletal
 remains, or burial artifacts, operations in the area of the discovery shall be
 discontinued. The contractor will notify the proper authorities, as well as
 the engineer, in compliance with the Louisiana Unmarked Human Burial
 Sites Preservation Act (RS 8:680-681).
 
 88
 
 Section 108
 Prosecution and Progress
 108.01 SUBLETTING OF CONTRACT. The contractor shall not sublet
 any portion of the contract, excluding material, without written consent,
 including work sublet to an authorized Disadvantaged Business Enterprise.
 If such consent is given, the contractor will be permitted to sublet a portion
 of the work, but shall perform with the contractor's own organization work
 amounting to at least 50 percent of the total contract amount as established
 in contractor’s bid.
 Any items designated in the contract as
 “Specialty Items” may be performed by subcontract and the cost of such
 may be deducted from the total contract cost before computing the amount
 of work required to be performed by the contractor with the contractor's
 own organization.
 The contractor shall indemnify the Department, its officers, and
 employees from any loss of any kind, including loss of funding, resulting
 from its failure to perform at least 50 percent of the total contract cost, as
 provided above.
 By executing the contract, contractor acknowledges and agrees that a
 subcontract shall incorporate all applicable requirements and provisions of
 the contract between it and the Department, including the insurance
 requirements in 107.02, and that subcontracts do not relieve contractor of
 any of its obligations, liabilities, or guarantees under this contract or
 included bonds.
 The contractor shall indemnify the Department, its officers, and
 employees from any loss of any kind, including loss of funding, resulting
 from the failure of any of its subcontractors to comply with the terms of
 this contract. Any such indemnification will be in addition to, if
 applicable, the terms of the Required Contract Provisions For DBE (or
 SBE) Participation In Federal Aid Construction Contracts.
 Any failure by the contractor to comply with the Required Contract
 Provisions For DBE Participation In Federal Aid Construction Contracts
 may result, at the discretion of the Department, in a reduction of payment
 up to the full federal participation in said payment for any item(s) of
 affected work, whether or not the work itself is acceptable. Such reduction
 may not be applied to the payment of a DBE unless the DBE is the
 proximate cause of said reduction.
 A subcontractor shall not further subcontract to a third party any portion
 of its authorized work, including work sublet to an authorized
 89
 
 Disadvantaged Business Enterprise but excluding acquisition of materials,
 without prior written consent from the Department’s Compliance Program
 and Construction Division. If consent is given, the contractor will then be
 required to submit a OMF – 1A, Request to Sublet form to the Compliance
 section.
 108.02 COMMENCEMENT OF WORK. The “Notice to Proceed” will
 stipulate the date on which the contractor shall begin work, which date
 shall be the beginning of contract time charges.
 108.03 CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS SCHEDULE. Prior to or at
 the preconstruction conference and before beginning work on the project,
 the contractor shall submit to the project engineer a Construction Progress
 Schedule giving a satisfactory schedule of operations that provides for
 completion of the work within the contract time. This schedule shall be on
 the prescribed bar graph form. The contractor shall have copies of the
 schedule available at the preconstruction conference.
 If the contractor's operations are affected by changes in the plans or
 amount of work, or if the contractor has failed to comply with the approved
 schedule, or if requested by the engineer, the contractor shall submit a
 revised Construction Progress Schedule for approval. This revised
 schedule shall show how the contractor proposes to prosecute the balance
 of the work. If a revised schedule has been requested by the engineer, the
 contractor shall submit the revised schedule within 14 calendar days after
 the date of request or progress payments may be withheld.
 The approved Construction Progress Schedule will be used as the basis
 of establishing the controlling item of work, charging contract time and as
 a check on the progress of the work. The Construction Progress Schedule
 shall show only one controlling item of work for each contract day. If the
 Construction Progress Schedule has not been approved prior to the issuance
 of the Notice to Proceed, the engineer will establish the controlling work
 item and charge contract time accordingly.
 108.04 PROSECUTION OF WORK.
 108.04.1 General: The contractor shall provide sufficient materials,
 equipment, and labor to complete the project in accordance with the plans
 and specifications within the contract time. If the completed work is behind
 the approved progress schedule, the contractor shall take immediate steps
 to restore satisfactory progress and shall not transfer equipment or forces
 from uncompleted work without prior notice to, and approval of, the
 90
 
 engineer. Each item of work shall be prosecuted to completion without
 delay. If prosecution of the work is discontinued for five contract days, the
 contractor shall give the engineer written notice at least 24 hours before
 resuming operations.
 108.04.2 Progress and Disqualification:
 The contractor's
 progress will be determined monthly at the time of each partial estimate,
 and will be based on the total amount earned by the contractor as reflected
 by the partial estimate. If the contractor's progress is more than 20 percent
 behind the elapsed contract time, the contractor may be notified that he is
 not prosecuting the work in an acceptable manner. If requested by the
 Department, the contractor must meet with and provide the project
 engineer with an acceptable written plan which details how the contractor
 will regain lost progress and prosecute the remaining work.
 When a contractor has only one project with the Department, the
 contractor shall be disqualified once contract time has expired and the
 project is less than 90% complete. The contractor shall then remain
 disqualified until the project has been completed.
 When a contractor has multiple projects with the Department, a
 contractor shall be immediately disqualified when:
 (a) its progress on one project is 50 percent or more behind the
 elapsed contract time. In such case, the contractor shall remain disqualified
 until progress is within 10 percent of the elapsed contract time. Or,
 (b) on two or more projects, contract time has expired and at least
 two such projects are less than 90% complete. The contractor shall remain
 disqualified until only one of the overdue projects remain incomplete, and
 it has achieved final acceptance of the other project(s).
 Should the surety or the Department take over prosecution of a project,
 the contractor shall remain disqualified for a period of one year from Final
 Acceptance of the project, unless the contractor is debarred.
 A contractor may also be disqualified for other causes as provided
 elsewhere in the contract. During the period of disqualification, except as
 provided elsewhere, the contractor will not be permitted to bid on
 Department contracts nor be approved as a subcontractor on Department
 projects. Any bid submitted by the contractor during the period of
 disqualification will not be considered and will be ruled irregular.
 108.04.3 Disqualification Review Board: After disqualification,
 the contractor may submit a written appeal to the Chief Engineer. The
 written appeal shall be submitted within 7 days, excluding weekends and
 holidays, after issuance of written notice of disqualification and the
 contractor may either request a meeting with the review board or that the
 91
 
 review board consider a written appeal only. A meeting of the review board
 will be scheduled within 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after
 receipt of appeal.
 The Department’s review board will be composed of the Chief
 Engineer, or his designee, and five other members appointed by the
 Secretary. The Chief Engineer, or his designee, and two other members
 will constitute a quorum.
 After all pertinent information has been considered, the contractor will
 be notified of the decision of the review board in writing within 5 days,
 excluding weekends and holidays. The decision of the review board will
 not operate as a waiver by the Department of its rights concerning the
 assessment of stipulated damages as specified under 108.08.
 When the Department of Transportation and Development is not the
 contracting agency on a project, the contracting agency will make any
 disqualification determination and the contractor shall submit its appeal to
 the appropriate agency representative for that agency to address. The
 contracting agency will request that the Department concur with their
 decision prior to notifying the Contractor in writing. The DOTD’s
 concurrence is advisory and will not make the DOTD a party to the
 contracting agency’s construction contract.
 108.05 LIMITATION OF OPERATIONS. The contractor shall conduct
 the work in such manner and sequence to assure the least interference with
 traffic. The contractor shall have due regard to the location of detours and
 provisions for handling traffic. The contractor shall not begin new work to
 the prejudice of work already started. The engineer may require the
 contractor to finish a section on which work is in progress before starting
 on additional sections if the finishing of such section is essential to public
 convenience and safety.
 108.06 LABOR, MEANS, METHODS, AND EQUIPMENT. The
 contractor shall employ sufficient labor and equipment to prosecute the
 work to completion in accordance with the contract.
 Workers shall have sufficient skill and experience to properly perform
 the work.
 Any representative of the contractor or subcontractor who, in the
 opinion of the engineer, does not perform in a skillful manner or is
 disorderly shall be, upon written request, immediately removed by the
 contractor or subcontractor. A person removed shall not return to the work
 without written approval. If the contractor fails to remove such a person or
 92
 
 fails to furnish suitable and sufficient personnel to properly prosecute the
 work, the engineer may suspend the work by written notice.
 Equipment proposed for use in the work shall be of sufficient size and
 in such mechanical condition as to meet requirements of the work and
 produce a satisfactory quality of work. No damage to the roadway,
 adjacent property or other highways shall result from the use of equipment.
 When means, methods, and equipment are not specified, the contractor
 may use any means, methods, or equipment that will accomplish the work
 in conformity with the contract.
 The contractor may request permission to use a means, method, or type
 of equipment other than specified in the contract. The request shall comply
 with 105.19.4 and shall include a description of the means, methods, and
 equipment proposed and the reasons for requesting the change. If approval
 is given, it will be on the condition that the contractor will be responsible
 for producing work in conformity with contract requirements. If, after trial
 use of the substituted means, methods, or equipment, the engineer
 determines that the work produced does not meet contract requirements,
 the contractor shall discontinue use of the substituted means, method, or
 equipment and shall complete the work with the specified means, methods,
 and equipment. The contractor shall remove the deficient work and replace
 it with work of specified quality or take other corrective action as directed.
 No change will be made in payment for pay items involved nor in contract
 time as a result of authorizing a change in means, methods, or equipment.
 108.07 DETERMINATION AND EXTENSION OF CONTRACT
 TIME. The number of days allowed for completion of the work will be
 stated in the contract.
 When the contract time is a fixed calendar date, it shall be the date on
 which all work on the project shall be completed.
 The contract time for the work as awarded is based on the original
 quantities as defined in 102.05 and includes time to procure material,
 equipment and an adequate labor force to complete the work. If
 satisfactory fulfillment of the contract requires performance of work in
 greater quantities than those specified, or requires performance of extra
 work in accordance with 104.02 and the contractor requests additional
 contract time, the document authorizing or ordering alterations will show
 the number of additional days justified.
 If the contractor finds it impossible, for reasons beyond the contractor's
 control, to complete the work within the contract time as specified or as
 extended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the
 93
 
 contractor shall, at the time the delay occurs make written request to the
 engineer for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons which
 justify granting the request. Such written request shall conform to the
 requirements of EDSM III.1.1.28. If the request does not so conform, the
 contractor hereby agrees to and shall be deemed to have expressly waived
 any claim for such additional time. The contractor's plea that insufficient
 time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time. If the
 engineer finds that the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the
 control and without the fault of the contractor, the engineer may extend the
 contract time in such amount as conditions justify.
 Upon satisfactory final inspection, daily time charges will cease.
 108.07.1 Working Day Contracts: On working day contracts, a
 working day will be charged when weather or other conditions not under
 the control of the contractor will permit construction operations to proceed
 for at least 5 continuous hours of the day or 65 percent of the normal work
 day, whichever is greater, with the normal working force engaged in
 performing the controlling item of work.
 Should the contractor prepare to begin work on any day in which
 inclement weather, or the conditions resulting from the weather, prevent
 work from beginning at the usual starting time, and the crew is dismissed
 as a result, the contractor will not be charged for a working day whether or
 not conditions change during the day and the rest of the day becomes
 suitable for work.
 No working days will be charged for the following days:
 1. Saturdays and Sundays when no work is performed.
 2. State recognized holidays that are defined as regular legal
 holidays or special holidays that are proclaimed by the Governor or fixed
 by the Legislature on which no work is performed.
 3. Days on which delays, attributable solely to the Department or
 other governmental agencies, prevent contractor from proceeding with the
 controlling item of work at time of delay.
 4. Days on which delays are attributable to the direct effect of
 strikes, riots or civil commotions.
 When the contract time is on a working day basis, the engineer will
 furnish the contractor a monthly statement showing the number of days
 charged to the contract for the preceding month and the number of days
 specified for completion of the contract. The contractor will be allowed 14
 calendar days in which to file a written protest setting forth in what respect
 said monthly statement is incorrect; otherwise, the contractor hereby agrees
 to abide by the monthly statement and shall be deemed under the contract
 94
 
 to have waived any claim that the monthly statement is incorrect.
 If a protest is filed by the contractor, the Department will conduct such
 reviews and investigations as required to rule on the protest within 30
 calendar days from the date the statement is furnished the contractor. The
 number of days charged as listed, or revised within the allotted time, shall
 become final at the end of this 30-day period, subject to change only
 through the claims process.
 108.07.2 Calendar Day Contracts: When the contract time is on a
 calendar day basis, it shall consist of the number of calendar days stated in
 the contract beginning with the date stipulated in the Notice to Proceed. All
 calendar days will be charged contract time, including days elapsing
 between the effective dates of written orders to suspend work and to
 resume work for suspensions not the fault of the contractor. Contract time
 extensions will be granted for any delays for which the Department is
 responsible.
 108.07.3 Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays: Excusable
 non-compensable delays are delays that are not the contractor’s or the
 Department’s fault or responsibility. The engineer will not grant additional
 payment for excusable, non-compensable delays, but will grant additional
 contract time.
 108.07.4 Excusable, Compensable Delays: Excusable,
 compensable delays are delays that are not the contractor’s fault or
 responsibility, but are the Department’s fault or responsibility or
 determined by judicial proceeding to be the Department’s sole
 responsibility or are the fault and responsibility of a local government. The
 contractor will be granted additional contract time and payment in
 accordance with 104.02, 105.18, and 109.04.
 108.07.5 Non-Excusable Delays: Non-excusable delays are delays
 that are the contractor’s fault or responsibility. All non-excusable delays
 are non-compensable.
 108.07.6 Concurrent Delays: Concurrent delays are separate
 critical delays that occur at the same time. When a non-compensable delay
 is concurrent with a compensable delay, the contractor is entitled to
 additional time but not additional payment.
 108.08 FAILURE TO COMPLETE ON TIME. For each calendar day
 including, but not limited to, adverse weather days and holidays that the
 work remains incomplete after expiration of the contract time, the sum
 specified in Table 108-1 will be deducted from payments for the work, not
 as a penalty but as stipulated damages, except for days DOTD directs in
 95
 
 writing as no work days.
 Permitting the contractor to continue work after expiration of the
 contract time will not operate as a waiver by the Department of its rights
 under the contract. Contractor accepts, expressly assents, and does hereby
 confess judgment in favor of DOTD as to the daily charge amount set forth
 in Table 108-1.
 Stipulated damages will be determined by the project’s Original
 Contract Amount and the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for the project’s
 location. The ADT will be the traffic count as shown on the plans and the
 Original Contract Amount will be equal to the bid amount. The sum of
 Daily Charges (A) and (B) shown in Table 108-1 will be the assessed daily
 stipulated damages for each calendar day after expiration of the contract
 time.

 The contractor will automatically be subject to an assessment of
 stipulated damages by the expiration of contract time on the project. At
 any time stipulated damages are assessed, such damages shall be assessed
 continuously until the cause of such assessment ends, regardless of
 intervening circumstances.
 96
 
 The amount of assessed stipulated damages will be deducted from
 payments for the work under the contract or from any payments on any
 other contract the contractor has with the Department. The contractor
 hereby waives any requirement of written notice of default prior to any
 deduction for stipulated damages from any payments. The contractor and
 the surety shall be solidarily liable for stipulated damages in excess of any
 remaining amounts due the contractor under the contract.
 108.09 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT. The contractor shall be in default,
 if the contractor:
 1. Fails to complete the project within the contract time,
 2. Becomes insolvent or a petition is filed in the Bankruptcy Courts of
 the United States under Chapters 7 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code naming
 the contractor as debtor or conversion of a proceeding or petition from
 Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code or seeks a forced
 respite under the laws of this State or similar debtor protection by courts of
 other states,
 3. Allows any final judgment to stand unsatisfied for a period of 14
 calendar days,
 4. Makes an assignment or arranges for performance by others of all
 or part of the performance of the contract, other than by subletting pursuant
 to 108.01, without written approval and consent in advance of the
 Department, and the surety in the case of an assignment of the entire
 contract,
 5. Makes an assignment of contract proceeds for the benefit of one or
 more creditors without prior written approval and consent of the
 Department; any such purported assignment will not be honored without
 evidence of compliance with this subparagraph,
 6. Discontinues prosecution of the work,
 7. Fails to begin work within 10 calendar days of either the “Notice to
 Proceed” or end of the Assembly Period,
 8. Fails to perform with sufficient workers, equipment, or materials to
 assure prompt completion of the work,
 9. Performs the work unsuitably or neglects or refuses to remove
 materials, or replace or repair rejected work,
 10. Fails to resume discontinued or suspended work within 10 calendar
 days after notice to do so,
 11. Fails to maintain licenses or certifications, or to acquire permits,
 necessary to accomplish the work;
 12. Fails to perform the work in an acceptable manner, violates any
 97
 
 provision in the contract, or fails to follow any federal, state or local laws
 pertaining to performance,
 13. Fails to follow federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations
 concerning construction safety and health standards or permits conditions
 upon the site of the work which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to
 the health or safety of the contractor's workmen or the public, or
 14. Is a party to fraud.
 When one or more of these default events occur and circumstances
 warrant, the Department may give notice to the contractor of its intent to
 put the contractor in default under this subsection and specify a period of
 time in which the contractor shall cure the deficiency.
 If circumstances do not warrant an opportunity to cure, or in the event
 the contractor fails to timely cure a default after notice, the Department will
 give written notice to the contractor, with a copy to the contractor's surety,
 of the Department's determination that the contractor is in default for any
 cause specified in this subsection and direct the surety to complete the
 work. Such notice removes the contractor’s right to proceed with the work
 and suspends payments to the contractor. Within thirty days of receipt of
 such notification, the surety shall present to the Department either a plan to
 assume performance of the contract and procure completion of the project,
 or provide the Department in writing with a reasonable response for the
 contractor's default. A response that fails to procure completion of the
 project shall not release the surety of its obligations under the performance
 bond as provided in the following paragraph.
 If no completion plan is timely presented by the surety, or at any time if
 immediate action must be taken in the public interest or to protect the
 safety of the public or workers, the Department will take prosecution of the
 work out of the hands of the contractor or surety, may appropriate or use
 the materials and/or equipment on the project, or may enter into an
 agreement for completion of the contract or use other methods as required
 for completion of the contract in an acceptable manner. The surety shall
 then be responsible for payment to the Department of the cost of
 completion of the project and stipulated damages assessed by the public
 entity up to the total amount of the bond. If the surety has not timely
 completed the project and a court of competent jurisdiction has determined
 that the surety has unreasonably refused to take over the project, the surety
 shall be responsible for the payment of any stipulated damages for any
 delay in completion of the project as specified in the original contract and
 any reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the Department
 in collection of payments required by this subsection.
 98
 
 Nothing herein shall be construed to require or obligate the Department
 to suspend contract time or to release the obligation of the contractor and
 surety for stipulated damages in accordance with 108.08.
 The costs incurred by the Department due to the contractor's default,
 including attorney's fees, or for completing the work under contract, will be
 deducted from any monies due or which may become due the contractor.
 When this expense exceeds the sum which would have been payable under
 the contract, the contractor and surety shall be liable and shall pay the
 Department the amount of such excess.
 108.10 TERMINATION OF CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.
 The contract will be considered complete when all work has been
 satisfactorily completed, the final inspection made, and the work accepted
 by the DOTD Chief Engineer. The contractor will then be released from
 further obligation except as set forth in the contractor's
 payment/performance/ retainage bonds, 104.05, 107.17, 107.23, or as
 otherwise provided.
 108.11 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT. The Department may, by
 written notice, terminate the contract or any portion thereof when, for
 reasons beyond either the Department's or contractor's control, the
 contractor is prevented from proceeding or completing the work as
 originally contracted, or when termination would be in the public interest.
 Such reasons for termination may include, but will not be limited to:
 1. Executive orders of the President relating to prosecution of war or
 national defense;
 2. National emergency which creates a serious shortage of materials;
 3. Orders from duly constituted authorities relating to energy
 conservation; and
 4. Restraining orders or injunctions obtained by third-party citizen
 action resulting from national or local environmental protection laws or
 where the issuance of such order or injunction is primarily caused by acts
 or omissions of persons or agencies other than the contractor.
 When a contract, or a portion thereof, is terminated before completion
 of all items of work in the contract, payment will be made for the number
 of units or items of work completed at the contract unit price, or as
 mutually agreed for items of work partially completed or not started. No
 claim for loss of anticipated profits will be considered.
 Reimbursement for organization of the work, and other overhead
 expenses (when not otherwise included in the contract), and moving
 99
 
 equipment and materials to and from the project will be considered.
 Acceptable materials obtained or ordered by the contractor for the work
 that are not incorporated in the work shall, at the option of the contractor,
 be purchased by the Department at actual cost as shown by receipted bills
 and actual cost records at such points of delivery as designated.
 Termination of a contract or a portion, thereof, shall not relieve the
 contractor of responsibility for the completed work, nor shall it relieve the
 surety of obligation for any just claim arising from the work performed.
 108.12 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT FOR CONVENIENCE. The
 Department may, by written notice, terminate the contract or any portion
 thereof for the Department's convenience and without cause. Upon receipt
 of written notice from the Department of such termination, the contractor
 shall cease operations as directed by the Department in the notice and
 complete work not terminated; take actions necessary, or those that the
 Department may direct, for the protection and preservation of the Work;
 place no further subcontracts or order materials, services, or facilities,
 except as approved by the Department to complete any remaining portion
 of the contract; terminate all existing subcontracts and purchase orders to
 the extent they relate to terminated work; deliver to the Department any
 unfabricated or partially fabricated parts, work in progress, completed
 work, supplies, and other material produced or acquired for the work
 terminated; coordinate a time and date with the engineer to inventory
 materials obtained but not yet used for the project; deliver all completed or
 partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other property
 required to be furnished to the Department if the contract had been
 completed.
 In case of such termination for the Department’s convenience, the
 contractor shall be entitled to receive payment for (1) the quantity of units
 or items of work completed at the contract unit price, and, as mutually
 agreed, for items of work partially completed, and (2) reasonable direct
 labor costs and non-labor cash expenditures incurred for unplanned
 termination related activities described above.
 The Department will not be liable for destroyed, stolen, or damaged
 material; unliquidated advance or other payments to third parties under the
 terminated portion of the contract; or the agreed upon price or the proceeds
 from the sale of any materials, supplies, or other items acquired and sold,
 or retained, by the contractor. In addition, the Department will deduct from
 any termination payment any claim the Department has against the
 contractor under the Contract.
 100
 
 Acceptable materials obtained or ordered by the contractor for the work
 that are not incorporated in the work shall, at the option of the contractor,
 be purchased by the Department at actual cost as shown by receipted bills
 and actual cost records at such points of delivery as designated.
 Termination of a contract or a portion thereof, shall not relieve the
 contractor of responsibility for the work completed, nor shall it relieve the
 surety of any obligation for any just claim arising from the work
 performed.
 
 101
 
 Section 109
 Measurement and Payment
 109.01 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES. All work completed
 under the contract will be measured according to United States standard
 measure. The International System of Units, generally known as SI or
 metric units will be used only if quality control or acceptance testing must
 be conducted under those standards. Standard practice used in these
 specifications will be to show values in the United States standard measure
 units, except for Part X, Materials, where both systems of measure are
 shown. Applicable units of measure will be defined in the table or figure
 titles. The terms weight and mass can be used interchangeably in these
 specifications if SI units are used.
 The engineer shall be the judge of the accuracy of measurements, or
 approximations made in lieu of accurate determinations and these decisions
 shall be binding upon both parties.
 When project specifications or plans indicate that quantities for certain
 pay items have been computed with sufficient accuracy for payment, the
 pay quantities for those items will be the design quantities subject to the
 following adjustments. Design quantities will be adjusted if the engineer
 makes changes to fit field conditions, if plan errors are proven, or if design
 changes are necessary.
 When measurement of excavation and embankment is based on a cubic
 yard, the design quantities will be verified or revised in accordance with
 Departmental policy.
 Longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made
 horizontally. Transverse measurements for area computations will be the
 neat dimensions shown on the plans or ordered in writing.
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans
 or as directed.
 Items measured by the linear foot, such as pipe culverts, underdrains,
 etc., will be measured parallel to the foundation upon which such structures
 are placed.
 In computing volumes of excavation, the average end area method or
 other acceptable methods will be used.
 Thickness of plates and galvanized sheet metal used in the manufacture
 of corrugated metal pipe and metal plate pipe culverts and arches will be
 measured in decimal fractions of inches.
 When United States standard units are used, the pound or the ton will be
 102
 
 the standard units of weight. The term “ton,” in the United States standard,
 will mean the short ton of 2,000 pounds avoirdupois. Materials measured
 or proportioned by weight shall be weighed on approved scales by
 qualified personnel at designated locations. If material is shipped by rail,
 the car weight may be accepted provided the weight of material only will
 be paid for; however, car weights will not be acceptable for material to be
 passed through mixing plants. Trucks used to haul material being paid by
 measured weight shall be weighed empty at such times as directed; and
 each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
 Materials specified to be measured by volume in hauling vehicles shall
 be hauled in approved vehicles and will be measured therein at the point of
 delivery on the project. Vehicles may be of any acceptable size or type,
 provided the body is of such shape that the volume can be readily and
 accurately determined. Vehicles shall be loaded to at least a predetermined
 permanently fixed mark, which defines a known volume, upon arrival at
 the point of delivery. Vehicles will be measured in increments of 0.5 cubic
 yard, except that when tailgate spreader boxes are used to place aggregate
 materials for asphalt surface treatment, the volume of the spreader box will
 be added to the volume of the vehicle. When materials are measured by
 weight and converted to volume for payment, conversion will be made to
 the nearest 0.1 cubic yard.
 Asphalt materials will be measured by the gallon or by the ton. When
 specified, volumes of liquid asphalt materials will be converted to gallons
 at 60°F (liters at 15°C) in accordance with DOTD TR 321.
 Net certified scale weights or weights based on certified volumes (in the
 case of shipments by rail, truck or other transport) will be used as a basis of
 measurement, subject to correction when material has been lost in transit,
 wasted or otherwise not incorporated in the work.
 When asphalt materials are shipped by truck or transport, net certified
 weights or volume, subject to correction for loss or foaming, may be used
 for computing quantities. Portland cement will be measured by the ton.
 Timber will be measured by the thousand feet board measure (MFBM)
 incorporated in the structure. Measurement will be based on nominal
 widths and thicknesses and the length of each piece.
 The terms “lump sum, each, or unit” when used as a unit of measure for
 payment will mean complete payment for the work described in the
 contract.
 When a complete structure or structural unit is specified as the unit of
 measurement, the unit of measurement will include the necessary fittings
 and accessories. Incidental work associated with the structure or structural
 103
 
 unit will not be measured for payment.
 When standard manufactured items are specified, and these items are
 identified by gage, unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such identification
 will be considered to be nominal weights or dimensions. Unless more
 stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications, manufacturing
 tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted.
 When conversion is necessary from United States standard units to
 International System of Units (SI units) or from SI units to U. S. Standard
 units the guidelines, terminology, conversion factors, and rules for
 rounding in the Standard Metric Practice Guide, AASHTO R1 will be used.
 109.02 SCOPE OF PAYMENT. The contractor shall receive and accept
 compensation as provided in the contract as full payment for furnishing
 materials and for performing work in an acceptable manner and for all risk,
 loss, damage or expense arising out of prosecution of the work, subject to
 the provisions of 107.23, 108.08, and 108.09. All work on Pay Items must
 be subject to inspection by Department personnel. Any work performed
 without being subject to inspection by Department personnel may not be
 measured or paid.
 Contractor accepts the summation of the product of the unit prices bid
 on the schedule of items, or as altered by change order, multiplied by the
 actual quantity placed or performed for each such item per its unit measure,
 as audited by DOTD, as full, complete, and final compensation under the
 contract for all work, labor, materials, and other direct costs; indirect
 expenses and overhead; and any attained profit. Only those quantities for
 each item necessary to complete the project, as adjusted by any change
 orders approved by the DOTD Chief Engineer or designee, will be
 compensated.
 When the “Payment” clause in the specifications relating to any unit
 price in the Schedule of Items requires that the said unit price be
 considered compensation for certain work, such work will not be measured
 nor payment made under any other pay item.
 109.03 COMPENSATION FOR ALTERED QUANTITIES. When
 contract quantities are altered in accordance with 104.02, or when final
 quantities vary for other reasons from the quantities in the Schedule of
 Items, the contractor shall accept as payment in full, payment at the
 contract unit prices for the accepted quantities of work done. No
 allowance, except as provided hereinafter, will be made for any increased
 expense, loss of expected reimbursement or loss of anticipated profits
 104
 
 claimed by the contractor resulting either directly from such alterations or
 indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the pay item expenses of the
 contractor for labor, materials, equipment, subcontractor costs, profits and
 overhead and subsequent loss of expected reimbursements therefor or for
 other cause.
 When alterations of quantities are caused by alteration in the plans, and
 such alterations affect the methods or sequence of construction, an
 allowance will be made, either for or against the contractor, in such
 amounts and basis as agreed to in advance of the performance of the work.
 The change order authorizing or ordering the work shall show how the
 allowance was derived. Except when otherwise authorized by the Chief
 Engineer, such derivation shall show, as a minimum, breakdown of costs as
 detailed in 109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.7, except that projected costs rather
 than actual costs will be used, along with the mark-up provided in 109.04,
 as full and final compensation for all related jobsite and home office
 overhead, and any profit.
 When alterations in quantities result in an increase or decrease of more
 than 25 percent in the contract quantity as awarded on any “Major Item” of
 the contract, a supplemental agreement to the contract may be executed
 between the Department and the contractor at the request of either party,
 prior to performance of any work in excess of 25 percent of the contract
 quantity. A “Major Item” is an item included in the contract as awarded
 with a total cost equal to or greater than 10 percent of the original total
 contract amount.
 Any adjustment in unit price will be made on only that portion of the
 Major Item exceeding 125 percent of the original item quantity. In the case
 of a decrease of a Major Item by 25 percent or more, the entire remaining
 portion of the item quantity will be adjusted. The actual costs shall be
 itemized in accordance with 109.04.03.1 through 109.04.3.7, except that
 projected costs may be used in case of an increase in quantity. When a
 supplemental agreement or change order is executed for an adjustment in
 unit price, the consent of the contractor's surety shall be obtained by the
 contractor and furnished to the engineer.
 A “Minor Item” is an item included in the contract as awarded with a
 total cost of less than 10 percent of the original total contract amount. A
 minor item shall become a major item if it is increased by such an amount
 that its total cost is equal to or greater than 10 percent of the original total
 contract amount. If a minor item is increased to the extent that it becomes a
 major item, only that part of the item that exceeds 12.5 percent of the
 original total contract amount will be considered on any change order
 105
 
 and/or special agreement. The agreement shall be executed prior to
 performance of any work in excess of 12.5 percent of the contract amount.
 The requirements of the special agreement shall be as described above for
 increases in major items. Except as provided in this paragraph, if a minor
 item is increased or decreased, no adjustment will be made in its unit price.
 109.04 COMPENSATION FOR ALTERATIONS OF THE
 CONTRACT. Payment for work performed in accordance with 104.02
 and 105.19 will first be made at the contract’s established unit prices. If
 unit prices are not applicable, the second basis of payment will be
 negotiated prices agreed to by change order prior to the start of the work. If
 an acceptable negotiated price cannot be established prior to the work
 being performed, the Department may require the contractor to perform the
 work on a “force account” basis.
 109.04.1 Unit Prices: When payments are made at the contract’s
 established unit prices, and the work requires a material change in
 construction method or sequence, adjustment to the unit prices for or
 against the contractor shall be made in accordance with 104.02 and 109.03.
 109.04.2. Negotiated Prices: The Department’s objective is to
 compensate the contractor using the same pricing formulas established by
 the contractor in determining the original bid contract prices. Therefore,
 reasonable rates for labor burden, company owned equipment internal cost
 recovery rates, jobsite overhead items and rates, home office overhead and
 profit mark-up on direct costs, and other pricing components established by
 the contractor at the time the original contract bid prices were determined
 will also be used in determining the negotiated prices for the change order
 work. The change order authorizing the work shall include a detail cost
 breakdown showing direct labor, materials, equipment, and subcontractor
 costs, as well as each of the pricing components listed above.
 In order to facilitate the identification of the original contract bid prices
 and the detailed cost breakdown used in bid preparation, the contractor is
 encouraged to place their original bid estimate preparation documents,
 working papers, and notes in “escrow” upon executing the awarded
 contract and provide the Department proof of such placement in
 accordance with 103.06. If this action is undertaken, the contractor is
 required to prepare the “Summary of Key Bid Pricing Formula Elements”
 form, which is to be included with the escrowed bid estimate work papers
 and notes as its first summary document. When the contractor and the
 Department choose to utilize Negotiated Prices to resolve change order
 amounts for extra work, claims for additional compensation, or other
 106
 
 contract price modifications, the escrowed documents and information will
 be open to department review to verify the original bid estimate pricing
 formulas and information, and then used to price the change order. The
 specific escrow procedures, documents to be escrowed, and the “Summary
 of Key Bid Pricing Formula Elements” form shall conform with the
 requirements of the Department.
 109.04.3. Force Account: When “force account” is the method of
 payment, the contractor shall be paid the direct cost of the work as
 determined and documented in 109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.7 below.
 Jobsite and home office overhead indirect expenses, and profit for all
 parties shall be considered fully compensated by a 15 percent mark-up on
 allowable direct cost items described in109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.4
 below, and the mark-up on direct cost for the subcontractor and contractor
 described in 109.04.3.5 below. The Department may consider additional
 reimbursement to the contractor for indirect fixed jobsite overhead costs for
 excusable compensable delays as defined in 108.07.4 when the change
 order results in extension of the project’s critical work path and the 15
 percent mark-up on direct costs is deemed by the Department to be
 insufficient.
 109.04.3.1 Direct Labor: For labor and working foremen in
 direct charge of operations, the contractor shall receive the wage rates
 agreed on in writing before beginning work for each hour that said labor
 and foremen are engaged in such work. Jobsite and home office
 supervisory personnel shall not be included as direct labor.
 The contractor shall receive the actual costs paid to, or in behalf of,
 workers for subsistence and travel allowances, health and welfare benefits,
 pension fund benefits or other benefits when such amounts are required by
 collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract applicable to
 the classes of labor employed on the work, but limited to a maximum daily
 rate for subsistence and travel allowances. This maximum shall be agreed
 upon prior to the contractor incurring such charges.
 109.04.3.2 Direct Materials: For materials accepted by the
 engineer and used, the contractor shall receive the actual cost of such
 materials delivered to the work, including transportation charges and sales
 taxes if applicable.
 109.04.3.3 Equipment: For authorized machinery or special
 equipment the contractor shall receive the rental rates agreed on in writing
 before such work is begun. For equipment rented from independent
 outside sources, the contractor will be reimbursed the reasonable actual
 cost as shown on paid rental invoices. For company owned equipment, the
 107
 
 contractor will be reimbursed his internal cost recovery equipment charge
 rate consistent with his original bid cost estimates. The Department's
 Engineering Directives and Standards Manual, EDSM III.1.1.27, entitled
 Equipment Rental Rates, provides additional guidance concerning
 allowable equipment rental rates and their application. If the contractor
 chooses to use a rental rate guide book instead of his internal cost recovery
 rates to establish rental rates for company owned equipment, adjustments
 to the allowable type of equipment and hours per day must be made as
 described in the EDSM. In addition, no 15 percent mark-up on equipment
 direct cost for jobsite and home office overhead expenses and profit will be
 allowed if the contractor chooses to use rental rate guide book prices
 instead of his internal cost recovery rates.
 109.04.3.4 Bond, Insurance and Tax: For property damage,
 liability and workmen's compensation insurance premiums, unemployment
 insurance contributions, social security taxes, and bond costs on force
 account work, the contractor shall receive the actual cost thereof. The
 contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rates paid for such
 bond, insurance and tax.
 109.04.3.5 Subcontractor Costs: For change order work
 performed by an approved subcontractor, the subcontractor shall receive
 the subcontractor’s actual and reasonable allowable direct cost of such
 work as described in 109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.4 above plus a 15 percent
 mark-up for the subcontractor’s indirect jobsite and home office overhead
 expenses and profit. In addition, the contractor will be paid a 10 percent
 mark-up on the subcontractor’s total direct and indirect costs, and profit for
 general supervision and sequencing of the change order work.
 109.04.3.6 Non-allowable Costs: No additional contractor cost
 reimbursement will be made for general superintendence, small tools or
 craft specific tool allowances, or other direct or indirect costs not
 specifically included in 109.04.3.1 through 109.04.3.5 above.
 109.04.3.7 Statements: No payment will be made for force
 account work until the contractor has furnished the engineer with duplicate
 itemized statements of the cost of such work detailed as follows:
 1. Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and
 extension for each laborer and foreman.
 2. Designations, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate, and
 extension for each unit of machinery and equipment.
 3. Quantities of materials, prices, and extensions.
 4. Transportation of materials.
 5. Cost of property damage, liability, and workmen's compensation
 108
 
 insurance premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, social
 security taxes, and bond costs.
 The contractor's representative and the engineer shall compare records
 of the cost of work done as ordered on a force account basis. Such
 comparison shall be made daily. Statements shall be accompanied by
 invoices for materials used and transportation charges. If materials used on
 force account work are not purchased for such work, but are taken from the
 contractor's stock, in lieu of invoices, the contractor shall furnish an
 itemized list of such materials showing that the quantity claimed was
 actually used, and that the price and transportation costs claimed represent
 the actual cost to the contractor. Invoices shall be accompanied by the
 contractor's notarized statement that payment in full has been made for the
 materials.
 109.05 PARTIAL PAYMENTS. Provided the work is prosecuted in
 accordance with the provisions of the contract and with satisfactory
 progress, the engineer will make the first progress estimate within 2 months
 from the date indicated to begin work in the Notice to Proceed. The
 Department will determine the progress estimate date. Each successive
 progress estimate will be made on this same date of each month thereafter
 until completion of the contract. Each progress estimate will be an
 approximation of the value of work performed up to the date the estimate is
 made. Prior to the progress estimate date the contractor will be allowed to
 review the progress estimate with the engineer.
 Monthly estimates will be approximate and subject to correction in
 subsequent estimates.
 If an election has been made to have retainage withheld from contract
 payments due the contractor in accordance with 103.05, the Department
 will deduct from the monthly payment estimate an amount equal to five
 percent of the monthly payment estimate. In addition should defective
 work or material be discovered or reasonable doubt arise as to the integrity
 of any part of the work prior to final acceptance and payment, an amount
 will be deducted from subsequent estimates equal in value to the defective
 or questioned work. Payment for this work will not be included in
 subsequent estimates until defects have been remedied or causes for doubt
 removed.
 Payment of the monthly estimate shall not be taken as an admission that
 the work is done or that its quality is satisfactory, nor as a release of the
 contractor from the responsibility for any portion thereof, but the whole
 work and all particulars relating thereto shall be subject to revision and
 109
 
 adjustment by the engineer at the time of final acceptance, or at any time
 thereafter pursuant to contract provisions including, but not limited to, the
 Department’s audit of the project.
 109.06 PAYMENT FOR STOCKPILED OR STORED MATERIAL.
 109.06.1 General: Payment for stockpiled or stored material will be
 considered only for materials anticipated to be stored for periods in excess
 of 30 calendar days. When approved, advance payments may be made for
 fabricated or natural materials that are to be incorporated in the project
 when stockpiled materials are stored on the project or in a dedicated
 stockpile at an approved site outside the limits of the project within the
 State of Louisiana. Payments shall be limited to durable materials
 described herein and shall represent a significant portion of the project cost.
 Perishable articles and small warehouse items are not included. These
 materials shall meet the requirements of the specifications. Payment for
 stockpiled or stored materials will not constitute acceptance. It shall be the
 contractor's responsibility to protect the material from damage while in
 storage.
 Payment for materials stored outside the State of Louisiana will be
 considered, subject to approval of the Chief Engineer. This will generally
 be limited to adjacent states, except in cases where it will be in the best
 interest of the Department to pay for these materials. If payment for
 stockpiled materials outside the State will affect the bid price for an item,
 the contractor shall submit a written request to the Chief Engineer prior to
 bidding.
 Payment may be made for the invoice price for the materials, which
 shall not exceed 85 percent of the contract price for the items where the
 materials are to be incorporated. For fabricated materials purchased from
 commercial sources and delivered to approved storage, partial payment
 may be the invoice price plus freight and taxes. The quantity of material
 for payment will not exceed the total estimated quantity required to
 complete the project.
 The amounts advanced on stockpiled or stored materials will be
 recovered by the Department through deductions made on payments as the
 materials are incorporated in the work.
 Partial payment for stockpiled materials shall be requested by the
 contractor in writing and the following documents shall be furnished:
 1. A copy of the invoices from supplier or manufacturer verifying the
 cost and quantity of material.
 2. If storage is on private property, a copy of the lease or agreement
 110
 
 granting the Department right of entry to property.
 Within 30 calendar days after payment by the Department, the contractor
 shall submit a certified copy of invoices from the supplier for each item for
 which payment has been made. All such invoices submitted shall state the
 amount received by the supplier as payment in full for the materials. If this
 certification of payment is not presented within the 30-day period, the
 advanced payment will be deducted from future progress payments.
 Title and ownership of materials for which advancements have been
 made by the Department shall not vest in the Department until such
 materials are incorporated in the work and the work accepted by the
 Department. The making of advancements by the Department shall not
 release the contractor from the responsibility for any portion thereof.
 109.06.2 Fabricated or Manufactured Materials: Fabricated or
 manufactured materials may include but is not limited to the following:
 Structural steel, fabricated structural steel items, steel piling; reinforcing
 steel; electrical equipment; mechanical equipment; precast concrete
 items; structural timber; timber piling; fencing and guard rail materials;
 fabricated sign structures and sign panels.
 109.06.3 Other Material: These materials will normally be large
 quantities of natural or manufactured aggregate. The contractor's request
 for payment of stockpiled natural material shall give a detailed description
 of the material, its intended use and location of the site. This material will
 be inspected and approved after placement in stockpiles on the project.
 Approval of the stockpiled material will be in writing.
 109.07 ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN COMMON CARRIER
 RATES. It is agreed that the accepted proposal for the work is based on
 common carrier rates on file with the Surface Transportation Board (STB)
 or with a corresponding intrastate commission or body in effect on the date
 of opening of bids. Payments to the contractor will be adjusted upon
 request to compensate for increases in cost due to changes in common
 carrier rates becoming effective after the date of opening of bids and before
 expiration of the contract time. The adjustment shall be limited to an
 amount determined as follows.
 The adjustment shall be the product of the increase in common carrier
 rates multiplied by the net quantity of material shipped at the new rates to

 or landfill, will be included in the bid price for removal or relocation of the
 structure. When a structure is determined to have steel members protected
 by paint containing lead or other hazardous materials, or creosoted timber or
 lumber, and it has not been identified on the plans as such, payment for
 removal and transport of the members to a licensed recycling center or
 landfill will be made in accordance with 109.04. Unless otherwise directed
 or shown on the plans, the contractor will be allowed to retain any steel
 member once the lead paint has been removed and disposed of prior to steel
 leaving the jobsite and a Chain of Custody form or other applicable
 documentation is submitted to the engineer within 21 calendar days.
 When the plans show that a structure to be removed or relocated contains
 a universal waste, payment for the removal of the universal waste will be
 included in the contract unit price for the removal or relocation of the
 structure, which will also include all equipment, labor, and materials
 required for the removal, storage, and transport of the universal waste in
 accordance with LAC Title 33, Part V, Chapter 38. When a structure to be
 removed or relocated is found to contain a universal waste and it is not
 identified as such on the plans, payment for the removal, storage, and
 transport of such universal waste in accordance with LAC Title 33, Part V,
 Chapter 38 will be made in accordance with 109.04.
 Payment for removal of other regulated materials (ORM) will be as
 designated on the plans.

 established. When specified, supply, install, and monitor settlement plates.
 When contaminated soils or underground tanks are encountered, handling
 shall be in accordance with Section 202. Disposal of material shall be in
 accordance with 202.02.
 The plans may include data regarding the boring and classification of
 existing materials. The Department does not guarantee that individual
 samples are representative of the entire project, and bidders are required to
 study, make interpretations and additional investigations, as necessary, at no
 direct pay. The bidder shall determine the suitability of the on-site soils to
 meet specifications of Section 203.
 The contractor shall comply with 107.09 for work in, over or adjacent to
 navigable waters and wetlands, and shall comply with 107.27 when cultural
 artifacts, historical sites, or archaeological sites are encountered.
 Quality assurance requirements shall be as specified in the latest edition
 of the Department’s publication titled Application of Quality Assurance
 Specifications for Embankment and Base Course.
 Excavated material may be used in accordance with 203.06.
 Temporary erosion control shall be in accordance with Section 204.
 203.02 GENERAL EXCAVATION. General excavation consists of the
 excavation of materials, as required by the plans, except drainage excavation
 and structural excavation. General excavation also includes unsuitable
 material in accordance with 203.04.
 203.03 HYDRAULIC EXCAVATION.
 203.03.1 Drainage Excavation: Drainage excavation includes the
 excavation for drainage beyond the limits of the roadway section. Drainage
 excavation also includes inlet and outlet ditches to structures or roadways;
 changes in or deepening of channels of streams, berm ditches, ditches
 129
 
 parallel or adjacent to the roadway beyond the limits of the roadway section;
 and material excavated from areas under bridges.
 203.03.2 Cleaning Existing Ditches: This item consists of
 excavating and disposing of sediment and vegetative materials from existing
 ditches in order to reestablish flow lines on the existing alignment in
 accordance with plan details and the following. Establishment of ditch
 grades, if necessary for this item, will be the responsibility of the project
 engineer.
 Unless otherwise directed, dispose of material excavated from existing
 ditches in accordance with 202.02.
 203.04 UNSUITABLE MATERIAL. Unsuitable materials are soils
 containing significant amounts of debris or organic matter including stumps,
 roots, logs, and humus, or other materials which will decay or produce
 subsidence, including highly saturated soils, which the engineer determines
 are not satisfactory for use in the embankment or other construction
 purposes. Remove unsuitable materials and dispose of as general
 excavation. Remove unsuitable materials determined to be environmentally
 sensitive and dispose of in accordance with 202.05.
 203.05 BORROW. Borrow is defined as soils required for construction of
 embankments or other portions of the work in excess of soils obtained from
 excavation. Obtain borrow from an approved source and use in accordance
 with 203.06. Make arrangements for obtaining borrow at no direct pay.
 Securing of an exclusive option by a bidder or contractor on borrow areas
 or materials for the work will be considered a violation of Louisiana law and
 will be a basis for rejection of bids or such other action the Department
 deems advisable.
 Notify the engineer in writing a minimum of 30 calendar days in advance
 of contractors borrow operations so that samples may be taken and soil tests
 completed prior to beginning borrow operations. Include in notification:
 boring requests, quality control test results, property owner agreements, and
 other information as required by the Materials Sampling Manual and the
 Application of Quality Assurance Specifications for Embankment and Base
 Course to the District Lab.
 Unless otherwise authorized in writing, locate borrow pits, gravel pits,
 and quarry sites at least 300 feet from the right-of-way.
 When sources of borrow are located adjacent to a stream or river listed
 on the National System of Wild and Scenic Rivers or the Louisiana Natural
 130
 
 and Scenic Rivers System, locate borrow pits and any stockpiled materials
 at least 300 feet from the natural stream or river bank.
 Clear the borrow pit and access to allow access for DOTD boring
 equipment. Survey the borrow area with a base line staked. Furnish both
 the engineer and laboratory with a location plat and borrow pit plat. Do not
 begin borrow operations until materials are approved for use.
 Sampling of soils from open excavations in lieu of borings will be
 allowed provided the open excavations display and allow sampling of each
 soil strata and the excavation is at no cost to the Department.
 203.06 SOIL USAGE. The laboratory will test and classify soil in
 accordance with DOTD TR 423 from samples taken in the original location
 or from designated stockpiles. Soil shall be classified and approved prior to
 its being placed in embankments or other final positions on the project.
 Blending in the pit by approved methods to adjust percent silt or sand will
 be permitted. Do not blend soils that do not meet Liquid Limit or PI
 requirements in order to modify the Liquid Limit or PI. Soils may be treated
 with lime to reduce PI in accordance with 203.06.5.
 Soil properties will be determined by the test methods shown in
 Table 203-1, “Soil Properties.”

 50 percent or greater and also a PI of 10 or less will not be allowed.
 203.06.2 Nonplastic Embankment: Nonplastic embankment shall
 be as specified in 203.09.
 203.06.3 Headers: Headers are that portion of the embankment
 within 500 feet of a bridge end. Construct headers for their full height with
 usable soils meeting the requirements of 203.06.1, and having a minimum
 PI of 11, a maximum PI of 25, and a maximum silt content of 65 percent.
 131
 
 No lime treatment to the soil to meet the PI requirements will be permitted.
 Compact headers to 98 percent of maximum dry density in accordance with
 203.07.
 203.06.4 Embankments other than Headers:
 Construct
 embankments with usable soils meeting the requirements of 203.06.1. Soil
 with a PI greater than 25 and less than 35 will be permitted when treated with
 a minimum of 6 percent lime, by volume, provided the organic content and
 silt requirements given in 203.06.1 are met. If lime treatment is used, it will
 be at no direct pay. Lime treatment shall be Type E Treatment conforming
 to Section 304.
 The contractor may request in writing that usable soils for temporary
 detour roads have a PI not to exceed 45 and a maximum silt content of
 75 percent provided:
 1. This material will be removed and not become part of the
 permanent embankment, and
 2. The contractor agrees to take responsibility for any additional
 maintenance required.
 203.06.5 Plastic Soil for Slopes:
 203.06.5.1 Use Topsoil in Accordance with Section 715
 Embankment Material: The outside layer of embankment (fill sections)
 will consist of a plastic soil blanket in accordance with 203.10.
 203.06.5.2 Cut Slopes, PI Less than 10: When soils having a
 PI less than 10 exist on cut slopes, undercut 12 inches and place a plastic soil
 blanket conforming to 203.10.
 203.06.5.3 Cut Slopes, PI 10 or Greater: When soils having a
 PI of 10 or greater but with a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 8.5 exist on cut
 slopes, undercut and place a plastic soil blanket complying with 203.10. In
 lieu of furnishing a plastic soil blanket, the soil may be modified in place so
 that the pH of the soil complies with the requirements of 203.10, at the option
 of the engineer and concurrence of the contractor. In such case, payment
 will be in accordance with existing items or 109.04, as applicable, not to
 exceed the cost of undercut and replacement.
 203.06.6 Usable Soils for Slope Adjustments and Shoulder
 Widening: When the thickness of embankment material used for slope
 adjustment or unpaved shoulder is less than 12 inches, a plastic soil
 complying with 203.10 will be required. If the thickness is greater than
 12 inches, the contractor will be allowed to substitute plastic soil for usable
 soil, provided the widening is not directly below a paved shoulder.
 
 132
 
 203.07 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
 203.07.1 General: Excavation and embankment work consists of
 constructing roadway embankments, including preparation of surfaces on
 which they are to be placed; constructing drainage excavation; constructing
 backslopes; constructing dikes, when required; placing and compacting
 approved material in areas where unusable material has been undercut and
 removed; placing and compacting embankment material in holes, pits, and
 other depressions.
 Do not place or spread embankment materials on portland cement
 concrete or asphalt concrete pavements. Do not damage pavement surfaces,
 edges and joints during embankment operations.
 203.07.2 Surface Layer Preparation: Complete all necessary
 clearing and grubbing in an area, prior to beginning excavation, grading, or
 embankment operations in that area. Prior to any embankment operations in
 an area, cut ditches as required to facilitate drainage in that area unless
 otherwise noted on the plans.
 When preparing surface layers on which the embankment or base is to be
 placed, attempt all normal earthwork construction methods before
 undercutting or modifying the soil with additives. Such construction
 methods may include, but are not limited to, the following and will be at no
 direct pay:
 1. Draining and drying of the surface until the material is within the
 limits of optimum moisture before compaction is attempted.
 2. Using lighter weight construction equipment for manipulating,
 disking, drying, and compacting the material.
 3. Placing successive loads of approved material in a uniformly
 distributed layer of a thickness necessary to support equipment while placing
 subsequent layers.
 4. Rerouting heavy construction equipment around the area until the
 embankment can support the equipment without damage to foundation soils.
 Remove unstable materials by undercutting, unless otherwise directed,
 and backfill to required section with usable soils as directed.
 When undercutting is required, conduct the operations in such manner
 that the engineer can make necessary measurements before backfill is placed.
 When a new roadway is to be constructed on an existing roadbed, remove
 existing surface courses. When the surface of the existing roadbed is within
 2 foot of finished sub-grade, scarify the existing roadbed full width to a depth
 of not less than 9 inches and re-compact to at least 95.0 percent of maximum
 dry density.
 133
 
 203.07.3 Excavation: Excavated material shall become the property
 of the contractor. Soils from excavation areas may be used in embankments
 or other finished sections when approved. Dispose of surplus or unusable
 excavated material in accordance with 202.02 or as provided in this
 subsection.
 When obliteration of old roadways is required, include grading operations
 necessary to satisfactorily incorporate the old roadway into the new roadway
 and surroundings to the satisfaction of the engineer and to allow drainage.
 203.07.4 Settlement Plate Installation and Monitoring: Furnish
 and install settlement plate as shown on the plans.
 Install settlement plate prior to placement of any fill. Place settlement
 plate on top of the geotextile fabric if shown on the plans, otherwise, place
 the settlement plate on natural ground. Maintain a vertical and undamaged
 riser pipe during embankment placement and compaction. Replace any
 settlement plate damaged during construction at no cost to the Department.
 Establish the elevation of the settlement plate. Take initial settlement
 plate elevation readings immediately after installation. Unless specified on
 the plans, monitor settlement plate as follows: immediately after the final
 lift placement, twice weekly for the first month, and weekly for five months
 thereafter. Repeat this sequence if any additional fill placement or surcharge
 is required. Record the embankment elevation and surcharge height for each
 settlement plate reading. Submit settlement plate readings to the Project
 Engineer. The Project Engineer will verify the initial and final elevations for
 acceptance.
 Remove riser pipe and casing three feet below base course upon
 acceptance.
 203.07.5 Embankment:
 Embankment material shall be in
 accordance with 203.06. Place in uniform layers not exceeding 12 inches of
 un-compacted thickness. Place each layer for the full width of embankment,
 blend as necessary to obtain a uniform material, bring to a uniform moisture
 content, and compact to a minimum of 95.0 percent of maximum dry density
 before the next layer is placed. Determine maximum dry density in
 accordance with DOTD TR 415 or TR 418 and percent in-place density in
 accordance with DOTD TR 401. The density of the embankment shall be
 such that the density of the type of base course being constructed shall be
 met. The moisture content at the time of compaction, tested in accordance
 with DOTD TR 403, shall be within a range of ±2.0 percent of optimum
 moisture established in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or TR 418. If not,
 reprocess and re-compact the lifts until these requirements are met.
 Topsoil shall be placed and compacted in accordance with 715.03.
 134
 
 Ensure that final embankment slope lines are uniform in appearance.
 Measure as necessary to assure that the elevations at the top, bottom, and
 intermediate breaks in the slope are such that minimum acceptable slopes are
 achieved. Visually inspect the slopes and ensure the slopes are straight
 without valleys or humps. If an apparent discrepancy is discovered upon
 visual inspection, take measurements a minimum of every 10 feet measured
 along the slope between theoretical break points in the embankment.
 Allowable tolerances for slope grade will not be less than by 0.03 foot/foot
 nor greater than 0.15 foot/foot. The slopes shall be reworked until these
 criteria are met. The top of embankment shall not vary from the established
 grade by more than ±0.1 foot.
 Conduct operations to prevent lamination between lifts. Correct all
 laminations between lifts prior to placing additional lifts. Assure that
 surfaces of excavated areas and embankments are smooth and uniform. Do
 not disturb material outside the construction limits.
 When excavation and embankment construction results in surface soils
 having a PI less than 10, or pH less than 5.5 or greater than 8.5, place a plastic
 soil blanket complying with 203.10.
 The contractor shall be responsible for the stability of embankments until
 final acceptance. Construction activities which may lead to subsequent
 embankment damage, will not be permitted.
 When embankments are constructed on a surface sloping more than 6:1
 from the horizontal, cut the slope of the ground on which the embankment is
 to be placed into steps, as directed, before fill is placed.
 When an embankment is to be constructed to a height of less than 5 feet,
 remove heavy sod and objectionable vegetation from the area on which the
 embankment is to be placed. Scarify the area to a depth of approximately
 9 inches. Re-compact this area to at least 95.0 percent of maximum dry
 density in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or TR 418 and percent in-place
 density in accordance with DOTD TR 401. When height of fill is 5 feet or
 more, removal of sod will not be required, but disk the area on which
 embankment is to be placed to the satisfaction of the engineer and recompact before construction of embankment.
 When embankment material is to be deposited only on one side of
 abutments, wing walls, piers, or culvert head walls, do not compact the area
 immediately adjacent to the structure to the extent that it will cause excessive
 pressure against the structure. When the embankment is to be deposited on
 both sides of a concrete wall or similar structure, conduct operations so that
 the embankment is always at approximately the same elevation on both sides
 of the structure. Backfill structures in accordance with Section 802.
 135
 
 When embankments are constructed in lakes, streams, swamps, or other
 unstable areas and unstable material cannot be removed or the area drained,
 the requirement for placing material in layers as outlined above may be
 waived. When this requirement is waived, place the embankment by end
 dump or other approved methods to an elevation where normal construction
 methods can begin. Construct embankments placed above this elevation in
 layers as specified above. When a wave of unsuitable material is forced up
 in front of the end dumping operation, it shall become the property of the
 contractor and be removed as necessary. In addition, do not allow this
 material to be trapped and incorporated in the embankment except as part of
 plastic soil for slopes.
 203.08 CUT AREA PREPARATION. Scarify and compact the top
 12 inches of the cut area to such density that the compaction requirements of
 the type base course being constructed shall be met. Construction,
 compaction, and testing requirements shall comply with 203.07.
 When unstable soils are encountered, the engineer will determine the
 limits to be undercut. Excavate to a stable foundation or to the depth required
 by the engineer and backfill to existing grade. Undercut shall be constructed
 and tested in accordance with 203.07. When a stable foundation cannot be
 reached, “bridge-in” the embankment materials and construct the remaining
 embankment to existing grade in accordance with 203.07.
 203.09 NONPLASTIC EMBANKMENT.
 203.09.1 Materials: Non-plastic embankment material shall comply
 with 1003.09 or the following, unless otherwise specified on the plans.
 203.09.2 General Requirements: Do not entrap unsuitable material
 defined in 203.04 in the embankment. Remove any such material at no direct
 pay.
 Leave surcharge materials on the embankment for at least the specified
 number of days after approval of the increment. Damage to embankment
 increments due to the contractor’s operations shall be satisfactorily repaired
 by the contractor at no direct pay. Remove excess surcharge materials after
 the surcharge period. Verification cross-sections of the final embankment
 will be taken after removal of the surcharge. Material required due to
 additional subsidence after cross-sections are taken will be paid under the
 appropriate item.
 After all embankment increments have been surcharged, satisfactorily
 dispose of excess surcharge material in accordance with 202.02 at no direct
 pay.
 136
 
 Except for stone embankments, furnish and place a plastic soil blanket
 complying with 203.10.
 203.09.3 Nonplastic Embankment Construction: Construct
 nonplastic embankments by mechanical methods.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, place material in lifts not exceeding
 15 inches of uncompacted thickness after establishing a working table as
 directed. Compact each lift and test in accordance with 203.07.
 203.09.4 Blended
 Calcium
 Sulfate
 Embankment
 Construction: Add water or use other suitable means to prevent dust
 resulting from the transport and placement of dry material. Place blended
 embankment material in lifts not exceeding 12 inches in thickness (loose)
 after establishing a working table as directed. Compact each lift to at least
 95 percent of maximum dry density prior to placement of subsequent lifts.
 Determine the maximum density in accordance with DOTD TR 418
 modified to include a drying temperature not to exceed 140°F. Perform field
 density testing in accordance with 203.07. Determine moisture content for
 density corrections by oven drying the material at 140°F for a minimum of
 24 hours. Provide a forced draft type oven capable of maintaining this
 temperature. Also, furnish and place a plastic soil blanket complying with
 203.10.
 Do not place blended calcium sulfate within 10 feet of metal drainage
 structures. The contractor will be allowed to substitute natural stone,
 flowable fill under Section 710, or other material in 1003.08 as approved by
 the Department.
 203.10 PLASTIC SOIL BLANKET. Plastic soil blanket shall consist of
 soils having a minimum PI of 11, maximum PI of 35, a maximum silt content
 of 65 percent, and a pH not less than 5.5 or greater than 8.5, and a minimum
 organic content of 3 percent. The contractor will be allowed to blend organic
 materials to achieve the minimum 3 percent organic content. The plastic soil
 blanket shall support a satisfactory stand of grass in accordance with
 Sections 714 or 717. Construct the soil blanket to a minimum thickness of
 12 inches. Areas requiring a plastic soil blanket shall be approved prior to
 placement of the plastic soil blanket. After materials are placed and spread,
 remove lumps, stones, roots and other foreign matter from the area. Spread
 and roll soil blanket material in a manner that leaves a uniform surface.
 Ensure that any remaining ridges or grooves, including cleat tracks from the
 dozer, will be parallel to the roadway during the period of time between
 placement and seeding.
 Place plastic soil blanket in a timely manner to prevent erosion.
 137
 
 203.11 GEOTEXTILE FABRICS.
 203.11.1 General: Furnish and place geotextile fabric in accordance
 with these specifications and in conformance with the details shown on the
 plans.
 203.11.2 Materials:
 The geotextile fabric shall comply with
 Section 1019.
 203.11.3 Construction Requirements: Keep rolls of geotextile
 fabric covered and protected from ultraviolet degradation at all times until
 use. Cover geotextile fabric that has been installed with embankment
 material within seven calendar days. When ultraviolet damage occurs,
 remove and replace the geotextile fabric. Place the geotextile fabric at the
 locations shown on the plans or as directed. Overlap or sew adjacent rolls
 of geotextile fabric. When rolls are overlapped, overlap a minimum of
 18 inches or as specified in the plans, including the ends of the rolls. Place
 the top layer of the geotextile fabric parallel with adjacent rolls and in the
 direction of embankment placement. When rolls are sewn, join adjacent rolls
 by sewing with polyester or kevlar thread. When field sewing, employ the
 J-seam or “Butterfly” seam with the two pieces of geotextile fabric mated
 together, turned inwards so as to sew through four layers of fabric. Sew with
 two rows of Type 401, two-thread chain stitch. Factory seams other than
 specified shall be submitted to the Materials and Testing Section for
 approval. Where the ground is covered with water or soil is saturated,
 sewing of the geotextile fabric will be required.
 Place the geotextile fabric as smooth as possible with no wrinkles or
 folds, except in curved road sections. For curved road sections, fold the
 geotextile fabric to accommodate the curve. The fold shall be in the direction
 of construction and pinned or stapled. Fill and compact ruts that occur
 during construction prior to placement of geotextile fabric.
 Remove damaged geotextile fabric and replace with new geotextile fabric
 or cover with a second layer of geotextile fabric extending 2 feet in each
 direction from the damaged area.
 203.12 QUALITY CONTROL. Locate, select, and place material
 conforming to specification requirements. Control processes, including
 performing tests and making adjustments as necessary, to result in a uniform
 quality product meeting all the requirements of the plans and specifications.
 Perform tests for in-place moisture content in accordance with DOTD
 TR 403, at a frequency that will ensure that the material is within the
 tolerances of optimum moisture. Perform tests for in-place density in
 accordance with DOTD TR 401 at a frequency that will ensure that the
 138
 
 compactive effort is producing a uniform product that conforms to
 specification requirements. Control placement and finishing to ensure
 conformance with the lines, grades, thickness, and typical cross-sections
 shown on the plans or established.
 Sections will be inspected prior to acceptance testing. Correct obviously
 deficient areas prior to acceptance testing.
 203.13 ACCEPTANCE. The Department will perform inspection,
 sampling, and testing for acceptance. Correct any area that is deficient
 whether identified by inspection or testing.
 The embankment (with surcharge, if required) will be approved in
 increments of 1000 feet, except terminal increments which may be less than
 1000 feet.
 Maximum density for earthwork will be determined in accordance with
 DOTD TR 415 or DOTD TR 418; in-place density will be determined in
 accordance with DOTD TR 401.
 203.14 MEASUREMENT.
 203.14.1 General: Unless otherwise specified, borrow material in
 accordance with 203.05, topsoil, and plastic soil for slopes in accordance
 with 203.06.6 will be considered incidental to the embankment and will not
 be measured separately, but will be measured as embankment. Removal and
 stockpiling of existing topsoil will be measured by the in-situ square yard.
 Measurement of undercut will be from subgrade or original ground,
 whichever is lower.
 No measurement will be made for excavation for culverts or culvert
 headwalls.
 When the grade line of a pipe or box culvert is raised or lowered more
 than 2 feet from the grade line shown on the plans or is relocated to a site
 requiring an equivalent change in excavation, payment will be increased or
 decreased accordingly at the rate of three times the contract unit price for
 General Excavation (or Embankment if General Excavation is not a contract
 pay item). The volume to be used in the increase or decrease will be a
 rectangular solid the length of the pipe or box culvert, the outside width of
 the pipe or box culvert plus 3 feet, and the average change in invert elevation
 minus 2 feet.
 203.14.2 General Excavation, Embankment and Nonplastic
 Embankment: The measurement of quantities will be computed by the
 average end area method and will be that area bound by (1) the original
 ground line established by location (plan) cross-sections or new original
 139
 
 cross-sections obtained by the contractor, and (2) the final theoretical pay
 line as shown on the plans, or established by the engineer, adjusted for field
 changes. New original cross-sections will be taken after clearing, and prior
 to grubbing.
 The final theoretical pay line shall be derived from the profile grade,
 typical section and ditch grades shown in the plans, along with approved plan
 changes and other field changes made by the engineer. No increase in
 quantities will be authorized for overbuilding unless directed by the
 engineer.
 Pay lines for surcharged embankments will be the theoretical surcharge
 lines shown on the plans. No measurement will be made for removing and
 disposing of excess surcharge materials.
 When payment is made for embankment in its final position, no
 additional quantity will be measured due to settlement, compaction, erosion
 or other cause.
 Excavation and embankment for crossovers, turnouts, driveway
 approaches or other minor installations will not be included in the
 measurement.
 A depth and width tolerance of ±1.5 feet will be allowed for excavation
 of unsuitable material. Overdepth and overwidth will be waived at no direct
 pay; however, no measurement for payment will be made for additional
 embankment material required to backfill areas beyond theoretical
 unsuitable material lines.
 Measurement will be made by one or more of the following methods:
 203.14.2.1 Plan Quantity: The quantities of excavation and
 embankment will be those shown in the plans, provided the project is
 constructed essentially to the theoretical pay line.
 When the plans have been revised or when disagreement exists between
 the contractor and the engineer as to the accuracy of the plan quantities for
 the entire project, or any substantial portion thereof, either party may require
 that quantities be revised. The party requesting the revision will be
 responsible for isolating and detailing the error in an easily understood
 format which may include cross-sections, sketches, and computations. The
 revision will be verified and agreed to by the other party. Quantity revisions
 will not be considered without advanced notice to both parties and unless the
 original cross-sections have been taken.
 No payment will be made to the contractor to re-compute new plan
 quantities.
 
 140
 
 203.14.2.2 Field Cross-Sections: When payment lines are not
 shown on the plans and cannot be established, in lieu of final theoretical pay
 lines, field cross-sections will be used to determine pay quantities for
 excavation and embankment.
 After clearing operations, the contractor shall take original cross-sections
 for the entire length of the project. Take all original cross-sections in the
 presence of the Department. Take cross-sections at sufficient intervals to
 accurately determine earthwork quantities, not to exceed 100 linear feet.
 Take the cross-sections in accordance with DOTD procedures, and furnish
 results to the Department immediately in a format satisfactory to the
 engineer. The Department reserves the right to take additional cross-sections
 as needed to verify the contractor’s cross-sections. In the event the crosssections do not verify, the contractor shall investigate and reconcile any
 differences.
 The original cross-sections will be used to determine the accuracy of the
 location cross-sections by using random sections not farther apart than
 1000 linear feet and centerline elevations at intervals of 100 linear feet. The
 location cross-sections will be considered to be usable if the average of the
 differentials does not exceed ±0.3 foot. For significant portions of the
 project with obvious errors between location and original cross-sections, the
 contractor’s original field cross-sections will be used, and will not be part of
 the verification process. In all cases where location sections are unavailable,
 new originals are to be taken and used.
 203.14.3 Hydraulic Excavation: After completion of drainage

 basins, silt fences, check dams, and other catchment areas. Reconstruct areas
 as necessary with acceptable soils in accordance with Section 203 at no
 direct pay.
 204.07 PROTECTION DURING SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS.
 Prior to the suspension of operations, shape the top of the earthwork in such
 manner as to permit runoff of rainwater and construct earth berms along the
 top edges of embankments to intercept runoff water. Provide temporary
 slope drains in the earth berm to carry runoff. When such preventive
 measures fail, immediately take other action as necessary to prevent erosion
 and siltation. The engineer may direct the contractor to perform other
 erosion control work during suspensions of contract time.
 204.08 MEASUREMENT. When separate items for temporary erosion
 control devices are included in the contract, and the work is directed by the
 engineer, the quantities to be measured for temporary mulching and
 temporary seeding will be in accordance with Sections 716 and 717,
 respectively. Measure sandbagging by volume in cubic yards (cu m) with
 the measurement of sand being made in a batch box or other satisfactory
 means. Measure the number of hay bales placed; the length in feet of
 temporary slope drains measured along the ground surface; and silt fencing
 148
 
 measured along ground surface; the number of sediment basins and sediment
 check dams; and the number of construction entrances.
 When temporary erosion control work is directed and is not covered by
 contract items, perform the work as extra work in accordance with 109.04.
 The construction of temporary earth berms along edges of the roadway to
 prevent erosion during grading and subsequent operations will not be
 measured for payment.
 In case of failure of the contractor to control erosion, or siltation, the
 engineer may employ outside assistance or use his own forces to provide the
 necessary corrective measures, and the cost thereof will be deducted from
 payments due the contractor for the work. Partial payments will be withheld
 until satisfactory temporary erosion control is established.
 204.09 PAYMENT. Payment for temporary erosion control items that are
 included as contract items will be made at the contract unit prices. Payment
 for temporary mulching, and seeding will be made under Sections 716 or
 717. Temporary erosion control work not covered by contract items that is
 ordered will be paid for in accordance with 109.04.
 Temporary Sandbagging and Baled Hay will be paid for directly when
 used other than in construction of Temporary Slope Drains, Temporary
 Sediment Basins and Temporary Sediment Check Dams. When sandbags or
 baled hay are used in construction of slope drains, sediment basins and
 sediment check dams, payment will be made under these items.
 Payment for devices used to correct unforeseen conditions will be made
 at the contract unit price for similar devices shown on the plans, or as extra
 work if plan details are not applicable.

 central mix plant by either batch or continuous mixing process. Soils,
 aggregates, additives, and water may be proportioned by either weight or
 volume. Calibrate the plant by weight and equip with a means to readily
 verify the quantity of each component. The time and points at which
 introducing each component into the mixing process must be approved.
 Combine and mix the components to produce a uniform, well-blended
 mixture. The total quantity of materials introduced into the mixing unit shall
 not exceed the approved capacity of the mixer.
 When using a continuous mix process, draw the soils and aggregates from
 the storage area by a feeder or feeders that continuously supply the correct
 amount of soil or aggregate in proportion to the cement. Arrange the soil
 and aggregate storage areas or feed bins so that the proportion of each size
 can be separately adjusted if using more than one size.
 Blend individual aggregates and soils within 2 percent of the individual
 weight of that component. The total weight of aggregate and soils shall be
 within 1 percent of the required weight of the total material. Incorporate
 cement within 1.0 percent of the required weight of cement.
 Determine optimum moisture of the mixture in accordance with DOTD
 TR 415 or TR 418. Do not allow the percentage of moisture in the mixture,
 based on dry weight, to vary from optimum moisture by more than
 ±2.0 percent at the time of compaction. Control moisture content at the time
 of mixing so that these tolerances are met. When these tolerances are not
 met and satisfactory control adjustments are not being made, discontinue
 operations until proper adjustments and uniform operations are established.
 301.07 QUALITY CONTROL OF PLANT OPERATIONS. Provide a
 Certified Soil and Base Course Technician at the plant at all times when the
 plant is producing material for the Department.
 The Certified Soil and Base Course Technician shall be capable of
 conducting any test or analysis necessary to put the plant into operation and
 producing cement stabilized mixtures conforming to the specifications. Do
 not begin daily plant operations without the Certified Soil and Base Course
 Technician present. The Soil and Base Course Technician certification will
 be awarded by the Department upon satisfactory completion of the
 Department’s requirements.

 loading. Cover soil cement mixtures immediately with an approved
 waterproof cover to prevent loss of moisture, fines, or exposure to the
 elements. Tie the cover securely in place and do not remove until placement
 of the mixture.
 Do not allow transportation, placing, and spreading methods to damage
 the subgrade. Place and spread sufficient material to obtain required width
 and compacted thickness within the tolerances set forth in 301.16. Place and
 spread soil cement within one hour of mixing cement with the soils or soil
 aggregates. Do not contaminate base course materials with subgrade layer.
 Any contamination will require retesting and correction of deficiencies. Do
 not place or spread base course material on portland cement concrete or
 asphalt concrete pavements. Do not damage pavement surfaces, edges, or
 joints during construction. Add water or use other suitable means to prevent
 dust during the transporting and placing of blended calcium sulfate.
 301.09 GRADE AND CROSS-SLOPE CONTROL. Unless otherwise
 specified, construct Class I Base Courses (except asphalt concrete) to the
 required grade and cross slope, using an automatic finishing machine
 controlled from an erected stringline or GPS and laser system conforming to
 502.08.2.2.
 301.10 COMPACTING AND FINISHING.
 301.10.1 Soil Cement: Compact the mixture immediately after
 placement. Complete initial compaction with an approved conventional
 sheepsfoot-type roller or a self-propelled tamping foot compactor-type roller
 in such a manner that no internal laminations occur in the completed base
 course. Use a pneumatic-tire roller for final compaction, operated so that no
 surface laminations occur. Keep the surface uniformly moist during
 compaction and shaping.
 During the compaction and finishing, correct low-riding areas or areas
 with surface imperfections that need correction using fresh material.
 Thoroughly scarify the surface before placing and blending new base
 material. Complete final compaction of the corrected surface within the
 160
 
 same time limit applied to the initial placement of base materials as outlined
 in this subsection.
 Complete compaction and initial finishing within two hours after initial
 mixing of cement with base course materials. Each lift of base course shall
 meet the requirements of 301.16. After compacting the base, uniformly
 apply water as needed to maintain the proper moisture content for
 intermediate finishing (tight blading). Thoroughly roll and finish the surface
 to grade; remove loosened material from the section. Finish rolling the
 surface with either a pneumatic-tire or static steel-wheel roller to provide a
 smooth, tightly knit surface conforming to finish grade or slightly higher.
 Use an automatic finishing machine for final finishing and provide a
 surface free of cracks, ridges, waves, surface laminations, or loose material.
 Do not allow the cross-slope to vary by more than ±0.003 foot/foot. Do not
 allow the grade to vary by more than ±0.04 feet from plan grade. In areas
 inaccessible to the automatic finishing machine, final finishing will not be
 required, provided the grade and cross-slope satisfies the project engineer.
 Conduct final finishing far enough in advance to allow the Department to
 perform width and depth check tests.
 At places inaccessible to rollers, such as edges adjacent to curb and gutter
 sections, compact the mixture using devices that will obtain the specified
 density without damage to adjacent structures.
 Do not operate transport vehicles and heavy construction equipment on
 compacted base course for a period of 72 hours after placement.
 301.10.2 Asphalt Concrete Base: Compaction and finishing
 requirements shall be as follows:
 1. Compact and finish the asphalt concrete layer in accordance with
 Section 502. Do not use vibratory rollers when such use is detrimental to the
 underlying layers or areas with high water table.
 2. The treated layer under asphalt concrete shall meet the
 requirements of the subgrade layer.
 301.10.3 Crushed Stone Recycled Portland Cement
 Concrete: Compact and finish the same as specified in 301.10.1, except

 compaction to damage underlying materials. Do not use vibratory rollers
 when it detrimental to the underlying layers or in areas with high water table.
 301.10.4 Blended Calcium Sulfate: During placement of blended
 calcium sulfate, the percentage of moisture in the mixture, by dry weight,
 shall not vary from the optimum moisture by more than ±2.0 percent. After
 application of water, allow the moisture to reach equilibrium in the base
 161
 
 before applying rolling techniques. Roll blended calcium sulfate to the edge
 of the embankment or subgrade. Compact each layer to at least 95 percent
 of maximum dry density before the next layer is placed. Determine optimum
 moisture and maximum density in accordance with DOTD TR 418
 Method G modified to include a maximum drying temperature of 140°F.
 Test all blended calcium sulfate base by proof rolling immediately prior
 to placement of surfacing material, including asphalt binder. Correct any
 irregularities or soft spots prior to placement of the surfacing material. Proof
 roll by using a load of 25 tons in a 12 to 14 cubic yard tandem dump truck
 with ten wheels or approved loaded truck determined by the project engineer.
 Proof rolling shall be a minimum of 5 passes in each direction at the same
 locations and at a maximum vehicle speed of 3 mph. Any rain event on the
 project site between the proof rolling and placement of the surfacing will
 require an additional proof rolling, as noted above.

 the first lift of surfacing within 30 calendar days unless otherwise directed.
 301.12.2 Crushed Stone, Recycled Portland Cement
 Concrete, and Blended Calcium Sulfate: Cover the completed base
 course with asphalt prime coat in accordance with Section 505 as soon as
 practical to prevent water infiltration due to rainfall. Maintain complete
 coverage of the asphalt prime coat from initial application until the
 placement of the next course. When allowing traffic, including construction
 162
 
 equipment, on the base course, the prime coat application may be delayed.
 However, place the first lift of surfacing within 30 calendar days unless
 otherwise directed.
 301.13 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS. On soil cement base courses, tie
 each day’s construction into the completed work of the previous day by a
 straight transverse construction joint. Form the joint by cutting back into the
 total width of the base to form a true vertical face free of loose and broken
 material at a point where the base conforms to the typical section shown on
 the plans.
 Longitudinal joints constructed between parallel lanes or similar joints
 between lanes and ramps, etc., shall be reasonably vertical and free of
 contaminated loose and/or broken material.
 Construct the base at all joints so that the materials at and adjacent to the

 damaged or unsound base course, remove a sufficient width and depth of
 base course to ensure satisfactory placement of patching material. The
 engineer must approve the type of patching material before use. Patching or
 other base course repair shall restore a uniform surface, shall conform to the
 requirements of the material being used, and shall be completed before
 paving operations begin. Patch failures detected during paving.
 When not requiring maintenance of traffic, allow neither public traffic
 nor construction traffic on the completed base course during the 72-hour
 curing period. When requiring maintenance of traffic and conditions permit,
 route both public traffic and construction traffic off the completed base
 course onto shoulders or other suitable areas during the 72-hour curing
 period. When permitting traffic to use the completed base course subsequent
 to the 72-hour curing period and prior to construction of the surface course,
 further protect the base by additional applications of asphalt curing
 membrane or prime coat in accordance with 301.12 at no direct pay.
 Prior to surface course construction, correct deficiencies and weak spots,
 clean the base course surface, repair any damages caused by traffic, and keep
 surface true to grade and cross-section at no direct pay. Apply additional
 163
 
 asphalt curing membrane or prime coat as directed at no direct pay.

 be placed on untreated or lime-treated soils.
 302.05 MIXING.
 302.05.1 Soil Cement: Combine soil with cement and water by inplace mixing or in a central plant and shape on the subgrade. When in-place
 mixing is done, spread and mix the cement prior to adding any more water.
 A minimum of 70 percent of the pulverized soil, as determined by DOTD
 TR 431, shall pass the No. 4 sieve after mixing. Determine the optimum
 moisture of the mixture in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or TR 418. The
 percentage of moisture in the mixture, by dry weight, shall not vary from the
 optimum moisture by more than ±2.0 percent at the time of compaction when
 tested in accordance with DOTD TR 403.
 302.05.1.1 In-Place Mixing: Samples to determine optimum
 moisture and maximum dry density will be taken by the project engineer.
 Determine maximum dry density in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or
 TR 418 and in-place density in accordance with DOTD TR 401. After
 placement of soil and prior to mixing with cement, shape the soil to required
 section and compact to at least 93.0 percent of maximum dry density at the
 required grade.
 From materials sampled in-place on the project, the engineer will
 determine the percentage of cement in accordance with DOTD TR 432 prior
 to mixing. Depending on the type of cement and soil to be used, normal
 testing time to determine required cement content may require 21 calendar
 days. Add water as needed to bring the moisture content of the mixture
 within the tolerance and uniformly mix with the materials. During the
 172
 
 mixing process, add water only through the spray bar of the in-place mixer
 which is adjusted to provide uniform coverage across the completed width
 of the roadway for the full depth of the base. Do not allow wet streaks or
 spots.
 The method of cement distribution shall be such that the amount of
 cement used can be readily determined. Determine the spread rate of cement
 in accordance with DOTD TR 436.
 When the moisture content is not within ±2.0 percent of optimum,
 discontinue operations and do not resume until the moisture content is
 controlled within this tolerance. Do not place and pulverize more than one
 transport until moisture content is within ±2.0 percent of optimum.
 302.05.1.2 Central Plant Mixing: Mixing in a central mix plant
 shall conform to Section 301. When using central plant mixing, a reduction
 of 1.0 percent in the volume of cement required will be permitted.
 302.05.2 Crushed Stone and Recycled Portland Cement
 Concrete: Do not allow crushed stone or recycled portland cement
 concrete base courses to segregate during construction. Take gradation
 samples in accordance with 1003.03 from the dedicated stockpiles at the
 point of material origin.
 302.05.3 Blended Calcium Sulfate: Do not use for crossovers,
 drives, or in areas needed to facilitate traffic control. In lieu of blended
 calcium sulfate, substitute any untreated Class II base course material listed
 in 302.01. Do not place blended calcium sulfate within 10 feet of metal
 drainage structures. Use approved backfill material in Section 701.
 302.06 TRANSPORTING AND PLACING ON SUBGRADE. Use
 only transportation and spreading methods that do not damage the subgrade.
 Place and spread sufficient base course material to obtain required width and
 compacted thickness within the tolerances set forth in 302.12. Do not allow
 subgrade material to contaminate the base course. Any contamination will
 require retesting and correction of deficiencies. Do not place, spread, or mix
 base course material on portland cement concrete or asphalt concrete
 pavements. Do not allow base course construction operations to damage
 adjacent pavement surfaces, edges and joints. Add water or use other
 suitable means to prevent dust during the transporting and placing of
 materials.

 the material and finish in accordance with 303.06.
 Begin mixing operations within one hour of placement. Complete
 compaction and finishing operations within three hours after initial mixing
 of cement with base course materials. Upon expiration of the three-hour
 period after initial mixing, only intermediate finishing (tight blading) of the
 base course surface will be allowed. Dispose of excess bladed material. Do
 not drift bladed material along the base. Use stabilized material in the base
 course except for that small amount necessary for tight blading. Excessive
 blading, exceeding 10 percent of the base thickness, to achieve plan depth
 will not be allowed. Complete operations, including tight blading, within
 24 hours of mixing. The finished base course shall have a smooth, uniform,
 closely-knit surface, free from ridges, waves, laminations, or loose materials.
 Do not spread cement within 2 hours of sunset, unless otherwise approved
 by the project engineer.

 treatment in accordance with this section that comply with the requirements
 of 302.02.1. If an A-4 or A-6 Soil Group material is used for cement
 treatment, it shall meet the durability requirements of DOTD TR 432.
 303.02.1 Determination of Cement Rate:
 303.02.1.1 Predetermined (Plan Specified): For portland
 cement, mix the roadbed material with the rate of cement by volume as
 shown on the plans.
 303.02.1.2 Non-Predetermined: If the percent cement has not
 been predetermined, the District Laboratory will determine the percent of
 cement by volume in accordance with DOTD TR 432 from materials
 sampled in-place on the project. The Department will take samples for
 percent cement determination from isolated random areas selected by the
 183
 
 project engineer, prepared for sampling by the contractor. Thoroughly
 pulverize and mix the sampling area to the satisfaction of the project
 engineer. Resurface sampling areas as directed after samples are taken and
 maintain to the satisfaction of the project engineer. Payment for resurfacing
 will be made under the appropriate asphalt concrete roadway or maintenance
 aggregate items.
 Depending on materials to be stabilized, normal testing time to determine
 the required cement content may require up to 21 calendar days.
 303.02.1.3 Contractor Selected Cement Type: If selecting
 Type IP or IS as the cementitious material, determine the rate of blended
 cement prior to mixing using TR 432, Method B or C, whichever applies,
 using the design compressive strength criteria listed for treatment or
 stabilization. In addition, determine the durability of the base course mixture
 using Type IP or IS in accordance with DOTD TR 432 with the rate of
 cementitious material determined from Method B or C. Perform the
 laboratory testing specified above for Types IP or IS cement at no expense
 to the Department. The laboratory used must be approved by the Materials
 Engineer Administrator.
 Take samples, in the presence of the engineer, by methods described in
 303.02.1.2 above. Payment for resurfacing and subsequent maintenance to
 the satisfaction of the engineer shall be at no expense to the Department.
 During sampling operations, obtain sufficient material to provide the
 District laboratory with approximately 200 pounds of the base material to be
 treated for verification testing. Take samples for verification from randomly
 spaced locations, determined by the engineer, throughout the project length.
 The engineer will take immediate possession of the verification samples.
 Also provide approximately 10 pounds of the selected cementitious material
 to the District laboratory. Provide materials for verification testing at no cost
 to the Department.
 Submit all design data used to determine the recommended cement rate
 to the District Laboratory Engineer for approval. Prior to approval of the
 design, the District Laboratory will perform verification testing.
 Verification testing by the District Laboratory will consist of molding,
 curing, and testing a minimum of three specimens in accordance with
 TR 432, at the percentage of cementitious material and at the optimum
 moisture determined by the contractor’s laboratory. The recommended
 cement rate will be considered verified if test results indicate that the
 minimum strength and durability criteria as specified have been met and that
 the optimum moisture are within 2 percent of that submitted by the
 184
 
 contractor. Normal testing time for verification testing may require up to
 21 calendar days. Do not begin construction operations until the design is
 approved.
 303.03 EQUIPMENT. Furnish and maintain the equipment necessary to
 produce a finished base course meeting specification requirements.
 Equipment shall be approved prior to use. Pulverize using an approved inplace mixer.
 Use an in-place mixer equipped with a spray bar that can apply water
 across the full width of the cut and be adjusted to prevent overlap of water
 on adjacent paths.
 Distribute cement from transports using spreader bars approved by the
 engineer. The engineer may require the use of a cement spreader capable of
 width adjustment and equipped with a calibrated spreader box if a uniform
 cement spread cannot be achieved. The Department may verify the
 distribution of dry additives using DOTD TR 436, Method A. Perform initial
 compaction using a conventional sheepsfoot-type roller or a self-propelled
 tamping foot compactor-type roller. The spikes shall be sufficient in size
 and number to provide uniform compaction for the full width and depth of
 the base course. Perform finish rolling with a pneumatic tire roller.
 303.04 PREPARATION OF ROADBED. Unless otherwise designated
 on the plans, remove all existing asphalt concrete surfacing except the
 bottom 1 inch in accordance with Section 509 prior to cement stabilization.
 During these removal and replacement operations, maintain the areas used
 by public traffic in a safe condition in accordance with 105.15. Scarify and
 pulverize materials to be stabilized for the full width and depth of the base
 course. Pulverize the remaining existing asphalt surfacing and uniformly
 mix it with materials below the surfacing.
 Do not prepare roadbed in excess of 2 miles in advance of roadway base
 course stabilization or treatment. When approved by the project engineer,
 the 2-mile limit may be extended. However, when the 2-mile limit is
 extended, the lag between preparation of roadbed and base stabilization or
 treatment shall not exceed 5 working days. When stabilizing or treating
 shoulders separately from roadway base, the 2-mile limitation will not apply
 to shoulders.
 Blend the scarified and pulverized material to achieve uniform blending.
 When existing material is not uniform across the full width to be stabilized,
 blend the material to form a uniform blend for the full width and depth of the
 185
 
 base course.
 Scarify and pulverize the roadbed to at least 60 percent passing the No. 4
 sieve in accordance with DOTD TR 431 prior to mixing with cement.
 Identify and remove existing concrete or asphalt concrete patches
 encountered during roadbed preparation operations. Remove patches and
 disposed of in accordance with 202.02.
 After the roadbed has been prepared as specified above, shape the
 roadbed to the required section and uniformly compact the roadbed material
 to at least 93.0 percent of maximum dry density prior to mixing with cement.
 Determine maximum dry density in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or
 TR 418. Determine in-place density in accordance with DOTD TR 401.

 density at no direct pay.
 303.05 MIXING. The method of spread shall be such that the amount of
 cement used can be readily determined when tested in accordance with
 DOTD TR 436. Uniformly spread and mix cement with the material. Make
 a minimum of two passes with the mixer (stabilizer). Shape the mixture to
 the required section.
 Add water as needed by means of the mixer and uniformly incorporate
 the mixture in amounts required to attain optimum moisture for the mixture.
 During the mixing process, add water only through the spray bar of the inplace mixer, adjusted to provide uniform coverage across the completed
 width of the roadway for the full depth of the base. Do not allow wet streaks
 or spots.
 Determine optimum moisture of the mixture in accordance with DOTD
 TR 415 or TR 418. Do not allow the percentage of moisture, determined in
 accordance with DOTD TR 403, in the mixture by dry weight to vary from
 optimum moisture by more than ±2 percent at the time of compaction.
 303.06 COMPACTING AND FINISHING. Uniformly compact the
 mixture immediately upon completion of mixing to the specified depth and
 width shown in the plans. Complete initial compaction with an approved
 sheepsfoot-type roller or a self-propelled tamping foot compactor-type roller
 in such a manner that no internal laminations occur in the completed base
 course. Complete final compaction with a pneumatic tire roller.
 Keep the surface uniformly moist during compacting and final finishing.
 Continue compaction until each lift of base course has met the requirements
 of 303.11.
 186
 
 At places inaccessible to rollers, such as edges adjacent to curb and gutter
 sections, compact the mixture using devices that will obtain the specified
 density without damaging adjacent structures.
 Begin mixing operations within one hour of placement. Complete
 compaction and finishing operations within three hours after initial mixing
 of cement with base course materials. Upon expiration of the three-hour
 period after initial mixing, only intermediate finishing (tight blading) of the
 base course surface will be allowed. Dispose of excess bladed material. Do
 not drift bladed material along the base. Use stabilized or treated material in
 the base course except that small amount necessary for tight blading.
 Excessive blading, exceeding 10 percent of the base thickness, to achieve
 plan depth will not be allowed. Complete operations, including tight
 blading, within 24 hours of mixing. The finished base course shall have a
 smooth, uniform, closely-knit surface, free from ridges, waves, laminations,
 or loose material. Do not spread cement within two hours before sunset,
 unless otherwise approved by the project engineer.
 303.07 QUALITY CONTROL. Control the preparation of roadbed,
 selection and placement of materials, cement spread, mixing, compaction,
 moisture content, density, thickness, width, surface finish, grade, and cross
 slope so that the completed base course is uniform and conforms to plan
 dimensions and other acceptance requirements as provided herein. Control
 operations so that contamination, segregation, soft spots, wet spots,
 laminations, and other deficiencies are prevented. Take such tests as
 necessary to adequately control the work.
 303.08 PROTECTION AND CURING. Upon completion of final
 finishing, immediately protect the base against rapid drying by applying an
 asphalt curing membrane in accordance with Section 506. Maintain
 complete coverage of curing membrane from the initial application until the
 placement of the next course. When allowing traffic, including construction
 equipment, on the base course, place at least the first lift of surfacing within
 30 calendar days unless otherwise directed.
 303.09 MAINTENANCE. Protect the completed base course from
 damage due to either public traffic or the contractor’s operations, and
 satisfactorily maintain the completed base course including asphalt curing
 membrane. Repair damaged base course at no direct pay. When requiring
 patching of the base course, in addition to removing damaged or unsound
 187
 
 base course, remove a sufficient width and depth of base course to ensure
 satisfactory placement of patching material. Submit the proposed type of
 patching materials to the engineer for review and comment before use.
 Complete patching or other repairs of the base course to restore a uniform
 surface, conforming to the requirements of the material used, prior to
 surfacing operations.
 Do not allow public traffic or construction traffic on the completed base
 course for a 72-hour curing period. If conditions permit, route both public
 traffic and construction traffic off the completed base course onto shoulders
 or other suitable areas during the 72-hour curing period. Traffic may be
 permitted on the base course during the curing period, if conditions warrant
 and if approved by the engineer.
 When permitting traffic to use the completed base prior to the
 construction of the surface course, further protect the base by additional
 applications of asphalt curing membrane in accordance with 302.10 as
 directed at no direct pay. Prior to surface course construction, clean the base
 course and apply and maintain additional asphalt curing membrane as
 directed at no direct pay.
 Correct any weak spots that develop. Keep the base course free from
 deficiencies and true to grade and cross section at no direct pay. When the
 surfacing is asphalt concrete, place the first lift of surfacing within
 30 calendar days.
 303.10 WEATHER LIMITATIONS. Do not mix when the base course
 material is frozen, when raining, when the ambient air temperature is below
 35°F, or the temperature forecasted by the U.S. Weather Service is to be
 25°F or less within the 24-hour period following placement.
 303.11 ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS. The department will test
 soils and aggregates from samples taken after preparation of the roadbed.
 Test cement spread rate in accordance with DOTD TR 436. Test the
 moisture content of the cement stabilized or treated mixtures for compliance
 with optimum moisture content in accordance with DOTD TR 403 at
 placement at least twice per day.
 Test the pulverization of the prepared roadbed in accordance with DOTD
 TR 431, and must be at least 60 percent passing the No. 4 sieve.

 309.02.1 Determination of Cement Rate
 309.02.1.1 Predetermined (Plan Specified): For portland
 cement, mix the roadbed material with the rate of cement by volume as
 shown on the plans.
 309.02.1.2 Non-Predetermined: If the percent cement has not
 been predetermined, the rate will be provided by the engineer. The District
 212
 
 Laboratory may determine the percent of cement by volume in accordance
 with DOTD TR 432, Method B or C from materials sampled in-place on the
 project from isolated random areas selected by the engineer. Depending on
 the materials to be treated, normal testing time to determine the required
 cement content may require up to 21 calendar days.
 309.02.1.3 Contractor Selected Cement Type: When the
 contractor elects to use blended hydraulic cement the rate of cement shall be
 determined in accordance with 303.02.1.3 at no expense to the Department.
 309.03 EQUIPMENT. Furnish and maintain equipment necessary to
 produce a finished product meeting specification requirements in accordance

 309.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 309.04.1 Treatment and Pulverization: Treat subgrade soils by
 mixing with portland cement in accordance with Section 303. Compact and
 finish treated materials in accordance with Section 203.
 When traffic conditions warrant, and an adequate rolling pattern has been
 established that demonstrates density and pulverization as achieved, the
 engineer may reduce density frequency testing requirements to expedite
 construction. A change in subgrade materials will require testing at the
 original frequency until a new rolling pattern is established.
 Make reasonable efforts to conform to the compaction requirements
 above. When field conditions make this impractical or detrimental, such as
 a yielding subgrade, establish an optimum rolling pattern to the satisfaction
 of the engineer. The engineer has the option of increasing or decreasing the
 percentages of cement based on field conditions. Determine optimum
 moisture of the mixture in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or TR 418.
 Increase the cement content by one percent by volume for every 3 percent of
 moisture content above optimum.
 After treatment the pulverized mixture shall conform to the gradation
 requirements in Table 309-1.

 JMF proposal for approval which is representative of the mixture that will
 be produced and meets the design requirements prior to validation or
 production. Prior to JMF approval, present a Certificate of Analysis showing
 aggregate physical properties conforming to Table 501-2.
 Design and report mix temperatures between 300⁰F and 350⁰F on the
 JMF.
 A change in the asphalt cement source will require testing for Moisture
 Susceptibility in accordance with DOTD TR 317 and either AASHTO T324
 or DOTD TR 322.
 501.04 LOT SIZES. A lot is a segment of continuous production of
 asphalt concrete mixture from the same JMF produced for the Department at
 a specific plant, delivered to a specific DOTD project. A lot is defined as
 2400 tons of mixture production, a sublot is 800 tons. The final lot may be
 increased up to 50 percent of an original lot size with the mutual agreement
 of the contractor and Project Engineer.
 501.05 JOB MIX FORMULA (JMF) VALIDATION. Validate the JMF
 on the first lot (1200 ton, 3-400 ton sublots) of production for a project by
 meeting the requirements of Table 501-1 and 501-3. The District Laboratory
 and Contractor shall jointly test three sublots for theoretical maximum
 specific gravity (Gmm), percent air voids, percent asphalt cement content, and
 extracted aggregate gradation. Each individual test result shall meet
 specifications. The average values will be used for verification tolerances in
 226
 
 Table 501-4. Validate the mixture using AASHTO T324 loaded wheel and
 Gyratory AASHTO T312 through testing of gyratory mix or roadway core
 on the second day of production. If failure occurs, adjust mix and revalidate.
 If second failure occurs, redesign the mix. All JMF’s shall be re-validated a
 minimum of every 2 years. Re-validation may consist of reviewing ongoing
 production plant data and plant verification data.
 501.06 PLANT QUALITY CONTROL. Ensure that the plant equipment
 and processes conform to Section 503. Produce mixtures at temperatures not
 to exceed 350⁰F. Sample and test according to the Materials Sampling
 Manual. Prepare Gyratory specimen in accordance with AASHTO T312.
 Any change in material will require a new approved JMF.
 Keep accurate records, including proof of deliveries of all materials used
 in this process.
 Sample and test the mixture for extracted aggregate gradation, asphalt
 cement content, and theoretical maximum specific gravity (G mm) testing at
 the frequency listed in the Materials Sampling Manual. Ensure that the
 average individual deviations from JMF target values of each test result meet
 the requirements of Table 501-4. For each lot, report all quality control data
 to the Department’s Certified Plant Inspector. Apply the extracted gradation
 tolerances listed in Table 501-3 to the JMF design target gradation. Ensure
 that JMF target is within the range of extracted aggregate gradation listed in
 501-3. The District Laboratory Engineer may require re-validation of the
 mix when the average of the Quality Control data indicates non-compliance
 with the specified limits or tolerances. Control charts may be requested by
 the engineer if mixture problems develop.
 501.06.1 Acceptance and Verification: Meet the verification
 requirements of Table 501-03 and Table 501-04 tolerances.
 The Department will:
 1. Perform all acceptance and verification testing using the stratified
 random sampling approach in accordance with S605 of the

 improper joint construction, or other deficiencies, apparent on visual
 inspection, will not be accepted.
 501.09.1 Opening to Traffic: Do not open the new pavement to
 traffic or allow any roller to sit idle on the pavement until the rolling
 operation is complete and the material has cooled to a temperature where the
 mat will not be damaged by traffic.
 501.09.2 Smoothness: Measure the International Roughness Index
 (IRI) using a Department approved automated profiler before and after
 laydown operations in the presence of a Project Engineer’s representative.
 Measure IRI in accordance with DOTD TR644, on the travel lanes for
 highways and the center two lanes for airports before placement and meet
 Table 502-5 requirements. Ensure a maximum transverse deviation of 1/8
 inch due to roller marks and 1/4 inch maximum deviation for longitudinal
 joint differences.
 Submit initial and final measurements to the engineer on a USB data
 storage device.
 501.10 MEASUREMENT. Measure the Thin Asphalt Concrete
 applications by the ton. Measure the tack coat in accordance with Section

 made at the contract unit price per ton which includes furnishing all required
 materials, labor, equipment, tools and incidentals necessary for producing
 the mixtures, preparing the surfaces on which the mixtures are to be placed,
 hauling the mixtures to the work site, and placing and compacting the
 mixtures. Asphalt tack coat will not be a pay item and will be considered
 incidental to the 501 item. However, if the engineer adjusts the application
 rate of tack coat from that specified by the contract document, payment for
 the asphalt mixture will be increased or decreased based on the difference in
 the applied quantity of asphalt emulsion shown on paid invoices (total of
 
 229
 
 charges). The contractor shall provide copies of paid invoices for this
 determination. Apply 95 percent payment to the 501 item when the tack coat
 rates do not meet the application rate as allowed by the engineer. Payment
 will be subject to the payment adjustment schedules as shown in Table 5015.
 Payment adjustments will be assessed on a per lot basis. The percent
 payment for the roadway lot will be the lowest value of the payment
 adjustment parameters. Adjustment for smoothness will be per travel lane
 for the entire project in accordance with Table 501-6.
 Payment for removal of pavement markings shall be in accordance with
 applicable item.

 502.02.2 Additives.
 502.02.2.1 Anti-Strip (AS): Add anti-strip additive at the
 minimum rate of 0.6 percent by weight of asphalt cement and thoroughly
 mix in-line with the virgin asphalt cement at the plant. Increase the anti-strip
 additive or change to different additive as needed to meet Loaded Wheel
 Test, LWT, requirements. Discontinue production until satisfactory
 adjustments are made when the amount of anti-strip additive is not in
 accordance with the approved JMF.
 502.02.2.2 Hydrated Lime: When used, specify rate of hydrated
 lime additive on the Job Mix Formula. Add hydrated lime additive at a
 minimum of 1.5 percent and thoroughly mix with aggregates in conformance
 with 503.05.5 as required to meet LWT requirements.
 502.02.2.3 Waste Tire Rubber Additive: When used, crumb
 rubber may be pre-blended or, with approval by the Materials Laboratory,
 
 237
 
 may be blended at the plant. The maximum rubber replacement is 10 percent
 by weight of asphalt.
 When blending crumb rubber at the contractor’s plant, add crumb rubber
 to a PG 67-22 material on the Approved Materials List. Add 30 mesh (or
 finer) crumb rubber as required to meet grade PG 82-22rm. Comply with
 1002.02.2
 502.02.2.4 Latex Additive: When added at the contractor’s plant,
 blend a minimum of 1.0 percent residual latex by weight of asphalt cement
 to a PG 67-22 material on the Approved Material List, and in accordance
 with Section 503. Meet PG 70-22m requirement using pre-qualified asphalt
 material and latex.
 502.02.2.5 Warm Mix Asphalt Additives: When used, add only
 approved warm mix chemical additives. Foaming is allowed.
 502.02.3 Aggregates: Use aggregates from approved sources.
 Blend aggregates to meet Sections 502 and 1003.
 502.02.3.1 Friction Ratings: Friction ratings for aggregates are
 determined in accordance with 1003.01.2.4. Table 502-3 describes the
 friction ratings and corresponding usage allowed for the current average
 daily traffic (ADT) shown on the plans. Friction rating requirements apply
 to the mainline wearing course only, unless a finish course is applied. If a
 finish course is applied, then the friction rating requirements do not apply
 to wearing course.

 When the average daily traffic (ADT) is less than 2500, blending of Friction Rating IV aggregates with
 Friction Rating I and/or II aggregates will be allowed for travel lane wearing courses at the following
 percentages. At least 50 percent by weight (mass) of the total aggregate in the mixture shall have a
 Friction Rating of I or II. The frictional aggregates used to obtain the required percentages shall not
 have more than 10 percent passing the No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve.
 
 239
 
 502.02.3.2 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP): Keep reclaimed
 asphalt pavement separate from other materials at the plant in such a manner
 that will allow for Department inspection and acceptance. Keep stockpiles
 uniform and free of soil, debris, foreign matter and other contaminants.
 Allowable RAP percentages are defined in Table 502-6. Screen or crush
 RAP to pass a maximum of 2 inch sieve prior to use. Additional RAP is
 allowed in all mixes except for Airports and SMA when RAP stockpile is
 pre-screened on a 1 inch scalping screen.
 502.02.3.3 Mineral Filler:
 When used, comply with the
 requirements of 1003.06.6.
 502.02.3.4 Natural Sand: When used, meet the requirements of
 Table 502-6 and 1003.06.3.
 502.02.3.5 Fibers: When required to prevent draindown, use
 cellulose or mineral fiber, meeting the requirements of 1002.02.5 When
 used, add fibers at a rate sufficient to prevent draindown.
 502.03 DESIGN OF ASPHALT MIXTURES AND JOB MIX
 FORMULA (JMF) APPROVAL. Design all asphalt mixtures for optimum
 asphalt content in compliance with the mix design in accordance with
 AASHTO M323, AASHTO M325 for SMA, and the requirements of Table
 502-6 and Table 1003-14.
 At minimum, all design submittals must include the recommended
 materials proportions, extracted gradation, recommended mix and
 compaction temperatures, and supporting design data. Submit the
 recommended JMF electronically through Site Manager Materials (SMM)
 or other data system as designated by the Department for District Laboratory
 Engineer acceptance with all supporting design data. No mixture shall be
 produced until the proposed JMF has been accepted.
 Indicate the optimum mixing and compaction temperatures as suggested
 by the asphalt binder supplier on the JMF. Mix temperatures are
 recommended by the asphalt supplier as determined by rotational viscosity
 or other means. Warm Mix Asphalt technology may be used to reduce this
 temperature and must be noted on the JMF. Warm mix asphalt may be
 substituted with a minimum production temperature of 275°F.
 Once a plant is producing an acceptable JMF, keep JMF production
 within the specified tolerances. Changes will be reviewed and accepted by
 the District Laboratory Engineer as necessary.
 The engineer may require a new mix design when roadway acceptance
 requirements are not being met or plant quality data indicates noncompliance.
 240
 
 502.03.1 Mixtures Design Substitutions: Use only Warm Mix
 Asphalt (WMA) additives that are listed on the Approved Material List.
 The 3/4-inch Nominal Maximum Size (NMS) wearing course may be
 substituted for binder course but not substituted for base course. The 1-inch
 NMS binder course may be substituted for base course.
 The 1/2-inch NMS wearing course may be substituted for incidental
 paving, Level A. Shoulders may be any mixture type shown in Table 502-4
 regardless of design level except that shoulder wearing must be a 1/2-inch or
 3/4-inch NMS mixture.
 Apply all specification requirements for the substituted mixture with the
 following exceptions: When wearing course is substituted for binder course,
 Table 502-3 does not apply. When wearing or binder are substituted for
 binder or base, the allowable RAP percentage shall meet the intended use
 specified in Table 502-6.
 When a 501 finish course and a 502 wearing course are required on a
 project, allowable RAP percentage for wearing may meet binder course
 requirement.
 502.04 JOB MIX FORMULA VALIDATION AND APPROVAL.
 The Department and contractor will jointly test plant mix to validate each
 JMF for mainline mixture and accept each JMF whenever a plant begins
 initial operations for the Department in a specific plant location, or whenever
 a plant experiences a change in materials or change in source of materials,
 or when there are significant changes in equipment, such as the introduction
 of a new crusher, drum mixer, burner, foaming device, etc. Evaluate each
 JMF at least once every two years. Meet LWT requirements and all
 applicable requirements of Table 502-6.
 For Minor Mixes, validation is not required for mixture designs, but the
 mixture must meet specification requirements. In order to validate minor
 mixes, the plant Gmm must be determined.
 The average of the first five (5) plant Gmms will become the new JMF target.
 For all mixes, validation is not required when the asphalt grade has
 changed or asphalt source has changed, but must meet LWT requirements
 and all applicable requirements of Table 502-6.
 502.04.1 Validation Plant Lot: The validation plant lot (“VP-lot”),
 is a maximum of 2000 tons of plant produced mix. Divide into 5 equal
 parts for validation sampling and testing.
 502.04.2 Validation: Report the mean, standard deviation, Quality
 Index and percent within limits (PWL) of the test results in accordance
 with the QA manual. The JMF is considered conditionally validated if the
 
 241
 
 following parameters are 71 percent within limits of the JMF and meet the
 specifications.
 1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity (Gmm),
 2. Percent Gmm at Ninitial,
 3. Percent passing the No. 8 and No. 200 sieves,
 4. Percent Air Voids at Ndesign, and
 5. VFA.
 The average of all other validation tests shall meet the specifications
 limits in Table 502-6. The production can continue during conditional
 validation. The JMF is considered validated with passing LWT results. If
 the LWT fails twice, cease production and re-design. Upon validation of the
 JMF, the average of the validated results will become the JMF targets.
 502.04.3 Payment for Plant Validation: Payment will be in
 accordance with 502.15.
 The validation mixture is not paid separately, but is considered part of the
 roadway lot.
 502.05 QUALITY CONTROL AND PLANT ACCEPTANCE. All
 quality control information, plant records, etc. will be considered part of the
 Department’s acceptance decision. Exercise quality control over all
 materials and their assembly, design, processing, production, hauling,
 laydown and associated equipment to ensure compliance with Table 502-4
 and all other specifications herein. At the end of each production day, notify
 the District Lab Engineer (DLE) and the DOTD Asphalt District Inspector
 (ADI) of the next scheduled mix production run and placement.
 For plant quality control, a plant lot, or “P-Lot’ is defined as 1000 tons of
 continuously produced mixture from one JMF. Obtain a sample of plant
 mixture and test the mixture once every 1000 tons using a random sampling
 approach. Minimum quality control testing for each P-Lot is as follows:
 Loose Mix
 1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity, Gmm
 2. % Asphalt Cement Content
 3. Gradation
 4. % Crushed
 5. Temperature, and
 6. % Moisture content
 
 242
 
 Compacted Specimen, Ndesign
 1. % Gmm at Ninitial
 2. % Air Voids, V
 3. % VMA
 4. % VFA, and
 5. % Gmm at Nmax (1 per 5 P-Lots)
 
 Age all loose mix tested for Gmm or volumetrics for one hour in
 accordance with AASHTO R30 prior to testing. Age warm mix for two
 hours.
 Determine the rolling five test results average and standard deviation for
 aggregate gradation, asphalt content, air voids, and Gmm. Take corrective
 action or cease production when the latest rolling five test results show:
 1. Air voids or Gmm fall below 71 PWL (based on the lastest rolling
 five test results); or
 2. Average VFA is outside of specification limits; or
 3. Gradation for the No. 8 and No. 200 sieve is outside of
 specification limits; or
 4. Asphalt content is ±0.2% the JMF target.
 Enter all plant quality control data into the Department’s approved data
 management system. The full range of gradation mix tolerances will be
 allowed even if they fall outside the control points. The District Laboratory
 Engineer may require re-validation of the mix when the average of the
 Quality Control data indicates non-compliance with the specified limits or
 tolerances.
 Measure the moisture content of the cold feed aggregates daily in
 accordance with DOTD TR 403. The moisture content of the final mixture,
 measured daily, shall not exceed 0.3 percent by weight (mass) when tested
 in accordance with DOTD TR 319.
 502.06 PLANT INSPECTION AND AUDITS.
 All Department
 inspection procedures, including sampling and testing, and the
 contractor’s quality control data form the basis for acceptance of the
 asphalt. The Department’s Certified Asphalt Plant Inspector will randomly
 visit and inspect asphalt plants, sample and test material, and review
 documentation to ensure conformance to specification requirements. In
 particular, the inspector will take a minimum of the following samples which
 may be tested for verification:
 
 243
 
 Loose Mix
 1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity, Gmm,
 2. % Asphalt Cement Content,
 3. Gradation, and
 4. % Crushed
 Compacted Specimen, Ndesign (Using contractor’s equipment)
 1. % Gmm at Ninitial,
 2. % Air Voids, Va,
 3. % VMA, and
 4. % VFA.
 Compacted Specimen, 7.0 ± 0.5% AV (Using contractor’s equipment)
 1. Loaded Wheel Testing (LWT) as needed.
 The inspector will review contractor data and documentation. The
 inspector will check the plant equipment, lab equipment and plant
 operations. The inspector will sample asphalt cement working tank and or
 transport during random plant visits and will obtain random asphalt cement
 transport samples as requested by the Materials Lab.
 Lack of conformance after 5 P-lots to specification requirements may
 result in increased sampling, reduced pay, removal and replacement of the
 asphalt mixture, decertification of the technician, and/or decertification of
 the plant. Correct deficiencies or cease operations.
 502.07 ROADWAY OPERATIONS.
 502.07.1 Weather Limitations: Apply asphalt concrete mixtures on
 a dry surface when the ambient temperature is above 50°F for wearing
 courses and 40°F for base and binder courses. Material in transit, or a
 maximum of 100 tons in a surge bin or silo used as a surge bin, at the time
 plant operation is discontinued may be placed. All mixture placed is
 expected to perform satisfactorily and meet specification requirements.
 Inclement weather will be sufficient reason to terminate or not begin
 production.
 When base course mixtures are placed in plan thicknesses of 2 3/4 inches
 or greater, disregard temperature limitations provided all other specification
 requirements are met. When a wearing course is substituted for a binder
 course mixture, apply the temperature limitation for binder course.
 
 244
 
 502.07.2 Surface Preparation: Maintain the surface being covered.
 Acceptance is required for each surface prior to placement of subsequent
 surface.
 Roadway slope shall be established at the base course level unless
 otherwise authorized by the engineer. The absolute minimum lift thickness
 placed shall be 1/4 inch greater than the nominal maximum aggregate size
 as shown on Table 502-6. Failure to meet minimum thickness is subject to
 removal.
 502.07.2.1 Cleaning: Sweep the surface to be covered clean of
 dust, dirt, caked clay, caked material, vegetation, and loose material by
 revolving brooms or other mechanical sweepers supplemented with hand
 equipment as directed. Remove excess joint filler from the surface by an
 approved method when mixtures are to be placed on portland cement
 concrete pavement or previously overlaid portland cement concrete.
 Remove any existing raised pavement markers prior to asphalt concrete
 overlay operations. Payment for removal of pavement markings will be in
 accordance with the applicable item.
 Wash the surface with water in addition to brooming when brooming
 alone does not adequately clean the surface.
 When tack coat is exposed to traffic for more than one (1) calendar day,
 becomes contaminated, or degrades due to inclement weather, reapply the
 tack coat at the initial recommended rate at no direct pay.
 502.07.2.2 Applying Tack Coat:
 502.07.2.2.1
 Existing Pavement Surfaces:
 Before
 constructing each course, apply an approved asphalt tack coat in accordance
 with Section 504. Protect the tack coat and spot patch as required.
 502.07.2.2.2
 Raw Aggregate Base Course and Raw
 Embankment Surfaces: Apply an approved asphalt prime coat to
 unprimed surfaces, or protect in-place prime coat and spot apply prime coat
 as required, in accordance with Section 505.
 502.07.2.2.3
 Cement and Lime Stabilized or Treated
 Embankment and Base Course Surfaces: Apply an approved asphalt
 curing membrane when none is in place, or protect the in-place curing
 membrane and spot apply, as required, with asphalt material in accordance
 with Section 506.
 502.07.2.2.4
 Other Surfaces: Cover contact surfaces of
 curbs, gutters, manholes, edges of longitudinal and transverse joints, and
 other structures with a uniform coating of an approved asphalt tack coat
 complying with Section 504 before placing asphalt mixtures.
 502.07.3 Joint Construction:
 
 245
 
 502.07.3.1 Longitudinal Joints:
 When constructing
 longitudinal joints, set the screed to allow approximately 2 inches onto the
 adjacent pass. Use approved 10-foot static straight edge to maintain no
 greater than 1/8-inch deviation in grade. Make necessary correction in joint
 before continuing operations. Offset longitudinal joints in one layer over
 those in the layer below by a minimum of 3 inches; however, keep the top
 layer joint 6 inches to 9 inches from the centerline of two lane highways.
 Offset 6 inches to 9 inches from lane lines when the roadway is more than
 two lanes. Construct the narrow strip first.
 502.07.3.2 Transverse Joints: Construct transverse joints by
 milling or hand forming paper butt joints. Use an approved 10-foot static
 straightedge to identify the location to be cut back to maintain no greater
 than a 1/8-inch deviation in grade. Lightly tack the cut face of the previously
 placed mat before fresh material is placed. Rest the screed on shims that are
 approximately 25 percent of lift thickness placed on the compacted mat.
 Provide an adequate crew to form transverse joints. Additionally, meet the
 transverse joint surface tolerance requirements of Table 502-5. Make
 necessary corrections to the joint before continuing placement operations.
 Offset transverse joints in succeeding lifts by at least 3 feet.
 502.08 HAULING, PAVING AND FINISHING. Transport mixtures
 from the plant and deliver to the paver at a temperature no cooler than 25°F
 below the lower limit of the approved job mix formula, maintaining a
 temperature of the WMA mix not cooler than 245°F going through the
 paver. Send no loads so late in the day that completion of spreading and
 compaction of the mixture cannot be completed during daylight, unless
 artificial lighting has been approved and is on site.
 Load haul trucks to minimize segregation.
 Place each course of asphalt mixture in accordance with the specified lift
 thickness shown in Table 502-6.
 With the engineer's approval, motor patrols may be used to level isolated
 depressions in the initial layer, provided this construction does not result in
 unsatisfactory subsequent lifts.
 502.08.1 Coordination of Production: Coordinate and manage
 plant production, transportation of mix and placement operations to achieve
 a high quality pavement. Provide sufficient hauling vehicles to ensure
 continuous plant and roadway operations. The engineer will order a halt to
 operations when sufficient hauling vehicles are not available.
 On final wearing course construction under traffic with pavement layers
 of 2 inches compacted thickness or less, the contractor will be permitted to
 246
 
 pave one travel lane for a full day and the adjacent travel lane the next work
 day. When the adjacent travel lane is not paved the next work day and the
 longitudinal joint is exposed to traffic for more than 3 calendar days, and it
 has been determined that the roadway edge is not true to line and grade as
 previously constructed, cut back the entire length of exposed longitudinal
 joint to lift thickness to a vertical edge and heavily tack unless a notch wedge
 device is used. When pavement layers are greater than 2 inches compacted
 thickness, place approximately 1/2 of each day's production in one lane and
 the remainder in the adjacent lane unless an approved notched wedge device
 is used.
 Protect pavement from traffic until it has sufficiently hardened to the
 extent the surface is not damaged.
 502.08.2 Paving Operations: When placing the final two lifts of
 asphalt concrete on the roadway travel lanes, use a material transfer vehicle
 (MTV) as described in 503.14. During continuous paving, maintain
 temperature of the mixture constant. At no time shall there be more than
 50°F difference in temperature as measured in 300 linear feet of paving or
 25°F across the full paved width. All mixtures shall flow through the paver
 hopper. Lift into the hopper any mixture dropped in front of the paver or
 reject such material and cast it aside. Deliver material to the paver at a
 uniform rate and in an amount within the capacity of paving and compacting
 equipment. Adjust the paver speed and number of trucks to maintain one
 truck waiting in addition to the one at the paver in order to maintain
 continuous paving operations. Maintain a uniform height of material in front
 of the screed.
 Keep the paver steady and in constant alignment during mix transfer.
 Maintain a level of mix higher than the paver hopper feed slats at all times.
 Use pavers and operators capable of placing mixtures to required line, grade
 and surface tolerance without resorting to hand finishing.
 Construct longitudinal joints and edges along established lines. Utilize
 some form of longitudinal control for the paver to follow, preferably a string
 line. Position and operate the paver to closely follow the established line.
 Correct irregularities in alignment by trimming or filling directly behind the
 paver. Check the texture for uniformity after each load of material has been
 placed. Check the adjustment of screed, feed screws, hopper feed, etc.,
 frequently and adjust as required to assure uniform spreading of the mix to
 proper line and grade and adequate compaction. When segregation of
 materials or other deficiencies occur, suspend paving operations until the
 cause is determined and corrected.
 
 247
 
 Correct surface irregularities directly behind the paver. Hand placement
 will be allowed in accordance with 502.08.3 for surface repair, taking care
 never to cast material over the fresh surface.
 Discontinue paving operations when any screed control device
 malfunctions during binder or wearing course placement operations. When
 malfunctions occur, limit material through the paver to that which is in
 transit. Assume responsibility of meeting all specifications and yield
 requirements, and bear the cost of any overrun during malfunctions. Do not
 resume paving operations until the malfunction is fixed.
 When paving operations are interrupted, remove and replace at no direct
 pay, mixture that has cooled below the point that it cannot be finished, or
 compacted to meet specifications.
 When additional mix is required to
 increase superelevation in curves, the use of automatic slope control is
 optional. However, ensure slope by measuring with a slope board. Allow
 the engineer use of the slope board upon request.
 Use the traveling reference plane method of construction for airport
 runways unless designated otherwise on the plans. Unless the erected string
 line is required or directed, use the 27-foot (minimum) traveling reference
 plane method of construction for roadway travel lanes. The requirements
 of 502.08.2.1, 502.08.2.2, and 502.08.2.3 shall apply for mechanical pavers.
 502.08.2.1 Traveling Reference Plane: Obtain approval of the
 traveling reference plane method before use. After the initial paving strip of
 each lift is finished and compacted, place adjacent paving strips to the grade
 of the initial paving strip using the traveling reference plane or shoe device
 to control grade and a slope control device to control cross slope.
 On multilane pavements, the initial paving strip and the sequence of lane
 construction will be subject to approval.
 When both outside edges of the paving strip being placed are flush with
 previously placed material, do not use the slope control device. A grade
 sensor is required for each side of the paver.
 In superelevated curves, the cross slope shall be changed from that
 specified for tangents to that specified for superelevation in gradual
 increments while the paver is in motion so a smooth transition in grade is
 obtained. This change in cross slope shall be accomplished within the
 transition distance specified.
 This is the minimum acceptable method and the contractor must meet or
 exceed current surface tolerance specifications.
 502.08.2.2 Erected Stringline: Use the erected stringline
 method in isolated areas as directed by the engineer. This method may be
 used on the first lift of asphalt when the underlying new or reconstructed
 248
 
 bases do not have grade control requirements. Equip pavers for roadway
 travel lanes with automatic screed and slope control devices when used with
 an erected stringline.
 An erected stringline shall consist of a piano wire or approved equal
 stretched between stakes set at no greater than 25-foot intervals. Tension the
 stringline between supports so that there is less than 1/8 inch variance
 between supports when the sensor is in place. If required, place the initial
 paving strip of the first lift constructed using an erected stringline referenced
 to established grade. When permitted, mixtures required to level isolated
 depressions may be placed without automatic screed control. Subsequent
 lifts may be constructed by use of the traveling reference plane, provided
 surface and grade tolerances are met on the previous lift.
 Only one grade sensor and the slope control device are necessary for
 roadways with a normal crown on tangent alignment. Superelevated curves
 will require the use of two grade sensors and two erected stringlines to obtain
 proper grade and slope; however, when the automatic screed control device
 is equipped with a dial or other device which can be conveniently used to
 change the cross slope in small increments, superelevated curves may be
 constructed using this device and one erected stringline.
 After the initial paving strip of the first lift is finished and compacted, lay
 adjacent paving strips using an approved traveling reference plane.
 502.08.2.3 Without Automatic Screed Control: When
 permitted, pavers without automatic screed control may be used for
 pavement patching, pavement widening, paved drives and turnouts.
 502.08.3 Hand Placement: When the use of mechanical finishing
 equipment is not practical, the mix may be placed and finished by hand to
 the satisfaction of the engineer. During paving operations, material shall be
 thoroughly loosened and uniformly distributed. Material that has formed
 into lumps and does not break down readily will be rejected. Check the
 surface before rolling and correct irregularities.
 502.09 ROLLING AND COMPACTION.
 502.09.1 General: After placement, uniformly compact mixture by
 rolling while still hot, to a density that complies with Table 502-5. If
 continuous roller operation is discontinued, move rollers to cooler areas of
 the mat where they will not leave surface indentations. The use of steel
 wheel rollers in the vibratory mode, which result in excessive crushing of
 aggregate, will not be permitted.
 Utilize experienced operators when rolling the mixture using consistent
 rolling sequences and uniform methods to achieve specified density and
 
 249
 
 smoothness. Uniformly overlap preceding passes of individual roller passes
 to ensure complete coverage of the paving area. Do not tear or crack the mat
 by varying the roller speed, amplitude, vibration frequency or other roller
 operation. Operate non-vibrating steel wheel rollers with drive wheels
 toward the paver. Correct any operation causing displacement, tearing or
 cracking of the mat.
 Prohibit use of equipment, which leaves tracks or indented areas that
 cannot be corrected in normal operations or fails to produce a satisfactory
 surface. Stop use of equipment resulting in accumulation of material and
 subsequent shedding of accumulated material into the mixture or onto the
 mat.
 Keep rollers of steel wheel rollers properly moistened without excess
 water to prevent adhesion of mixture to rollers.
 Maintain adequate heat for pneumatic tire rollers to prevent mix from
 adhering to tires. Operate the pneumatic tire roller at a contact pressure
 which will result in a uniform, tightly knit surface. Keep the pneumatic tire
 roller approximately 6 inches from unsupported edges of the paving strip;
 however, when an adjacent paving strip is down, overlap the adjacent paving
 strip approximately 6 inches.
 Vibratory rollers may be used provided they do not impair the stability of
 the pavement structure or underlying layers. Vibratory rollers shall not be
 used on the first lift of asphalt concrete placed over the asphalt treated
 drainage blanket. When mix is placed on newly constructed cement or lime
 stabilized or treated layers, do not use vibratory rollers until base is approved
 by the engineer and not for at least 5 days after such stabilization or
 treatment.
 It is the responsibility of the contractor to determine the number, size, and
 type of rollers to sufficiently compact the mixture to the specified density
 and surface smoothness. Ensure that the rolling equipment is capable of
 maintaining the pace of the paver and conforms to 503.16.
 The surface of mixtures after compaction shall be smooth and true to
 cross slope and grade within the tolerances specified. Remove mixtures that
 become loose, broken, contaminated or otherwise defective and replace with
 fresh hot mixture compacted to conform to the surrounding mixture.
 Excessive rippling of the mat surface will not be accepted. Ripples are
 small bumps in the pavement surface which usually appear in groups in a
 frequent and regular manner. No more than 12 ripples or peaks will be
 allowed in any 100-foot section. Rippling indicates a problem with the
 paving operation or mix that requires immediate corrective action by the
 250
 
 contractor; otherwise cease operations. Correct unacceptable areas at no
 direct pay.
 After rolling, ensure that newly finished pavements have a uniform,
 tightly knit surface free of cracks, tears, roller marks or other deficiencies.
 Correct deficiencies at no direct pay and adjust operations to correct the
 problem. This may require the contractor to adjust the mix or furnish
 additional or different equipment.
 502.09.2
 Hand Compaction: Along forms, curbs, headers, walls
 and at other places inaccessible to rollers, compact the mixture uniformly to
 the satisfaction of the engineer with approved hand tampers or mechanical
 tampers, conforming to 503.17.
 502.10 ROADWAY LOT SIZES. A roadway lot is determined as mix
 placed consecutively on the project from a specific JMF.
 502.10.1 Mainline Mix Lot Sizes:
 The mainline sublot size is 7500 linear lane feet; the mainline lot is five
 sublots or 37,500 linear lane feet. Any project with less than 37,500 linear
 lane feet for any mix type is also defined as a lot. The final mainline lot
 size may be extended one sublot with the approval of the engineer.
 502.10.2 Minor Mix:
 Minor mix lots will be defined as 1000 tons delivered to the project by
 mix type. The following types should be kept in separate lots.
 502.10.2.2 Minor Lots with Density Requirement: Minor
 mix lots with density requirements are 1000 tons. These include bike
 paths, crossovers, detour roads, parking lots, patching, widening, uniform
 leveling thicker than 1.5 inches, tapers, and shoulders paved independently
 which are less than 8 feet wide.
 502.10.2.3 Minor Lots without Density Requirement:
 Minor mix lots such as curbs, driveways, guardrail widening, islands, joint
 repair, spot leveling, medians, turnouts and < 4 feet shoulder paved with the
 mainline do not have density requirements. Make compaction effort to the
 satisfaction of the engineer. Lots are 1000 tons.
 For projects, or separate locations within a project, requiring less than
 250 tons, the JMF, materials, and plant and paving operations shall be
 satisfactory to the engineer. Sampling and testing requirements may be
 modified by the engineer and the payment adjustment for deviations waived.
 502.11 ROADWAY ACCEPTANCE. Acceptance testing for pavement
 density and dimensional tolerances will be conducted on that portion of the
 
 251
 
 lot placed on each contract. Acceptance testing for surface tolerance will be
 conducted upon completion of mainline paving.
 Do not place asphalt concrete mixture exhibiting deficiencies such as
 segregation, contamination, lumps, non-uniform coating, excessive
 temperature variations, or other deficiencies apparent on visual inspection.
 Correct and/or replace at no direct pay any asphalt concrete mix
 exhibiting deficiencies, such as segregation, contamination, alignment
 deviations, variations in surface texture and appearance or other deficiencies,
 apparent on visual inspection. Poor construction practices such as handwork,
 improper truck exchanges, improper joint construction, or other deficiencies,
 apparent on visual inspection, will be corrected at no direct pay.
 502.11.1 Density: Obtain pavement samples from each sublot within
 24 hours after placement. When this falls on a day the contractor is not
 working, sampling will be done within 3 calendar days. Sample at
 locations determined by the PE using random number tables shown in
 DOTD S605.
 When the sampling location determined by random sampling falls within
 areas that are to be replaced or within 18 inches of the unsupported
 pavement edge, another random sampling location will be used.
 T a k e cores, approximately 6 inches in diameter, with an approved core
 drill. Furnish samples cut from the completed work. Replace removed
 pavement with hot or cold mixture and refinished during the work day coring
 is performed at no additional pay. Sample in the presence of the engineer’s
 representative. Do not use cores less than 1 3/8 inches thick fo r payment
 determination. For transport by parties other than DOTD representatives,
 ensure that the cores are individually wrapped, sealed, signed, and dated by
 the DOTD inspector or representative using an approved method. Any
 evidence of tampering with the core will result in the cores being rejected
 and additional pavement samples being required.
 The engineer or his representative will transport cores in approved
 transport containers. When allowed, the contractor or third party will
 transport in an approved, locked transport container.
 Divide the 7500-linear-lane-foot sublot into three segments of 2500 linear
 feet each. Obtain one acceptance core from each segment for a total of three
 cores. Take a verification core randomly from the 7500-linear-foot sublot.
 Take a resolution core randomly from the 7500-linear-foot sublot. There are
 five 7500-foot sublots for each 37,500 linear foot lot. For each lot, there are
 a total of 15 acceptance cores, 5 verification cores and 5 resolution cores.
 For project lots between 2500 and 5000 linear feet, take two acceptance
 cores per sublot. Projects having less than 2500 linear feet will require 3
 252
 
 cores. Sampling for projects with less than 250 tons may be modified by the
 Project Engineer.
 502.11.1.1 Testing of Roadway Cores (Method 1): The
 District Laboratory will calculate the density of each acceptance roadway
 core using the Gmb of the core and the representative maximum specific
 gravity, Gmm, in accordance with 502.05.
 The density requirement for each lot is s h o w n in Table 502-5.
 Cores will be retained for a period of 10 days after density is reported.
 502.11.1.2 Testing of Roadway Cores (Method 2)
 Contractor’s Testing of Roadway Cores in Acceptance Decision:
 With proven plant production consistency, and when recommended by
 the District Laboratory Engineer and approved by the Materials Engineer,
 contractor may request to be allowed to sample and test roadway cores for
 acceptance at no cost to the Department in lieu of District Laboratory
 acceptance testing. Density calculations for each acceptance roadway and
 verification core will utilize the Gmb of the core and the representative
 maximum specific gravity, Gmm as determined in accordance with 502.05.
 Refer to 502.11.1 for core responsibility. The District Laboratory roadway
 lot verification will be based on a means comparison between the District
 Laboratory verification average and the contractor acceptance average for
 each lot. If the means comparison produces a difference, use the resolution
 cores for pay determination. The Department will send the resolution cores
 to a certified Independent Assurance (IA) laboratory to determine pay in
 accordance with 502.11.1.5.
 For Method 2: The plant production consistency will be determined as
 follows: The Department will continuously monitor plant data and roadway
 data by JMF, by plant, by contractor. Plant data will be monitored in
 accordance with 502.06. Roadway data will be monitored using statistical
 methods comparing means and variances (F and t) tests. Continued use of
 Method 2 is allowed unless the plant or roadway data fail to verify with data
 set of a minimum of 45 contractor acceptance tests and 15 DOTD
 verification tests results, and it is determined by the DLE and Independent
 Assurance team that the contractor’s production data meets requirements.
 If the F and t test fail an investigation shall be conducted by the IA team.
 If the contractor data after F and t analysis is performed and is found to be
 error, DOTD acceptance testing of roadway cores will resume and
 independent accredited laboratory could be required for plant testing at no
 cost to the Department until such time as the problem is identified and
 resolved.
 
 253
 
 502.11.1.3 “Minor with Density” Requirements: For Method
 1: When density is specified in Table 502-5, the roadway inspector will
 identify core locations to be cut by the contractor. The District Laboratory
 will test three cores for density every 1000 tons per mix type placed per
 roadway sampling procedure mentioned above and pay in accordance with
 Table 502-7. The District Laboratory will calculate the density of each
 roadway core using the Gmb of the core and the representative maximum
 specific gravity, Gmm, in accordance with 502.05. For Method 2: The
 contractor will perform acceptance test per above method. Table 502-7 is
 used to compute pay.
 502.11.1.4 Minor Mix without Density: This minor mix shall
 have a neat, uniform appearance and be compacted by methods to the
 satisfaction of the engineer. Collect one loose mix specimen, from roadway,
 per project, for Gmm verification.
 502.11.1.5 Verification: One core will be selected every 7500
 linear lane feet and will be evaluated by either Method 1 or Method 2 in
 accordance with 502.11.1.1.
 502.11.1.6 Resolution: One core from each 7500 linear lane feet
 of placed mix will be chosen at random and will be double sealed, signed by
 both contractor and Department’s certified inspectors in accordance with the
 Quality Assurance Manual as required or for documentation. The resolution
 core will be tested at a certified IA laboratory as described in the QA manual.
 502.12 SURFACE TOLERANCE EQUIPMENT, QUALITY
 CONTROL, ACCEPTANCE, MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 ADJUSTMENT. Measure the top two lifts of the mainline travel lanes with
 an approved inertial profiler. Maintain record of intermediate measures of
 smoothness quality as described herein. Final acceptance will be based on
 the last measurement taken on the final wearing course of the travel lanes.
 Measurement of the center two lanes will be required for airports.
 Constantly monitor equipment, materials, and processes to ensure that
 surface tolerance requirements are met.
 502.12.1 Equipment: For longitudinal surface tolerance quality
 control testing and acceptance testing on mainline wearing and binder
 courses, furnish and use a DOTD certified inertial profiler. Certified profilers
 will have a DOTD decal indicating the date of certification and profiler
 system parameter settings. Measure longitudinal surface profile in inches
 per mile in accordance with DOTD TR 644 and report as the International
 Roughness Index (IRI).
 254
 
 Verify the profiler system parameter settings before each run.
 Demonstrate the daily set up procedure and pre-operation tests in accordance
 with the manufacturer's procedures and DOTD TR 644. Ensure that a copy
 of the manufacturer's setup, pre-operation, and general operating procedures
 for measuring surface tolerance are available at all times during
 measurement.
 For transverse quality control testing and for longitudinal quality control
 testing for wearing course on bike paths, detour roads, parking lots, and
 shoulders; furnish and use an approved 10-foot metal static straight-edge and
 electronic or static level.
 Profiler system parameter settings shall be verified before and during
 each run by the DOTD inspector. For transverse, cross slope and grade
 testing, furnish a 10-foot metal static straightedge and electronic or static
 level for Department use.
 502.12.2 Longitudinal Smoothness Quality Control: Within
 7 calendar days of placement, for mainline wearing and binder courses, run
 the certified profiler. View the raw data with ProVAL to determine IRI and
 to view Profilograph Simulation for each wheelpath. Make corrections to
 operation and/or mixture to ensure that the overall ride and individual bump
 requirements are met. Correct all individual bumps which are more than 1/4
 inch as identified on Profilograph Simulation or when tested with a 10-foot
 metal static straightedge. Ensure that the following quality requirements are
 met:
 1. Produce IRI which meets the requirements for 100 percent pay in
 accordance with Table 502-8. Continued surface tolerance penalties are not
 allowed.
 2. Correct all individual bumps which are more than 1/4 inch when
 tested with a 10-foot metal static straightedge. Utilize the Profilograph
 Simulation on ProVAL to help identify these bumps.
 3. Correct ripples to the satisfaction of the engineer. Report
 Profilograph Simulation for areas with 12 or more small, regular bumps in a
 100-foot section or for any areas in question.
 Minor mixes shall comply with Table 502-5. For minor mixes, use the
 10-foot metal static straightedge to check for conformance to specifications.
 502.12.3 Transverse Smoothness, Cross Slope, and Grade:
 The Department will test the surface of the binder and wearing courses at
 selected locations for conformance to the surface tolerance requirements of
 this subsection and Table 502-5. Make corrections as directed in accordance
 with 502.12.4.
 
 255
 
 502.12.3.1 Transverse Smoothness: Areas with surface
 deviations in excess of specification limits shall be isolated and corrected in
 accordance with 502.12.4. Control the transverse surface finish.
 502.12.3.2 Cross Slope: When the plans require the section to be
 constructed to a specified cross slope, take measurements at selected
 locations using a stringline, a slope board, an electronic or static level
 mounted on a 10-foot metal static straightedge, or other comparable device.
 Control the cross slope for each lane to comply with the tolerances shown in
 Table 502-5. Make corrections in accordance with 502.12.4.
 502.12.3.3 Grade: When the plans require the pavement to be
 constructed to a specified profile grade, test for conformance at selected
 locations, using a stringline or other comparable device. Control grade
 variations so that the tolerances shown in Table 502-5 are not exceeded.
 Grade tolerances shall apply to only one longitudinal line, such as the
 centerline or outside edge of pavement. Make corrections in accordance
 with 502.12.4.
 502.12.4 Correction of Deficient Areas: Correct areas as
 required in 502.12.2 and those not meeting Table 502-5, and Table 502-8.
 Correct wearing and binder courses by grinding. In lieu of grinding, the
 Project Engineer may penalize the contractor $800 per area of small
 individual bumps, and/or per “Ripple” as defined in 502.12.2.
 502.12.4.1 Deficiencies in Mainline Wearing Course: Correct
 deficiencies in the final wearing course by removing and replacing mixture,
 or by diamond grinding or other approved device across the lane and
 applying a light tack coat, or by furnishing and placing a supplemental layer
 of wearing course mixture at least 1 1/2 inches compacted thickness for the
 full width of the roadway meeting specification requirements at no direct
 pay. If the supplemental layer does not meet specification requirements to
 the satisfaction of the engineer, remove and replace or correct it by other
 methods approved by the engineer.
 For areas that will not be improved by grinding such as minor dips,
 extreme vertical curves, areas with < 1/4 inch bump as measured with a 10
 feet metal static straight edge, the engineer may waive the requirement to
 grind.
 502.12.4.2 Deficiencies in Mainline Binder Courses:
 Correct deficiencies in binder course: longitudinal, transverse, cross slope,
 and grade to meet specification requirements at no direct pay. Make
 corrections before subsequent courses are constructed.
 
 256
 
 502.12.4.3 Deficiencies in Minor Mixes: Correct deficiencies
 in minor mixes by diamond grinding or approved method at the project
 engineer’s direction.
 502.12.5 Surface Tolerance Acceptance: Measure the top two
 lifts of the mainline travel lanes with an approved inertial profiler. Final
 acceptance will be based on the last measurement taken on the final wearing
 course of the travel lanes. Measurement of the center two lanes will be
 required for airports.
 502.12.5.1 Longitudinal Surface Tolerance Acceptance:
 Measure surface tolerance at the completion of the project and after all
 corrections have been made or at an approved portion of the project in
 accordance with 502.12.2. Measure the mainline wearing course
 continuously from start to finish in the direction of travel. The measurement
 shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of a Department
 representative. The measurement may also be made by the Materials and
 Testing Section, or by a private company approved by the Department.
 Report one IRI measurement in inches per mile for the entire project. A standalone pay adjustment factor will be determined in accordance with 502.15.
 Place a start and stop mark at the beginning and end of each travel lane
 so that measurements can be rerun by the Department if needed. Interim
 measurements of a portion may be allowed, with approval of the engineer, as
 follows:
 1. For partial acceptance in accordance with 105.17.1.
 2. Due to phasing or sequence of construction, this measurement may
 result in 100 percent pay or less. However, payment exceeding 100 percent
 for this section of roadway will only be allowed if the smoothness remeasured at the completion of the project meets the requirements of Table
 502-8.
 3. For an unavoidable lengthy delay, apply the same payment criteria
 as No. 2 above.
 The mainline longitudinal surface tolerance IRI specification
 requirements are shown in Table 502-8. Perform profiler testing and submit
 data to the engineer before starting paving operations. To ensure that the
 contractor has corrected deficiencies, the Department will spot check for 1/4
 inch bumps in accordance with 502.12.2. Although grinding may be waived
 by the engineer, the measured roughness will still contribute to the total IRI
 for the project.
 A DOTD inspector will be present for the final test run and will
 immediately receive a copy of the raw data, the “.erd file” and any files with
 information about the project, the operator, the equipment, the settings, daily
 
 257
 
 pre-operation results, and a copy of the IRI results via USB flash drive
 provided by the contractor. In addition to the data transferred by USB storage
 device, provide to the engineer a paper copy of the IRI report. Acceptance
 for the project will be in accordance with Tables 502-8, based on the data.
 The Department may elect to perform and utilize independent ride quality
 test results for acceptance at any time.
 502.12.5.2 Exclusions: The final IRI measurement shall be taken
 in entirety, without exclusions. The Department will then review the profile
 report obtained for each lane of the mainline wearing course. In special cases
 or extenuating circumstances, the engineer may isolate or exclude sections
 of the profile. These include the following:
 1. Bridge ends, and sections that are within 150 feet of bridge ends.
 2. Outside wheelpath of curb and gutter sections that require
 adjustment in order to maintain adequate drainage.
 3. Manholes, catch basins, valve and junction boxes.
 4. Street intersections or rail road crossings of a different grade.
 5. Structures located in the roadway which cause abrupt deviations in
 the profile.
 6.Transitions to and from ramps and turn lanes and sections within
 200ft of the limits of the project if the limits begin or end at an intersection.
 7. Sections where the project engineer determines that attaining
 smoothness is beyond the contractor’s reasonable control.
 Exclusions will not be used to simply isolate sections of road that are in
 poor condition when the project is let. The roughness in excluded areas will
 not be included in the total IRI used for payment purposes, but shall meet the
 requirements of 502.12.2. The quantity of asphalt represented by the length
 excluded will not receive a pay adjustment for surface tolerance.
 502.12.6 Surface Tolerance Measurement: Measure and report
 the average IRI of each wheel path of each mainline lane in inches per mile
 and reach mainline lane prorated for the entire project.
 
 258
 
 The theoretical quantity is computed by using the total length of lanes,
 the plan thickness, and the plan width, excluding shoulders and minor mixes.
 Adjust the tons as necessary affected represented for each mainline travel
 lane.
 502.12.7 Payment Adjustment for Surface Tolerance: Apply a
 percent payment adjustment for the quantity of tons represented in each land
 of the mainline wearing course. This pay adjustment is in addition to pay
 adjustments for density as described in 502.15.2. For mainline wearing
 course, a separate pay adjustment for surface tolerance measured on the
 mainline wearing course based on Table 502-8 shall apply. Apply the
 adjustment to the theoretical lane quantity and contract unit price.
 502.13 DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS. Ensure that mixtures
 conform to the following dimensional requirements only. No other
 acceptance tests will be required for these mixtures. Over-thickness and
 over-width will be accepted at no direct pay.
 502.13.1 Thickness: For mixture specified for payment on cubic yard
 or square yard basis, thickness of mixtures will be determined by the
 Department in accordance with DOTD TR 602. Under-thickness shall not
 exceed 1/4 inch.
 Correct area under-thickness in excess of 1/4 inch to plan thickness at no
 direct pay. Furnishing and placing additional mixture in accordance with
 502.12.4.1. Correct excesses of 1/2 inch for category D, Table 502-8. When
 grade adjustments do not permit placing additional mixture, remove the
 deficient under-thickness area and replace at no additional pay.
 For mixtures specified for payment on a per ton basis, thickness of
 mixtures will be determined by the plans, Table 502-6, and that agreed to
 with the Project Engineer. Under thickness shall not exceed 1/2 inch.
 Removal and replacement of deficient under-thickness area(s) or other
 approved remediation agreed to by the Project Engineer will be at no direct
 pay.
 502.13.2 Width: The width of completed courses will be determined
 in accordance with DOTD TR 602. Correct under-widths by furnishing and
 placing additional mixture to a minimum width of 1 foot and plan thickness
 at no direct pay.
 502.14 MEASUREMENT. Measure asphalt concrete by the ton of 2,000
 pounds from printed weights as provided in Section 503. Provide stamped
 printer tickets with each truckload of material delivered denoting JMF
 
 259
 
 number and plant tonnage. Material lost, wasted, rejected or applied
 contrary to specifications will not be measured for payment.
 Estimated quantities of asphalt concrete shown on the plans are based on
 110 lb/sq yd/inch thickness. The measured quantity of asphalt mixtures will
 be multiplied by the following adjustment factors to obtain the pay quantity.
 Theoretical Maximum Specific

 502.14.1 Volume or Area Measurement: The quantities for
 payment will be the design quantities specified in the plans and adjustments
 thereto. Design quantities will be adjusted when the engineer makes changes
 to adjust the field conditions or when design changes are necessary. Design
 quantities are based on the horizontal dimensions and compacted thickness
 of the completed course shown on the plans.

 502.15 PAYMENT.
 502.15.1 Payment General. Payment for all mixes will be at the
 contract unit price of asphalt mixture accepted on the roadway. Payment for
 asphalt concrete will include furnishing all required materials, producing the
 mixtures, preparing the surfaces on which the mixtures are placed, hauling
 the mixtures to the work site, and placing and compacting the mixtures.
 When the mix does not meet requirements, payment adjustments shall be
 assessed. Production of mix that is not eligible for 100 percent payment will
 not be allowed on a continuous basis. When test results demonstrate that
 payment adjustments are necessary, satisfactory mixture and compaction
 adjustments shall be made, or production shall be discontinued. All
 calculations for percent payment adjustments will be rounded to the nearest
 one (1) percent. Payment for removal of pavement markings will be in
 accordance with the applicable item. Payment adjustments will be
 determined in accordance with 502.14 and the QA Manual.
 502.15.2
 Mainline Mixtures. For all mainline mixtures,
 adjustments in contract unit price for roadway density as required by Table
 502-5 and will be based on PWL using Tables 502-9 and 502-10 for all
 acceptance cores in the lot. This payment adjustment will be applied to the
 theoretical mainline lane quantity and contract unit price.
 In addition, for mainline wearing course, a separate pay adjustment for
 surface tolerance based on Table 502-8 shall apply for all travel lanes based
 on the theoretical mainline lane quantity and contract unit price.
 The theoretical quantity is computed by using the plan width, the plan
 thickness, and the total length of travel lanes, without exclusion areas.
 502.15.3 Minor Mixtures.
 502.15.3.1 Minor Shoulder Lots, > 4 Feet Wide. Adjustments
 in contract price for shoulder density will be based on the average density
 for all cores in the lot and Table 502-5.
 502.15.3.2 Minor Lots with Density. Adjustments in contract
 price will be based on the core density for each lot in accordance with Table
 502-7.
 502.15.4 Payment for Tack. Tack coat as required in 502.07.2.2
 “Applying Tack Coat” will be considered incidental to the 502 item. If the
 engineer adjusts the application rate of tack coat from that specified by the
 contract document, payment for the asphalt mixture will be increased or
 decreased based on the difference in the applied quantity of asphalt emulsion
 shown on paid invoices (total of charges). The contractor shall provide
 copies of paid invoices for this determination. Apply 95 percent payment to
 
 261
 
 the 502 item when the tack coat rates do not meet the application rate as
 allow by the engineer.
 502.15.5 Payment Adjustment for Asphalt Cement. A minimum
 payment adjustments of 10 percent of the 502 item will apply to mixtures
 that do not meet specification but are within one grade of the specification.
 Asphalt that exceeds one lower grade difference in specification will be
 subject to 50 percent payment reduction or removal at the discretion of the
 Chief Engineer.
 502.15.6 Payment Adjustment for Surface Tolerance.
 Payment adjustment will be in accordance with 502.12.7
 Apply a percent payment adjustment for quantity of tons represented in each
 lane of the mainline wearing course. This pay adjustment is in addition to
 the pay adjustments for density as described in 502.15.2. For mainline
 wearing course, a separate pay adjustment for surface tolerance measured on
 the mainline wearing course based on Table 502-8 shall apply. Apply the
 adjustment to the theoretical lane quantity and contract unit price.
 502.15.7 Payment for Erected Stringline. When the use of an
 erected stringline is not specified, but directed by the engineer, an additional
 payment of $3500 per contract plus $0.25 per linear foot will be made for
 mixtures placed by the erected stringline method. When the use of an erected
 stringline is specified, no additional payment will be made.
 Payment will be made under:

 Section 503
 Asphalt Concrete Equipment and Processes
 503.01 DESCRIPTION. This section specifies requirements for the
 certification of asphalt concrete plants and paving equipment. It includes
 methods and equipment for handling and storing materials, producing
 asphalt concrete, and transporting and placing asphalt concrete at the job site.
 The Department's publication entitled “Application of Quality Assurance
 Specifications for Asphalt Concrete Mixtures” is hereby made a part of this
 specification by reference.
 503.02 PLANT EQUIPMENT.
 503.02.1 General: Provide equipment and processes to proportion
 aggregates, additives and asphalt cement in accordance with the approved
 Job Mix Formula (JMF). When the automatic adjustments or other critical
 control and shutoff devices are not functioning, do not operate the plant.
 Operate the plant with clean, easily accessible, and accurate thermometers,
 scales and meters. Immediately repair, replace, or recalibrate equipment
 when faulty operation is detected.
 Provide a system with positive weight control of cold aggregates fed by
 a belt scale or other device interlocked with the asphalt measuring system to
 maintain required proportions of combined aggregates and asphalt cement.
 Heat, dry and mix aggregates with asphalt cement to produce a homogeneous
 mixture in which all aggregate particles are uniformly coated. Use approved
 methods to discard the first and last output of the plant after each
 interruption. Place discarded material in a separate dedicated area.
 Digitally display the total quantities and the rates of production of every
 material used on a DOTD project.
 503.02.2 Certification and Calibrations: The Department will
 certify plants furnishing asphalt mixtures every two years with current
 Departmental procedures or when any major component is repaired, replaced
 or upgraded. The plant owner is required to report any major component
 upgrades to the District Laboratory Engineer. Forward all documentation
 available upon request by the Department. All plant components and
 processes are subject at any time to inspection and approval by the District
 Laboratory Engineer. The plant owner is required every 90 days to have the
 laboratory gram scales, ignition oven scales, truck platform scales, and
 weight batchers tested, inspected, and calibrated by a qualified independent
 
 271
 
 scale service or the Weights and Measures Division, Louisiana Department
 of Agriculture and Forestry.
 Within 10 working days of the 90 days plant scale recalibration, the
 Certified Asphalt Concrete Plant Technician, in accordance with 503.09, will
 verify calibration of the plant’s cold feed bins, RAP feed bins, weight
 bridges, asphalt pump, and additives measuring devices to stated DOTD
 standards. The Certified Asphalt Concrete Plant Technician shall notify the
 DOTD certifying District Laboratory two days prior to plant calibration.
 Provide a plant site laboratory conforming to 722.02 as a part of the plant
 facilities at no direct pay, except as modified herein. Each plant laboratory
 shall have a minimum floor space of 400 square feet. Laboratories are to be
 provided for all Quality Assurance testing. Calibrate, verify and document
 all laboratory equipment according to the procedures, test methods, and
 frequency in accordance with the current “LADOTD Laboratory Equipment
 Manual.”
 503.03 AGGREGATES.
 503.03.1 Stockpiles: Store aggregates at the plant site so that no
 intermixing, segregation, pooling of water or contamination will occur.
 Ensure that gradation and other properties of aggregate in stockpiles are
 combined in proper proportions so that the resulting combined gradation will
 meet the requirements of the approved JMF.
 503.03.2 Cold Feed Bins: Blend and proportion all aggregates in cold
 feed bins.

 Asphalt Surface Treatment
 507.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of furnishing properly
 distributed asphalt material followed by a uniform application of aggregate
 for building a riding surface, improving the surface friction of a roadway,
 sealing cracks in the roadway, reducing the rate of oxidation of a surface
 mixture, or as an interlayer to delay or reduce the occurrence of reflective
 cracking.
 Asphalt Surface Treatment (AST), sometimes referred to as “chip seal,”
 consists of a specified emulsion applied “cold” or polymer modified asphalt
 material applied “hot,” at the temperature range specified in Table 507-1 for
 cold applications or Table 507-2 for hot applications, respectively. The
 application rates of asphalt material and aggregates will vary with aggregate
 size and existing roadway conditions but, for bid purposes only, shall meet
 the requirements of Table 507-1 or Table 507-2. The engineer will review
 the actual application rates.
 507.02 MATERIALS.
 507.02.1 Asphalt: Use asphalt materials complying with Section 1002
 that are Approved Material List products. Comply with Table 507-1 or 5072.
 Take samples of asphalt material in the presence of the engineer's
 representative. The engineer's representative will immediately take
 possession of the samples.
 507.02.2 Aggregates: Aggregates shall comply with 1003.07 and
 Table 1003-15. Use Approved Material List aggregates shown herein or as
 designated on the plans.
 For hot applications and interlayer applications, precoat aggregates with
 a paving grade asphalt cement or a cationic emulsion. For precoated
 aggregates, the residual asphalt content shall be a minimum of 1.4 percent
 by weight of the aggregate for high absorption aggregates and 0.5 percent
 minimum by weight for low absorption aggregates as defined in AASHTO
 T84. The precoat applicator shall certify the quantities of precoat used in the
 process. Ensure that the precoated aggregate flows freely. The gradation
 requirements apply to the aggregate after precoating. Submit a gradation
 Certificate of Analysis with each aggregate shipment of 1000 cubic. yards or
 each project, whichever is less. If an emulsion is used for precoating, cure
 the stockpiled precoated aggregate prior to use.
 290
 
 507.03 EQUIPMENT. Provide asphalt distributors, pneumatic tire
 rollers, power brooms or blowers, aggregate spreaders, and vacuum
 sweepers in accordance with Section 503. Calibrate and maintain the
 necessary equipment for proper construction.
 Keep storage tanks, piping, booster tanks, distributors, and all other
 equipment used in delivering, storing, or handling asphalt materials clean
 and in good operating condition.
 507.03.1 Power Asphalt Distributor: Provide a computer operated
 asphalt distributor in accordance with 503.13.1.
 507.03.2 Pneumatic-tire Rollers: Use self-propelled rollers,
 weighing at least 12 tons each in accordance with 503.16.4.1
 507.03.3 Power Broom or Blower: Use a power revolving broom
 or power blower in accordance with 503.16.4.2.
 507.03.4 Aggregate Spreader: Use a self-propelled, pneumatic tire
 power spreader in accordance with 503. 16.4.3.
 507.03.5 Vacuum-Sweeper: Provide a vacuum-sweeper when there
 is a dusting problem in accordance with 503.16.4.4.
 507.03.6 Haul Trucks: Provide haul trucks in accordance with 503.11.
 507.04 WEATHER LIMITATIONS. Do not apply AST if any of the
 following conditions occur:
 1. Wet or moist surface. Consider the pavement to be excessively moist
 when it is visibly wet or when a one square foot piece of polyethylene
 film condenses moisture after being tightly placed on the pavement
 surface for 15 minutes;
 2. Rain has occurred within 24 hours (for hot applied AST only);
 3. The air temperature or pavement surface temperature in the shade is
 less than 60°F; or
 4. The air temperature is predicted by the National Weather Service to
 fall below 60°F within 24 hours after placement.
 507.05 PREPARATION OF EXISTING SURFACE. Potholes and
 surface depressions will be repaired by the Department prior to the asphalt
 surface treatment work unless shown otherwise on the plans.
 Prepare existing surface at no direct pay unless otherwise specified on the
 plans. Immediately prior to application of the asphalt material, clean and degrass existing pavements over the full width to be treated. Remove raised
 pavement markers at no direct pay. Sweep the pavement with a power
 broom or blower to remove all loose material. Clean areas not reached by
 the power broom or blower by hand brooming or blowing.
 291
 
 If used, ensure that the prime coat or curing membrane, is satisfactorily
 cured and maintained in accordance with Sections 505 and 506 prior to
 application of AST.
 Obtain the engineer’s acceptance of the surface prior to application of
 AST.
 507.06 APPLICATION. After the existing surface has been properly
 prepared, apply asphalt material and aggregates in the amounts determined
 by the contractor and accepted by the engineer, and in the sequence specified
 herein.
 Apply and spread asphalt surfacing at the temperatures and sequences
 given in Table 507-1 or 507-2. The quantities of material given in Table
 507-1 or 507-2 may be adjusted by the engineer as field conditions warrant.
 The type and condition of the surface being covered will affect the required
 application rate of asphalt material. Use the quantities as recommended by
 the contractor and accepted by the engineer. Establish the actual rates during
 the first asphalt and aggregate application.
 Before the asphalt surface treatment operation begins, calibrate and set
 the flow rates of the distributor and spray bar along with the aggregate
 spreader at a remote location offsite in a manner acceptable to the engineer.
 Aggregate spread rates may be adjusted by the engineer. It should be noted
 that after the aggregate spreader passes, the aggregate should never cover
 100 percent of the roadway surface. The asphalt coated surface should be
 visible between the aggregates. Strike off aggregate trucks at the loading
 area for proper material yield measurements.
 The aggregate spreader shall follow immediately behind the asphalt
 distributor. Make the initial pass with the rollers immediately following the
 aggregate spreader before the emulsion breaks.
 507.06.1 Asphalt Material: In general, the rate of asphalt is increased
 if the road is absorbent, badly cracked, or coarse, and is decreased if the road
 is smooth and flushed with asphalt. Guidelines for adjusting the rate of
 asphalt emulsion in gallons per square yards are shown in Table 507-3.
 Do not allow the length of spread of asphalt material to exceed that which
 can be covered by aggregate within approximately one minute.
 Apply asphalt material at a uniform rate for the full width of treatment
 unless otherwise directed by the engineer. Keep the application of asphalt
 material consistently within ±0.02 gallons per square yard, otherwise stop
 construction and recalibrate the distributor to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 
 292
 
 Adjust the height of the spray bar and the angle of the nozzles so that
 individual spray fans do not interfere with each other and uniform double or
 triple coverage is achieved. Maintain a minimum of 100 gallons of asphalt
 material in the distributor during operation.
 Adjust and maintain one of the special spray nozzles at the ends of the
 spray bar to provide a sharp edge for the asphalt material on the edge of the
 roadway surface being covered. When the application is less in width than
 the length of the spray bar, move these special nozzles to provide the
 specified edge lines.
 When any nozzle becomes blocked during application of asphalt material,
 immediately stop the flow of material and clean the nozzles. When the
 engineer directs that application be made over less than the full width of the
 roadway at a time, slightly overlap adjacent treatments longitudinally.
 Operate the distributor along a marked edge to keep the surface treatment in
 proper alignment.
 To secure uniform distribution at the transverse junction of two
 treatments, stop the distributor promptly before the flow decreases. Place
 building paper or other suitable material over the end of the previous
 application.
 Start the joining application on the building paper.
 Satisfactorily remove and dispose building paper in accordance with Section
 202 or as directed. Do not burn building papers.
 During application of asphalt material, do not splatter adjacent
 pavements, structures, and trees with asphalt material. Do not clean or
 discharge the distributor into ditches, borrow pits, on shoulders or along the
 right-of-way.
 Remove excess asphalt material at the junction between distributor loads
 or correct satisfactorily. Areas of the surface to be treated, which are not
 covered with asphalt material directly from the distributor shall be covered
 by means of a hand-held spray attachment equipped with nozzles.
 507.06.2 Aggregates:
 Begin aggregate spreading operations
 immediately after the application of the asphalt materials. Place all
 aggregates for hot applications in a surface dry condition. Apply aggregate
 material within approximately one minute after application of the asphalt
 material.
 Uniformly spread aggregate over the full width of asphalt material with
 one pass of the spreading equipment and with the application being sharply
 defined at edges. Do not drive equipment on uncovered asphalt material.
 When necessary to obtain uniform coverage, hand broom the surface.
 
 293
 
 Hand spreading will be permitted in conjunction with self-propelled
 spreaders over areas inaccessible to spreaders. Cover asphalt material with
 the appropriate rate of aggregate before rolling.
 507.06.3 Multiple Applications: When multiple applications are
 to be placed, allow a minimum of 48 hours to elapse between each successive
 application of emulsions. Successive hot applications can be placed without
 delay.
 507.06.4 Interlayers: An interlayer shall be Type E as specified
 herein and may be placed on raw or stabilized base, on a milled surface,
 between lifts of asphalt, or over existing portland cement concrete pavement
 which will be overlaid with asphalt. Use a liquid application rate that
 corresponds to the proper aggregate size given in Table 507-1 or 507-2 as
 adjusted by the engineer to meet existing conditions. Do not place asphalt
 concrete on an emulsion surface treatment for a minimum of five days after
 application. Hot applied interlayers may be overlaid immediately.
 507.07 ROLLING AND BROOMING AGGREGATE MATERIAL.
 Roll the surface immediately after spreading the aggregate material using a
 minimum of three pneumatic tire rollers. Make the first pass within
 approximately one minute of spreading the aggregate. Proceed rolling in a
 longitudinal direction, beginning at the outer edges of the application.
 Make a minimum of three (3) passes over a single point. Complete all
 rolling within 1/2 hour after aggregate material has been spread. Immediately
 correct any deficiencies or damage in the aggregate material detected during
 rolling and reroll as directed. Continue rolling aggregate material until
 uniform coverage has been obtained. Roll the remaining applications as
 specified for the first application. Do not use a steel wheel roller.
 Lightly broom or blow the surface to remove loose material. Completely
 remove all loose material from all roadway surfaces, including paved
 shoulders. If the engineer determines the amount of loose material is
 excessive, pick it up and remove from the project instead of brooming onto
 the adjacent slopes.
 507.08 PROTECTION. Traffic shall not be allowed on the surface until
 the aggregate has been placed, rolled, and, if necessary, lightly broomed or
 blown. For cold applications, lightly broom or blow each treatment
 beginning the next morning, and continue removing loose aggregate up to
 final acceptance of the project, if necessary.
 Distribute aggregate material over the surface to absorb any free asphalt,
 covering any area deficient with aggregate material, and roll as directed at
 294
 
 no direct pay. Do not displace embedded material during maintenance.
 When placing lightweight aggregate and a dusting problem occurs, use a
 vacuum sweeper without the sweeper engaged to remove loose aggregate.
 Loose aggregate material will not be permitted on the surface and shall be
 promptly removed.
 507.09 MEASUREMENT. The quantities of asphalt material and
 aggregate incorporated into the completed and accepted asphalt surface
 treatment will be measured separately. Design quantities are based on
 horizontal dimensions. Design quantities will be adjusted when the engineer
 makes changes to adjust to field conditions. Each size aggregate will be
 measured by the square yard per application. Asphalt material will be
 measured in the distributor by the gallon at application temperatures.
 507.10 PAYMENT. Payment for placement and maintenance of asphalt
 materials and aggregates will be made at the contract unit prices, subject to
 the payment adjustment provisions of Section 1002 for specification
 deviations of asphalt materials. The Materials and Testing Section will
 provide the payment adjustment percentage for asphalt materials. Payment
 for removal of pavement markings will be included in this pay item.

 established.
 509.02 EQUIPMENT. Use an approved self-propelled milling machine or
 grinder for milling asphalt surfacing in accordance with 503.12.
 509.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Pavement surfaces
 resulting from milling operations shall be of uniform texture, grade and cross
 slope and free from loose material. Re-mill surfaces not meeting these
 requirements at no direct pay. Uneven, undulating surfaces will not be
 accepted. If ridges are excessive, the engineer may require additional milling,
 replacement of milling machine teeth, or other corrective action. Limit the
 maximum depth of milling to 2 inches per day when traffic is being
 maintained. Maintain a maximum 2-inch depth at milling edge of
 embankment at all times.
 Use a minimum length 25-foot traveling reference plane on the first pass
 of the milling machine. A shoe device may be used on adjacent passes.
 When the entire roadway width has not been planed to a flush surface by
 the end of a work period, resulting in a vertical or near vertical longitudinal
 face exceeding 2 inches in height, slope this longitudinal face as directed.
 Place smooth transitions at transverse joints prior to restoring to traffic by
 milling or by using an asphalt concrete mix. Do not use RAP. Transitions
 shall be a minimum length of one linear foot per 1/4 inch of the milled depth.
 Make provisions at drives and turnouts to maintain local traffic.
 Remove asphalt concrete next to structures or in small irregular areas that
 cannot be removed by the milling machine by other acceptable methods.
 Provide drainage of milled areas where needed by cutting through the
 shoulder to the ditch on the same day that adjacent milling is performed.
 The milling operation shall not precede the subsequent paving operation
 or a shoulder stabilization operation by more than 15 calendar days. If
 shoulder stabilization has been performed, the paving operation shall
 commence 7 calendar days after the completion of the shoulder stabilization
 operation. Delay in starting the paving operations that causes a further
 
 300
 
 degradation in the milled surface shall be corrected by the contractor by
 additional milling or providing leveling at no additional pay.
 Severe raveling or degradation of the milled surface that occurs shall be
 reported to the engineer in writing with station locations identified. The
 engineer will direct corrective action.
 Place temporary pavement markings prior to opening the roadway to
 traffic in accordance with Section 713.
 Haul all reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material to be retained by the
 Department for its recycling program, or by other government entities to the
 storage facility indicated on the plans and stockpile as directed. The
 contractor may also be required to retain a specified percentage or quantity of
 the RAP generated by the project.
 Make required joint repairs prior to milling. Complete pavement patching
 before milling, unless additional areas requiring patching are exposed by the
 milling. Perform pavement patching and joint repair in accordance with
 Section 510. The initial face of a butt joint can match the radius of the cold
 planing milling drum. No true vertical face is required.
 509.04 MEASUREMENT. The Department will measure milling by the
 square yard of asphalt concrete surfacing satisfactorily removed. No
 additional measurement will be made for multiple passes required to achieve
 total milling depth shown on the plans. Measurement of contractor retained
 RAP will be by the cubic yard, theoretical in-place plan quantity, and will be
 credited to the Department by treating it as a negative quantity in the Schedule
 of Pay Items.
 509.05 PAYMENT. Payment for milling of asphalt pavement will be made

 pavement widening material, or fill and compact open areas or trenches at
 the end of each day's operations. Under-thickness in excess of 1/2 inch will
 be corrected at no direct pay.
 Excavate and dispose of the excess material beyond the right-of-way in
 accordance with Section 202 at no direct pay. Uniformly compact the
 subgrade.
 For joint repair, clean contact surfaces of existing pavement and apply a
 thin, uniform layer of approved asphalt tack coat prior to placing asphalt
 mixture in the joint.
 Patch and widen with asphalt concrete conforming to Section 502 except
 that priming of the subgrade will not be required. Clean contact surfaces of
 303
 
 pavement and apply a uniform layer of approved asphalt tack coat before
 placement of asphalt concrete. Do not overlay patches for a minimum of 5
 calendar days. Spread, finish, and compact the asphalt concrete leaving the
 surface smooth and slightly above the edge of existing pavement. To provide
 lateral support, the contractor may construct temporary berms of excavated
 material against the outside edge of widening strips prior to rolling. If outside
 edges of widening strips are not edged up by the end of the work day, place
 super cones or drums on a maximum of 100-feet centers at no direct pay.
 510.05 MEASUREMENT.
 510.05.1 Patching: The Department will measure patching of
 pavement by the square yard or ton of existing pavement designated to be
 removed and replaced. Saw-cutting, removal of existing surfacing, base
 course, required excavation, and application of tack coat will not be
 measured for payment.
 510.05.2 Widening: The quantities of widening for payment will be
 the design areas in square yards or ton as shown on the plans and adjustments
 thereto. Adjust design quantities if the engineer makes changes to adjust to
 field conditions. Design quantities are based on the horizontal dimensions
 shown on the plans. No measurement for payment will be made for
 widening placed outside the dimensions shown on the plans or established
 by the engineer. Required excavation, removal of existing pavement and
 base course, asphalt tack coat and disposal of removed material will not be
 measured for payment. Measure the thickness and width in accordance with
 DOTD TR 602.
 510.05.3 Joint Repair: The Department will measure joint repair by
 the ton of asphalt concrete used to fill the joint. Measurement will be made
 in accordance with 502.14.
 510.06 PAYMENT.
 510.06.1 Patching: Payment for pavement patching will be made at
 the contract unit prices per square yard or ton, subject to the following
 provisions:
 Payment adjustments for deficiencies in asphalt concrete and asphalt
 materials will be applied at 1/2 the contract unit price for pavement patching.
 Asphalt concrete will be subject to the payment adjustment provisions of
 Section 502, Table 502-7 with 4-inch cores allowed.
 When the engineer orders additional thickness of patching in excess of
 plan thickness, payment for the additional thickness will be made as follows.
 When patching is on a square yard basis, the value per inch thickness will be
 304
 
 calculated by dividing the contract unit price per square yard by the plan
 thickness. Thickness of patches will be measured from the surface that exists
 at the time of patching. Payment for the additional thickness will be made
 at 50 percent of the value per inch thus determined.
 When the engineer approves of an under-thickness of patching less than
 plan thickness, a deduction in payment will be made. The value per inch
 will be calculated by dividing the contract unit price per square yard by the
 plan thickness. This deduction per inch of under-thickness will be made at
 50 percent of the value per inch.
 When payment for patching is made per ton, no adjustment in unit price
 will be made for additional thickness or under-thickness. Any patching that
 develops or is required between the time of initial patching operations and
 the placement of the first lift of asphalt concrete will be paid for at the
 contract unit price. Any patching required due to base failure after placement
 of the first lift of asphalt concrete will be paid for at twice the contract unit
 price.
 510.06.2 Widening: Payment for pavement widening will be made at
 the contract unit price per square yard or ton. Over-widths will be accepted
 at no additional pay. Correct under-widths by furnishing and placing
 additional asphalt concrete to a minimum width of 1 foot and plan thickness
 at no direct pay. Payment adjustments for deficiencies in asphalt concrete
 and asphalt materials will be applied at 1/2 the contract unit price for
 pavement widening. Asphalt concrete will be subject to the payment
 adjustment provisions of Section 502.
 510.06.3 Joint Repair: Payment for pavement joint repair will be
 made at the contract unit price per ton.
 Payment will be made under:

 601.03.1.6 Finishing Equipment: Use slip-form paving equipment or
 equipment with stationary side forms to construct pavement.
 601.03.1.6.1 Slip-Form Method: Place concrete with a slip-form
 paver that can spread, consolidate, screed, and finish the freshly placed concrete in
 one complete pass. Vibrators for slip form pavers shall be internal type with either
 immersed tube or multiple spuds and capable of consolidating the concrete for the
 full width and depth. Ensure that vibrators attached to the spreader or finishing
 machine, or mounted on a separate carriage, do not touch joints, load transfer
 devices, the subgrade, or side forms. Vibrate only when paver is in motion. Limit
 the vibration frequency from 5,000 to 8,000 vibrations per minute.
 601.03.1.6.2 Stationary Side-Form Method: Use a type of screed
 sufficiently rigid to retain its shape to finish the surface to the specified typical
 section. Use wooden or metal screeds for hand finishing or mechanical twin
 oscillating-type roller or truss-type screeds that are at least two feet longer than the
 slab width. The contractor may use hand held vibrators for side form concrete
 placements. Maintain a minimum frequency of 4,500 vibrations per minute for the
 approved hand-held vibrators.
 601.03.1.7 Concrete Saw: Provide saws to timely cut joints and backup
 saws in case of equipment failure.
 601.03.1.8 Forms: Provide metal, solid, and stable forms having a depth
 of the specified pavement thickness with a minimum base width of 0.8 of the depth
 except as otherwise approved. Use flexible or curved forms for curves up to 100foot radius. Keep forms rigid and stable during paving. Remove forms with battered
 top surfaces or forms that are bent or broken.
 Limit the maximum variance in the top of the form to 1/8 inch in 10 feet from a
 true plane. Limit the maximum face variance to 3/8 inch in 10 feet. Tightly lock
 forms together at the ends of abutting form sections and are set securely on the grade.
 601.03.1.8.1 Built-Up Forms: When approved, built-up forms may be
 used; however, do not exceed 2 inches of build-up. There is no limitation on the use
 of built-up forms or amount of build-up where the total area of pavement is less than
 2,000 square yards.
 
 309
 
 601.03.1.9 Floats: Machine floats shall be composed of cutting and
 smoothing floats suspended from, and guided by, a rigid frame constantly in contact
 with side forms. Long handled floats shall have blades at least 5 feet long and
 6 inches wide.
 601.03.1.10 Straightedge:
 Use a minimum 10-foot metal static
 straightedge with handles approximately 3 feet longer than the paving width.
 601.03.1.11 Artificial Turf Drag: The artificial turf shall be made of
 molded polyethylene with synthetic turf blades approximately 0.85 inch long
 containing approximately 7,200 individual blades per square foot. The artificial turf
 carpet shall be full pavement width and of sufficient size that during the finishing
 operation it produces 1/16 inch deep striations in the pavement surface. For
 pavement 16 feet or more in width, mount the artificial turf on a bridge that travels
 on the forms that allows control of the time and rate of texturing. If necessary, weigh
 the carpet to maintain intimate contact with the pavement surface.
 601.03.1.12 Burlap Drag: The burlap drag shall consist of a seamless
 strip of damp burlap that shall produce uniform 1/16 inch deep striations in the
 pavement surface after dragging it longitudinally along the full width of the
 pavement. For pavement widths 16 feet or more, mount the drag on a bridge that
 travels on the forms that allows control of the time and rate of texturing.
 601.03.1.13 Tine Texturing Device: The tine-texturing device shall
 have metal tines that produce randomly spaced grooves uniform in appearance and
 transverse to roadway. Tine dimensions and spacing requirements shall be in
 accordance with 601.03.9.8. The pavement shall have a continuously tine textured
 surface.
 601.03.2 Mixing Limitations: Ensure adequate natural or artificial light
 when mixing, placing, or finishing concrete. See 105.20.
 Abide by specified temperature limitations for mixing, placing, finishing, and
 curing. See 901.11.1 and 901.11.2.
 601.03.3 Conditioning Subgrade or Base Course: Correct deficient
 areas in subgrade or base courses. Clean the subgrade or base course of loose
 material and maintain the finished subgrade in a smooth, compact, satisfactory
 condition. Restore disturbed areas prior to placing the pavement in accordance
 with 301.14. Correct all deficient areas at no direct pay.
 Keep the subgrade and base course uniformly moist when placing concrete,
 unless specifications require a waterproof cover material.
 601.03.3.1 Asphalt Concrete Base Course for PCCP: Wet the
 asphalt surface to minimize early-age cracking. At the time of concrete placement,
 ensure the surface is moist with no standing water.
 Alternatively, apply a mixture to the asphalt concrete base course to prevent heat
 buildup in the base and bonding between the concrete pavement and base. If the
 310
 
 contractor elects to use a whitewash mixture, use mixtures consisting of hydrated
 lime and water or a wax-based white-pigmented curing compound. The whitewash
 mixture used and application rate shall be the responsibility of the contractor. The
 mixture proposed by the contractor will be subject to Department approval.
 601.03.4 Preparing the Proper Grade: Trim, fill, and thoroughly compact
 all irregularities below the established grade with subgrade or base course material
 for a minimum width of 16 inches on both sides of the base of the form. Tamp or
 trim above-grade defects or variations to plan elevation. Maintain the finished grade
 in a smooth and compacted condition until placement of pavement. The Department
 must approve the subgrade or base course before placement of concrete.
 601.03.5 Setting Forms: Ensure that the foundation under forms is firm,
 provides stable continuous contact, and is true to line and grade. The Project
 Engineer may allow shims up to 1/2 inch, not to exceed 20 percent per individual
 form section.
 Form sections shall be tightly locked and free from movement in any direction.
 No settlement or springing of forms under the paving equipment is acceptable. At a
 minimum, place a pin at each side of every form joint. Pins shall be of sufficient
 length to provide adequate anchorage. Limit the maximum variance of the top form
 to 1/8 inch in 10 feet from a true plane. Limit the maximum face variance to 3/8 inch
 in 10 feet.
 601.03.6 Placing and Consolidating Concrete: Deposit concrete on a
 surface-moist base or subgrade with a minimum of handling. Base course must be
 less than 120°F immediately prior to concrete placement. Place concrete
 continuously between transverse joints. Use appropriate tools for necessary hand
 spreading. Place concrete as close to joints as possible without disturbing them.
 Ensure workers wear footwear clean of foreign matter.
 Except for concrete sawing equipment, restrict operation of mechanical
 equipment on the pavement until obtaining a minimum compressive strength of
 3,000 psi in accordance with DOTD TR-230.
 Pave adjacent lanes only after a minimum elapse of 1-day with no observable
 marring of the surface.
 Rain protection along with hot and cold weather limitations of 901.11 shall apply.
 Complete the surface finish as specified in 601.03.9.7. Texture the surface as
 specified in 601.03.9.8.
 Cure the surface and edges as specified in 601.03.10.
 601.03.6.1 Slip-Form Method: At the option of the contractor, the slipform paving method may be used.
 Place concrete with an acceptable slip-form paver designed to spread,
 consolidate, screed and float finish freshly placed concrete in one pass of the
 machine with only a minimum amount of hand finishing necessary to provide a
 311
 
 dense, homogeneous pavement in conformance with plans and specifications. Equip
 the machine with vibrators conforming to 601.03.1.6.1. Vibrate concrete for the full
 pavement width and depth for complete consolidation. Hold sliding forms rigidly
 together laterally to prevent spreading of forms.
 Provide concrete of a uniform consistency exhibiting minimal bleed water and
 laitance. Operate the slip-form paver with as nearly a continuous uniform forward
 movement as possible. Coordinate mixing, delivering and placing of concrete to
 provide uniform progress. Concrete plants shall have sufficient mixing capacity to
 provide such continuous delivery of concrete to enable the paver to advance at a
 minimum rate of 1.5 feet per minute. If it is necessary to stop forward movement of
 the paver, also immediately stop the vibrator and tamping elements. If forward
 movement of the paver is delayed for a period, the engineer may direct fogging of
 fresh concrete. See 601.03.8 for construction joint requirements. Apply no outside
 tractive force to the machine except as controlled from the machine.
 601.03.6.2 Stationary Side-Form Method: Deposit concrete as near as
 possible to forms and joints assemblies without disturbing the form or joint
 assembly.
 Use vibrators to consolidate concrete against and along the faces of all forms and
 the length and both sides of all joint assemblies. Limit vibrator operation to
 5 seconds in any one location.
 601.03.7 Test Specimens: According to DOTD sampling and testing
 procedures, furnish concrete for casting test specimens and all required tests at no
 direct pay.
 601.03.8 Joints, Seals, and Sealants: Saw and seal the joints according
 to Standard Plans CP-01.
 Before preparation and sealing, verify each joint for proper width, depth,
 alignment.
 Prior to sealing, the pavement may be opened to traffic. When poured or extruded
 sealants are used, allow the concrete to cure at least 7 days prior to sealing joints.
 Thoroughly clean all joints immediately prior to sealing. Use sandblasting
 followed by an oil-free air jet to clean the faces and joint openings before sealing.
 Use poured or extruded sealants for sealing.
 Cured sealant is required before allowing traffic on pavement. When using a
 poured or extruded sealant in accordance with 1005.02, close the pavement to traffic
 for at least one day after sealing. When elastomeric compression seals are used,
 allow traffic immediately following completion of sealing.
 Repair any cracking, chipping, spalling, or tearing of the concrete joints at no
 direct pay by approved methods to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 Before sealing, joints shall be free of spalls, fractures, breaks, or voids. For areas
 requiring minor repairs, chip back to sound concrete and repair with an approved
 312
 
 non-shrinking patching system in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations, when approved by the engineer.
 601.03.8.1 Poured Sealants and Preformed Joint Sealers: The
 following additional requirements apply to the installation of poured sealants and
 preformed joint sealants complying with 1005.02, 1005.03, and 1005.06.

 sandblasting to remove concrete curing membrane, laitance and other foreign matter
 from the joint. Upon completion of sandblasting, clean and dry the joint and adjacent
 areas of all foreign matter.
 601.03.8.2.2 Application: Install poured sealants complying with
 1005.02.1 in accordance with the following requirements.
 Do not install the sealant until joint verification for cleanliness, dimensions, and
 alignment. Seal the joint without formation of entrapped air or voids. Air
 temperature at the time of installation shall be at least 50°F and rising.
 Furnish a mobile, heated, double-walled agitator type kettle with suitable oil
 medium in the outer space for heat transfer capable of maintaining a sealant
 temperature of 380°F to 410°F. Provide easy access to kettles to facilitate cleaning.
 Thoroughly clean kettles of foreign substances or previously used compounds and
 flush daily with flushing oil. Provide this equipment with an automatic continuous
 temperature-recording chart for constant kettle temperature surveillance. Provide a
 direct connecting pressure type-extruding device with nozzles shaped for insertion
 into the joint. Application equipment shall recirculate sealant material in the inner
 kettle when not in use and shall be capable of filling the joint with sealant material
 free of voids or entrapped air. The applicator shall be subject to approval.
 601.03.8.3 Preformed Elastomeric Compression Seals: Preformed
 elastomeric compression seals shall comply with 1005.03. When using a pumped
 adhesive-lubricant material, allow a maximum of 30 percent dilution with a material
 recommended by the manufacturer. Apply the adhesive lubricant just prior to
 installation of the seal and completely cover the seal’s sidewalls.
 Install seals by machine on projects requiring 3,000 feet or more of joint sealing.
 Do not stretch the compression seal more than 5 percent. Prior to beginning
 installation, cut and install, a length of seal equal to the pavement width so that
 stretching may be measured. Make random checks for stretching as deemed
 necessary by the engineer. If the adhesive lubricant has chemically set and exceeded
 maximum stretch limits, remove and clean the seal, re-clean the joint, and re-install
 the seal. There shall be no field splicing.
 601.03.8.4 Silicone Sealant: The silicone sealant shall comply with
 1005.02.3 or 1005.02.4. Keep the sandblasted joint faces dry and dust free prior to
 sealant installation. The air temperature at the time of placement shall be at least
 313
 
 50°F and rising. Place backer material complying with 1005.02 as shown in the
 plans. Prime the joint faces in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations
 when a silicone sealant conforming to 1005.02.4 is used.
 Force non-sag material against the joint walls by approved tooling methods that
 will ensure proper adhesion. No tooling is required when a self-leveling material is
 used.
 601.03.8.5 Preformed Polyurethane Foam: Preformed polyurethane
 foam shall comply with 1005.06. Install preformed polyurethane foam using an
 approved, moisture insensitive lubricant-adhesive according to the manufacturer’s
 instructions.
 601.03.8.6 Tie Bars: For size, length, and spacing of tie bars see Standard
 Plans CP-01.
 Place tie bars using mechanical equipment or secure them with chairs to prevent
 movement during concrete placement. Place tie bars perpendicular to the face of the
 joint, centered in the slab depth, and parallel to the finished surface. Do not place
 tie bars within 18 inches of contraction or expansion joints.
 Do not coat tie bars with asphalt or other material or enclose in tubes or sleeves.
 Bend only Grade 40 tie bars at right angles against the form of the first lane
 constructed and straighten into final position before placement of concrete in
 adjacent lane. Alternatively, to bending tie bars, use approved mechanical butt
 splicing devices complying with 806.06.
 Replace tie bars that break or show evidence of fracture upon straightening. Drill
 holes for tie bars approximately 1/8 inch larger than the diameter of the bar. Holes
 shall be clean and moisture free. Use an Approved Materials List adhesive anchor
 system in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 601.03.8.7 Dowel Bars: Dowel bars shall have a uniformly round cross
 section and shall be saw-cut, smooth, and free of burrs, projections, and
 deformations. Dowel bars shall be plastic coated in accordance with 1009.03.
 Place dowel bars in approved basket assemblies or by an approved mechanical
 device that is capable of accurately placing the dowels to the proper depth and
 alignment. Position dowel bars parallel to the pavement centerline, and parallel to
 the surface without any skew of individual bars.
 Carefully and thoroughly consolidate the concrete around the dowel bars. When
 using a mechanical insertion device for placement, firmly hold dowel bars in
 position during the consolidation process so that the bars do not move when released
 in the concrete by the mechanical insertion device.
 Accurately and securely, mark the transverse centerline of the in-place dowel bars
 prior to sawing the transverse contraction joint over the dowels.
 
 314
 
 Provide an approved expansion tube on each bar used in expansion joints. The
 tube shall fit the dowel bar tightly and the closed end shall be watertight. Locate
 dowel bar placement as shown on the plans.
 With the approval of the engineer, repair all slightly damaged coatings of dowel
 bars by lightly oiling or greasing; otherwise replace.
 601.03.8.8 Types of Joints:
 601.03.8.8.1 Longitudinal Joint (Type LJ): Construct a
 longitudinal joint between the slabs when placing shoulder and roadway pavement
 slabs separately. Construct a longitudinal joint in roadway pavements placed
 monolithically and exceeding 15 feet in total width as shown on plans. Construct a
 longitudinal joint at the centerline of ramps exceeding 15 feet in width. Construct
 longitudinal joints with tie bars when constructing adjacent lanes separately. Ensure
 proper consolidation of concrete adjacent to longitudinal joints. Repair or replace
 any cracking, chipping, spalling, or tearing of the concrete at no direct pay by
 approved methods to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 Form the longitudinal joint (Type LJ) in fresh concrete. Alternatively, saw
 hardened concrete as soon as the concrete has reached sufficient strength to support
 the sawing machine, and tearing and raveling of the concrete joint does not occur.
 Complete the sawing operation in a timely manner such that random cracking does
 not occur.
 The joint width shall be 5/32 to 1/4 inches; joint depth shall be as specified on
 the plans. The joint sealant shall conform to 1005.02.1 or 1005.02.3.
 Immediately prior to sealing, clean the saw cut and adjacent concrete surfaces.
 Do not permit any equipment, other than the sawing machine, on the pavement
 during sawing operations. Provide sufficient back-up equipment at the jobsite to
 continue timely sawing operations in case of a breakdown.
 During paving operations, clearly and accurately mark joint locations. When
 sawing operations are not providing proper crack control at the joint, modify sawing
 operations as necessary to provide proper crack control.
 601.03.8.8.2 Transverse Expansion Joint (Type EJ-1 1/2 Inch):
 When a slip form paving method is used, construct the transverse expansion joint
 with a 1 1/2 inch wide sawed joint over a sleeper slab. Construct the sleeper slab
 from Class A1 Concrete or one of the pavement type mixes complying with Section
 901. Place one layer of tarpaper equivalent to a minimum of 30 pounds per 100
 square feet between the sleeper slab and the pavement. If the EJ modified joint is
 used, construct all the expansion joints using this method unless otherwise approved
 by the engineer.
 601.03.8.8.3 Transverse Expansion Joint (Type EJ-4 Inch): This
 joint consists of a 4-inch wide joint sawed over a sleeper slab. Construct the sleeper
 slab from Class A1 concrete, or one of the pavement type mixes conforming to
 315
 
 Section 901. Place one layer of tarpaper, weighing 30 pounds per 100 square feet,
 between the sleeper slab and the pavement. Joint material shall comply with
 1005.06.
 601.03.8.8.4 Transverse Expansion Joints (Type EJAlternative): Replace concrete disturbed during expansion joint installation with
 fresh concrete and vibrate with a surface vibrator. Use a preformed elastomeric
 compression seal complying with 1005.03 or a silicone complying with 1005.02.
 601.03.8.8.5 Wood Filler: Use wood filler conforming to 1005.01.2.
 Do not use a board less than six feet long. Do not use damaged wood fillers. Do
 not field modify wood filler.
 Use dowel bars to provide adequate bracing to hold the wood filler in a vertical
 position. Do not permit finished joints to deviate more than 1/4 inch in horizontal
 alignment from a straight line. For joint fillers assembled in sections, do not allow
 offsets between adjacent units. Do not permit plugs of concrete within the expansion
 space. Seal the joint as specified.
 601.03.8.8.6 Transverse Contraction Joints (Type TCJ):
 Transverse contraction joints shall consist of planes of weakness created in the cross
 section of the pavement. Install load transfer devices at these joints. Construct joints
 for pavement with a design speed equal to or greater than 45 mph) by sawing as
 specified in method 1 below. Construct by any of the following methods for joints
 for pavement with a design speed of less than 45 mph. For small and irregular areas,
 the engineer may allow methods 2 or 3.
 Method 1: Construct joints by sawing after the concrete has reached sufficient
 strength to support sawing equipment. During paving operations, clearly and
 accurately mark joint locations. Saw joints to required joint width and depth in one
 pass. Saw to a width 5/32 to 1/4 inches and to the required joint depth. If forms
 prohibit sawing the transverse contraction joint for the full width of pavement, place
 a full-joint depth insert in the 6 inches adjacent to the forms. Conduct the sawing as
 soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to avoid tearing of the concrete and
 complete sawing in a timely manner to avoid random cracking.
 Immediately prior to sealing joint, clean the saw cut as required.
 Do not permit any equipment other than the sawing machine on the pavement
 during sawing operations. Provide sufficient back up equipment at the jobsite to
 continue timely sawing operations.
 If sawing operations are not providing proper crack control, modify sawing
 operations, equipment, timing, and/or concrete mix as necessary to provide proper
 crack control.
 Repair any cracking, chipping, spalling, or tearing of the concrete joints at no
 direct pay by approved methods to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 316
 
 Method 2: Install an approved removable joint former to create a joint to the
 required width and depth. Establish a vertical plane prior to installing the removable
 joint former in the fresh concrete with a T-iron. The blade of the T-iron shall have
 a thickness of 1/4 to 3/8 inch and a depth 1/4 inch greater than the depth of the insert.
 Insert the joint former in place and consolidate using a vibrating bullfloat. While
 concrete is workable but stiff enough to maintain joint opening, raise joint former
 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch with all laitance removed alongside of insert. The joint former
 shall remain in place at least 12 hours. If undamaged in removal and clean of foreign
 material, these joint formers are reusable. Immediately prior to sealing joint, clean
 the joint as required.
 Method 3: Install a combination joint former/sealer device as specified in 1005.04
 to form a joint in fresh concrete. Establish a vertical plane prior to installing the seal
 insert device in the fresh concrete with a T-iron. The blade of the T-iron shall have
 a thickness of 1/4 to 3/8 inch and a depth 1/4 inch greater than the depth of the insert.
 Insert the joint former/sealer in place and consolidate using a vibrating bullfloat.
 The top cap of the insert shall be flush with the top surface of the pavement at the
 completion of all finishing operations.
 601.03.8.8.7 Transverse Construction Joints (Type CJ):
 Construct transverse construction joints when there is an interruption of more than
 1/2 hour in concreting operations. Do not construct a transverse construction joint
 within 5 feet of an expansion or contraction joint. If sufficient concrete is not
 available at the time of interruption to form a slab at least 5 feet long, remove
 concrete back to the preceding working joint (which must be maintained) or 5 feet
 behind the working joint to establish a non-working joint. Use hand vibrators to
 ensure proper consolidation of concrete adjacent to transverse construction joints.
 Transverse construction joints shall include deformed bars conforming to the size,
 spacing, and dimensions of the dowel bars to form a non-working joint.
 601.03.8.8.8 Longitudinal Butt Joint (Type LBJ): Construct
 longitudinal butt joints when adding lanes of pavement. Place deformed tie bars of
 the specified length, size, spacing, and material perpendicular to longitudinal butt
 joints. Do not coat tie bars with asphalt or other material or enclose in tubes or
 sleeves.
 Install tie bars in clean, moisture-free holes, drilled into the existing pavement
 approximately 1/8 inch larger than the diameter of the tie bar. Use an Approved
 Materials List adhesive anchor system, or an Approved Materials List Type I,
 Grade C epoxy resin system.
 Mix the epoxy in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, with no
 fillers or extenders added. Using a caulking gun or other approved method, inject
 sufficient epoxy to fill the void between the tie-bar and hole. Rotate the bar while
 inserting to ensure complete coverage with no voids as verified by epoxy squeezing
 317
 
 out when the bar is inserted. Prevent bars from being disturbed until epoxy has
 sufficiently cured. Place epoxy using manufacturer’s temperature limitations but do
 not apply epoxy when ambient temperature is below 40°F.
 601.03.8.8.9 Transverse Butt Joint (Type BJ): Construct
 transverse butt joints when extending existing pavement. Place smooth dowel bars
 of the specified length, size, coating, spacing, and material perpendicular to
 transverse butt joints.
 Install dowel bars in clean, moisture-free holes, drilled into the existing pavement
 approximately 1/8 inch larger than the diameter of the dowel bar. Use an Approved
 Materials List adhesive anchor system, or an Approved Materials List Type I,
 Grade C epoxy resin system.
 Mix the epoxy in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, with no
 fillers or extenders added. Using a caulking gun or other approved method, inject
 sufficient epoxy to fill the void between the dowel bar and hole. Rotate the bar while
 inserting to ensure complete coverage with no voids as verified by epoxy squeezing
 out when the bar is inserted. Prevent bars from being disturbed until epoxy has
 sufficiently cured. Place epoxy using manufacturer’s temperature limitations but do
 not apply epoxy when ambient temperature is below 40°F.
 Establish joint sealant reservoir in accordance with plan details (See CP-01).
 601.03.9 Concrete Paving: The normal sequence for paving is strike-off,
 consolidation, screeding, floating (use hand floats only if necessary), remove
 laitance, straight edging, final surface finish, and curing. Use a mechanically
 powered finishing machine capable of spreading, consolidating, screeding and
 finishing the concrete to the required pavement elevation and cross section.
 Mechanical roller or truss-type screeds are allowed, if approved by the engineer, for
 projects with: concrete pavement lane lengths of 1,500 feet or less, continuous
 paving lengths less than 600 feet, pavement gaps, intersections, or when side
 clearance is restricted.
 Use work bridges or other devices to reach the pavement surface to finish,
 straightedge, and make corrections.
 If permitted by the engineer, apply water to the surface as a fog spray with
 approved equipment.
 601.03.9.1 Strike-Off: Strike off to achieve the specified cross section and
 pavement surface elevation.
 601.03.9.2 Consolidation: Consolidate concrete for full width and depth
 of the slab to eliminate voids without segregation. Consolidate under and around
 load transfer devices, and other features embedded within the pavement without
 causing damage or misalignment. Do not operate vibrators longer than 10 seconds
 in one location. Do not drag handheld vibrators through the concrete nor move the
 concrete using the vibrator.
 318
 
 601.03.9.3 Screeding: Screed the concrete to achieve the specified cross
 section and elevation.
 601.03.9.4 Floating: Float to achieve the specified grade and provide a
 tight-knit textured surface using an approved machine float.
 When necessary following machine floating, use long-handled floats to smooth
 and fill open-textured pavement areas. Hand finish with bull floats only where the
 surface left from the paving equipment contains voids or imperfections. In general,
 it is best to limit hand and mechanical finishing. Adjust the concrete mixture and/or
 the paving equipment if excessive floating is the only method to produce an
 acceptable tight-knit textured surface.
 Remove excess water or laitance from the pavement surface.
 601.03.9.5 Straight Edging: Test the fresh concrete surface for trueness
 with a straightedge to achieve surface tolerance. Immediately fill depressions with
 freshly mixed concrete, strike off, and refinish. Trim and refinish high areas. Ensure
 the surface across joints meets the requirements for smoothness. Continue
 straightedge testing and surface corrections until the entire surface is free from
 deviations and the slab conforms to required grade and cross section. Make
 adjustments if continuous hand corrections are required.
 601.03.9.6 Edging at Forms and Joints: Before tine texturing, work
 the edges on each side of the pavement and each side of the transverse expansion
 joints, Type EJ modified joints, and longitudinal construction joints, which are not
 sawed. Produce a well-defined, continuous radius and obtain a smooth, dense mortar
 finish with an approved tool. Round to the radius specified (1/4 inch approximate).
 Use a work bridge to work the joints. Do not disturb the pavement surface by tilting
 the tool during use.
 Eliminate tool marks on the slab adjacent to joints without disturbing the
 rounding of the slab. Remove concrete on top of joint filler.
 601.03.9.7 Final Surface Finish: Perform surface finishing with an
 artificial turf or burlap drag such that the resultant pavement surface is uniform in
 appearance and reasonably free from grooves over 1/16 inch deep. Provide an
 adjacent concrete shoulder with the same finish as the pavement. Keep the drag
 material free of hardened concrete. Replace drag materials that are dirty, exhibit
 wear, or produce unsatisfactory results.
 601.03.9.8 Transverse Tine Texturing: Operate the metal tinetexturing device by approved mechanical means when texturing roadway travel
 lanes. If approved, the contractor may use manual methods for tine texturing of
 ramps, crossovers, turnouts, split slab construction or other pavement sections. Tine
 texturing will not be required on parking areas, drives, or other areas as designated
 by the engineer. Rake tines shall be steel flat wire approximately 0.025 inches thick
 by 0.126 inches wide by 4 to 5 inches in length, randomly spaced, at a maximum
 319
 
 spacing of 1 1/2 inch and a minimum spacing of 3/8 inch with no more than
 50 percent of the spaces exceeding 1 inch . The width of tines shall be 1/8 ±
 1/64 inch. The depth of groove produced in the concrete shall be 3/16 inch
 maximum and 1/16 inch minimum, measured in accordance with DOTD TR 229.
 Provide the same finish on the adjacent concrete shoulders as the travel lane.
 Visually inspect the tine texture on the shoulders.
 Correct all pavements not meeting the above requirements by retining if concrete
 is still fresh or by mechanical grooving if the concrete has set. Restore the texture
 to specified depth, width, and spacing.
 601.03.10 Curing: Immediately after completing the surface finishing,
 uniformly spray all exposed pavement surfaces with white pigmented curing
 compound as soon as surface bleed water evaporates, or within one-half hour if
 evaporation occurs quickly. Apply curing compound to exposed edges without
 spraying any exposed tie bars. Do not apply curing compound during rainfall or to
 surfaces with standing water. Maintain curing continuously for 72 hours.
 Apply curing compound under pressure by mechanical sprayers at the rate
 recommended by the manufacturer, but in no case less than 1 gallon per 100 square
 feet of surface area. Use the fully atomizing type of spraying equipment with a tank
 agitator. Immediately prior to and during application thoroughly mix the compound,
 stirring continuously by mechanical methods.
 Hand spraying is allowed on small irregular widths or shapes and on surfaces
 exposed by form removal. Thoroughly agitate the curing compound prior to placing
 in the sprayer.
 After application of curing compound, resulting pavement surfaces shall have a
 uniform appearance of a “blank white sheet of paper.” Immediately reapply
 additional compound to all deficient areas during the curing period.
 601.03.11 Surface Tolerance (IRI):
 601.03.11.1 General: This subsection outlines the measurement of
 surface roughness, quality control requirements, corrective actions, and acceptance
 criteria for PCCP. Use the International Roughness Index (IRI) to determine the
 amount of roughness in a measured longitudinal profile. In the direction of travel,
 measure the longitudinal surface profile in inches per mile and report as the IRI; all
 in accordance with DOTD TR 644.
 601.03.11.2 Equipment: In accordance with TR 644, furnish a DOTD
 certified inertial profiler for quality control and acceptance testing. The inertial
 profiler shall measure both wheel paths simultaneously with laser height sensing
 equipment at a constant speed within the certified range. Due to the surface texture
 of PCCP, lasers with a footprint greater than a single point are recommended for
 accurate readings. Profilers require a current DOTD decal indicating the date of
 certification and the profiler’s system parameter settings.
 320
 
 Furnish a 10-foot metal static straightedge for quality control and acceptance
 testing for transverse cross slope, grade, and individual longitudinal bumps in excess
 of 1/4 inch in 10 feet. Additionally, bumps are not to exceed 1/4 inch in 10 feet for
 non-IRI pavements including but not limited to bike paths, detour roads, parking
 areas, sidewalks, turning lanes, turn outs, and shoulders.
 601.03.11.3 Quality Control;
 601.03.11.3.1 Longitudinal Smoothness: Run the certified profiler
 and evaluate the raw IRI data using the ProVAL “25-foot sliding baseline” to
 identify areas of localized roughness as defined by Table 601-2 for each wheelpath.
 Correct deficiencies in accordance with Table 601-2 and modify construction
 operations to mitigate deficiencies.
 Any individual bump, which is more than 1/4 inch when tested with a 10-foot
 metal static straightedge, is a deficiency, which requires correction.
 Have quality control IRI results available for assessment by the engineer as
 requested.
 
 601.03.11.3.2 Correction of Deficient Areas: Correct areas to meet
 the requirements of Table 601-2 and the 1/4 inch in 10 feet straight edge bump
 requirement. Correct transverse, cross slope, or grade deficiencies to meet
 specifications. Make corrections by removing and replacing the PCCP full depth,
 or by diamond grinding and reestablishing surface texture and depth. Make
 corrections at no direct pay.
 In cases involving minor dips and extreme vertical curves where grinding will
 not improve the surface profile, provide the engineer a justification plus a ProVAL
 screen shot for the area showing the 25-foot sliding baseline and corresponding 25foot profilograph along with a request to accept as constructed.
 Although omitted from corrective action, these areas still contribute to the overall
 IRI results.
 601.03.11.4 Acceptance:
 601.03.11.4.1 Longitudinal Surface Tolerance Acceptance:
 Measure the mainline continuously from start to finish in the direction of travel for
 each lane for the project’s entire length. Perform the measurement under the
 observation and in the presence of the certified DOTD inspector. For projects that
 qualify for 102 percent pay, in accordance with Table 601-1 and allowable grinding
 in accordance with Table 601-2, the Materials and Testing Section will verify the
 testing results. Measure the surface tolerance for acceptance at the completion of
 the project after all corrective actions.
 Profiler system parameter settings shall be verified before and during each run
 by the DOTD inspector. The inspector will witness and document the daily setup
 procedure and pre-operation tests performed by the contractor in accordance with
 the manufacturer’s procedures and DOTD TR 644. A copy of the manufacturer’s
 321
 
 setup, pre-operation, and general operating procedures for measuring surface
 tolerance, along with a copy of DOTD TR 644, shall be available at all times during
 measurement. Place a start and stop mark at the beginning and end of each travel
 lane so that the Department can rerun measurements.
 The mainline longitudinal surface tolerance IRI specification requirements are in
 Table 601-1.
 The Department will view the mainline PCCP’s IRI raw data with the ProVAL
 25-foot sliding base line to identify areas of localized roughness as defined by
 Table 601-2 for deficiencies. Submit to the engineer for approval the locations and
 screen shots for any allowed uncorrected deficiencies in accordance with
 601.03.11.3.2. Although grinding for some areas may be deemed unnecessary by
 the engineer the measured roughness for such areas will still contribute to the total
 IRI for the project. In addition, the Department will check for 1/4 inch bumps at
 locations determined by the engineer. Correct deficiencies in accordance with
 601.03.11.3.2.
 A DOTD inspector will be present for the acceptance testing and will
 immediately receive a copy of the raw data, the “*.erd” file and any files with
 information about the project, the operator, the equipment, the settings, daily preoperation results, and a copy of the IRI results via USB flash drive. In addition to
 the data transferred by USB storage device, provide the engineer a paper copy of the
 IRI report. Acceptance for the project will be in accordance with Tables 601-1 and
 601-2. The Department may elect to perform and utilize independent ride quality
 test results for acceptance at any time.
 601.03.11.4.2 Exclusions: Take the IRI acceptance measurement in
 its entirety, without exclusions. The Department will then review the profile report
 obtained for each lane. In special cases or extenuating circumstances, the engineer
 may isolate or exclude sections of the profile. These include the following:
  Bridges, including the approach slabs
  Curb and gutter sections, just the affected wheel path, and adjacent
 areas
  Manholes, catch basins, valve and junction boxes
  Intersections of a different grade
  Structures located in the roadway which cause abrupt deviations in the
 profile
  Ramps less than 1500 feet
  Sections where the project engineer determines that attaining
 smoothness is beyond the contractor’s reasonable control .
 The roughness in excluded areas will not be included in the total IRI used for
 payment purposes, but shall meet the requirements of 601.03.11.3.2 and Table 601322
 
 2. The quantity represented by the roadway length excluded will not receive any
 bonus pay adjustment for surface tolerance.
 601.03.12 Removing Forms: Keep the forms in place for at least 12 hours
 and until concrete has set sufficiently to avoid damage or prior to opening to traffic
 as allowed by 601.03.13. Remove forms carefully to avoid damage to pavement.
 Repair all superficial damage with mortar composed of one part cement and two
 parts fine aggregates. After removal of forms, immediately cure sides of the slab in
 accordance with 601.03.10.
 601.03.13 Opening to Traffic: Allow traffic on the pavement after 14 days
 or when test specimens, complying with 601.03.7, attain a compressive strength of
 3,000 psi when tested in accordance with DOTD TR 230 or a flexural strength of
 550 psi when tested in accordance with AASHTO T-97. Saw initial stress relief
 joints and clean the pavement prior to opening to traffic. If full width joints are cut,
 seal before opening to traffic.
 601.03.14 Acceptance Requirements:
 601.03.14.1 General: Conduct sampling for DOTD testing on each
 pavement lot for thickness, concrete strength, and surface tolerance. Sample in
 accordance with the DOTD Sampling Manual. Correct all pavement that is
 obviously defective, or remove and replace to full depth, to the satisfaction of the
 engineer. Times and locations will be established by the engineer.
 A pavement lot is an identifiable area of approximately 4,000 square yards paid
 under the same item. The final area of pavement placed is a lot if it is at least 2,000
 square yards; otherwise, it will be included in the previous lot. The engineer may
 redefine the lot limits when sequences of construction prevent timely sampling and
 testing.
 Consider intersections, entrances, crossovers, ramps, and any other identifiable
 placement as separate lots.
 601.03.14.2 Concrete Strength and Thickness:
 601.03.14.2.1 Compressive Strength:
 Determine the 28-day
 compressive strength and thickness of pavements from hardened cores. The
 Department, in accordance with DOTD TR 225, will identify random concrete core
 locations and determine the diameter, thickness, and strength. Cut the cores in the
 presence of a DOTD representative. The DOTD representative will take immediate
 possession of the cores for thickness and strength determinations. Notify the District
 Laboratory Engineer at least five days prior to the start of coring operations.
 The engineer will divide each pavement lot into five equal sections. Obtain one
 core from each section after meeting surface tolerances. Provide additional cores
 required by the Department to isolate thickness, strength or other pavement
 deficiencies, or for recutting of deficient cores at no direct pay. Patch all core holes
 using an approved pavement or structural concrete mixture meeting the requirements
 323
 
 of Section 901. Patch the core holes immediately after coring operations. Finish the
 surface of the patch to match the surrounding pavement. Include the cost of patching
 the core holes in the bid price of the concrete coring.
 When the average strength for the lot is less than 4,000 psi, the contract unit price
 will be adjusted in accordance with Table 601-3. When an individual core indicates
 compressive strength less than 3,000 psi, remove, and replace the entire deficient
 section with concrete of the specified quality. If the Chief Engineer determines that
 the concrete may be left in place, payment for the quantity of concrete represented
 by the deficient core will be made at 50 percent of the contract unit price. Payment
 for the remainder of the lot will be made in accordance with Table 601-3 based on
 the average compressive strength of the remaining sections.
 601.03.14.2.2 Flexural Strength: The 28-day flexural strength
 (modulus of rupture) will only be required when specified in the contract documents.
 Submit a contractor-controlled curing and delivery plan to the engineer for approval.
 Determine flexural strength of pavements from 6-inch by 6-inch by 20 inch cast
 beams. Cast and cure the beams in accordance with TR-226. The Department will
 randomly determine sample frequency and location for casting beams. Cast and
 mark the beams for identification in the presence of a DOTD representative. The
 Department will perform acceptance testing.
 601.03.14.2.3 Thickness: Construct pavement to plan thickness.
 Under thickness will be subject to the payment adjustments shown in Table 601-3.
 For PCCP requiring compressive strength acceptance, determine thickness from
 the cores.
 For PCCP requiring flexural strength acceptance, use a 2-inch core to determine
 thickness. An alternate method may be submitted to the Department for approval.
 The engineer, in calculating average pavement thickness, will consider individual
 measurements in excess of specified thickness by more than 0.25 inch as specified
 thickness plus 0.25 inch.
 Replace with concrete of specified thickness areas deficient in thickness by more
 than 1 inch. If the Chief Engineer determines the deficient area may remain in place,
 payment for the quantity of concrete represented by the deficiency will be made at
 50 percent of the contract unit price. Payment for the remainder of the lot will be in
 accordance with Table 601-3 based on the average thickness of the remaining lot
 segments.
 601.03.14.2.4 Projects with Less Than 2,000 Square Yards of
 Pavement: Cored as required in 601.03.14.2.1 and 601.03.14.2.2 above, or may
 be accepted based on compressive strength cylinders and thickness measurements
 taken by the engineer.
 601.03.14.3 Surface Tolerance: Test in accordance with 601.03.11.
 601.03.14.4 Tolerances along Longitudinal Edges: Check the
 324
 
 pavement edge with a minimum 5-foot straight edge while the concrete is still in a
 fresh state. Do not allow the surface within a 6-inch width to vary more than
 1/4 inch. This tolerance applies to those locations where subsequent paving
 (additional lanes, shoulders, turnouts, ramps, widening, curb and gutters, etc.) is to
 be constructed adjacent to the placed pavement. Correct any edge slump settlement
 before the concrete has hardened. Place fixed side forms at the slab edges when
 correcting deficiencies. If continuously unable to meet tolerance, cease paving
 operations and take corrective action.
 For edges where there will be no adjacent pavement, the tolerance is 1/2 inch in
 6 inches.
 If unable to correct edge slump deficiencies before the concrete has hardened,
 correct as follows.
 601.03.14.5 Edges at Longitudinal Joints: Correct by full depth
 removal and replacement of the pavement edge with tied concrete. Remove the
 pavement by full depth sawing for a width necessary to bring the pavement within
 the required tolerance. The maximum allowable width for removal and replacement
 with adjacent concrete work is 12 inches.
 If the pavement surface corrections require removing more than 12 inches of the
 pavement edge, remove the pavement full depth for one-half of the lane width.
 Replace in accordance with the Department’s full depth concrete pavement patching
 details prior to placing the adjacent pavement.
 Begin and end all removals at a transverse joint.
 601.03.14.6 Edges not along Longitudinal Joints: Correct by full
 depth removal and replacement of the pavement edge with tied concrete for a
 minimum width of 12 inches and to the original width at proper grade. Begin and
 end all removals at a transverse joint.
 601.03.15 Quality Control: The contractor is responsible for all operations
 including but not limited to the production, transporting, placement, joint
 construction, surface finishing, maintenance, and curing of all concrete pavement
 and shoulders constructed in accordance with these specifications. Control the work
 to produce concrete pavement and shoulders that are uniform and conform to the
 plan dimensions and test requirements. Perform whatever tests are necessary to
 ensure the concrete pavement and shoulders comply with these specifications. Use
 construction methods that prevent cracking.
 601.04 MEASUREMENT. The quantities for payment will be the design
 quantities specified in the plans and adjustments thereto. There will be no
 adjustments in plan quantities unless the engineer makes changes to adjust to field
 conditions, plan errors, or if design changes are necessary.
 325
 
 601.05 PAYMENT. Payment will be on a lot basis at the contract unit price per
 square yard, which includes furnishing and placing all materials including tie bars,
 dowel bars, and joint material. Payment for concrete cores taken for thickness and
 strength acceptance is at the contract unit price per each as described in 601.03.14.2.
 There will be no adjustment in the unit price for coring when there are different
 pavement-thicknesses specified. If the pavement does not comply with acceptance
 requirements, adjust unit price payments in accordance with Table 601-3. If there
 are payment adjustments for more than one deficiency, they are cumulative.
 Payment for surface tolerance (IRI) will be in accordance with 601.03.11. Grinding
 is not allowed to achieve incentive payment beyond meeting Table 601-2
 requirements. Progressive partial payments for PCCP are at 100 percent with all IRI
 bonus and penalty assessments at final acceptance.

 retrofitting of dowel bars, full and partial depth pavement patching, cleaning and resealing
 or filling of longitudinal and transverse joints, cleaning and sealing of cracks, and
 undersealing in accordance with these specifications, plan details, and as directed by the
 engineer. Section 602 is not applicable to newly constructed portland cement concrete
 pavement.
 Dispose of removed materials, including concrete pavement, outside the project
 rights-of-way in accordance with 202.02.
 Quality assurance requirements shall be as specified in the latest edition of the
 Department’s publication entitled "Application of Quality ".
 602.02 MATERIALS. Materials for concrete pavement rehabilitation shall
 comply with the requirements of the appropriate subsections. The engineer must
 approve the materials before performing the work.
 602.03 EQUIPMENT. Equipment for concrete pavement rehabilitation
 shall comply with the requirements of the appropriate subsections. The engineer
 will approve equipment and tools necessary for handling materials and performing
 the work. The equipment shall be at the job site sufficiently ahead of the start of
 operations for examination and approval.
 602.04 CLEANING AND FILLING EXISTING LONGITUDINAL
 PAVEMENT JOINTS (≥ 2 INCH WIDTH). Remove joint sealants in longitudinal
 joints, two inches and wider, in existing concrete pavement and fill the joints in
 accordance with the plans or as directed and as follows. Clean joints and adjacent
 pavement surfaces of existing sealants, incompressibles and debris to the
 satisfaction of the engineer in accordance with the plans by sandblasting. Blow the
 joint dry, free of any debris by compressed air just prior to filling. The air
 compressor will be equipped with an approved oil and water trap. Dry the joints
 before filling. Fill prepared joints within 24 hours. Reclean joints that have become
 contaminated or dirty before filling as directed.
 329
 
 Fill the joints with an epoxy concrete consisting of a mixture of epoxy resin
 system and thoroughly dry fine aggregate. The epoxy resin system shall be Type I
 Grade 1 complying with Section 1017. The fine aggregate shall consist of packaged
 concrete or mortar sand complying with 1003.08.1. Prior to mixing, ensure that the
 sand is in oven dried condition. The mixture proportions of the epoxy concrete shall
 be one part epoxy resin system to approximately four parts fine aggregate, by dry
 volume. The final mix proportions shall be such that during placement the slump of
 the mixture will allow the material to fill all voids and be consolidated and finished.
 Mix the epoxy resin system and fine aggregate in equipment and by methods that
 produce a homogenous mixture.
 Place reinforcing steel in the joint as shown on the plans. Cut the reinforcing
 steel at transverse joints. Establish transverse joints in the epoxy concrete by
 using inserts or sawing, and then sealing.
 Protect existing transverse joints from intrusion of epoxy concrete. If epoxy
 concrete gets into the transverse joints, immediately clean the joints of epoxy
 concrete to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 The filled joint shall remain closed to traffic until, in the engineer's opinion,
 the epoxy concrete and joint sealant have satisfactorily cured.
 602.05 CLEANING AND RESEALING EXISTING LONGITUDINAL AND
 TRANSVERSE PAVEMENT JOINTS. Remove joint sealants in longitudinal
 and transverse joints of existing concrete pavement and reseal the joints in
 accordance with the plans or as directed and as follows. Clean joints and adjacent
 pavement surfaces of existing sealants, incompressibles, and debris in accordance
 with the plans to the satisfaction of the engineer. Clean joint faces by sandblasting
 and blow free of any debris by compressed air just prior to resealing. Make a
 minimum of one pass with the blasting nozzle held at an angle close to the
 surface [1-2 inches] along each reservoir face. The air blowing operation is to
 proceed in one direction (forward) to prevent recontamination of the joint. Equip
 the air compressor with an approved oil and water trap. Dry the joint before
 resealing. Reseal prepared joints within 24 hours. Reclean any contaminated joints
 before sealing, as directed.
 Resealing materials shall comply with 1005.02.1. Install resealing materials in
 accordance with plan details and the manufacturer's recommendations. Use an
 appropriate sized backer r o d material for the joint size complying with 1005.02.1.
 While sealing joints, seal small crushed corners, not repaired by other methods,
 with hot poured sealant to the satisfaction of the engineer at no direct pay.
 Keep the resealed joint closed to traffic until the sealant has satisfactorily cured
 to tack free.
 330
 
 602.06 CLEANING AND SEALING CRACKS. Clean and seal longitudinal,
 diagonal, and transverse cracks in accordance with the plans or as directed and as
 follows. The minimum width of the crack to be sealed shall be 3/8-inch at the
 pavement surface. The engineer wil l designate which cracks are to be sealed.
 Clean cracks by sandblast or water blast. Route cracks, less than 1/2 inch, to form
 a sealant reservoir approximately 1/2 inch wide by 1/2 inch deep, and blow free
 of sand or water by compressed air just prior to sealing. Make a minimum of one
 pass with the blasting nozzle held at an angle close to the surface [1 - 2 inches] along
 each reservoir face. Proceed in one direction (forward) with the blowing operation
 to prevent recontamination of the joint. Equip the air compressor with an approved
 oil and water trap. Keep the crack dry before sealing. Seal prepared cracks within
 24 hours. Reclean any contaminated cracks before sealing, as directed. Seal cracks
 with a hot poured sealant complying with 1005.02.1, installed in accordance with
 the manufacturer's recommendations.
 Keep the sealed cracks closed to traffic until the hot poured sealant has
 satisfactorily cured to tack free.
 602.07 FULL DEPTH CORNER PATCHING OF JOINTED CONCRETE
 PAVEMENT. Remove and replace to full-depth, portland cement concrete
 pavement corner breaks at locations shown on the plans or as directed and as follows.

 602.16.5.2 Construction Requirements. Install the dowel bars as
 follows:
 Saw cut slots in the pavement parallel to the centerline of the roadway to a depth
 sufficient to place the center of the dowel bar at mid-depth in the pavement. Multiple
 saw cuts parallel to the centerline may be required to properly remove the material
 from the slot. Make the saw cuts for the slots at each transverse joint such that the
 dowel bars can be positioned parallel to the roadway centerline and surface in
 accordance with plan details.
 Jackhammers used to break loose concrete shall not be larger than the 30-pound
 class. If the 30-pound jack hammer damages the pavement, use a lighter weight
 hammer.
 Sand blast and clean all exposed surfaces and cracks in the slot prior to bar
 installation. Equip air compressors with approved oil and moisture traps.
 Fill the transverse contraction joint on the bottom and the sides of the slot with
 silicone caulk. Prior to patching, clean all caulking material from the bottom and
 sides of the slot that will result in breaking of the bond with the patching material.
 Lightly oil or grease the dowel bars prior to placement. The bar chairs shall
 provide a minimum of 1/2-inch clearance between the bottom of the dowel bar and
 the bottom of the slot. Center the dowel bars over the transverse joint. Place the bar
 in the middle of the slot to the depth shown on the plans, parallel to the roadway
 centerline and the roadway surface. The chairs shall hold the dowel bar securely in
 place during placement of the patching mix.
 Place a 1/4-inch thick foam core board at the middle of the dowel bar to maintain
 the transverse contraction joint. Cut or remove the existing joint sealant if necessary
 to accommodate the foam core board. The foam core board shall fit tightly around
 the dowel bar and to the bottom and edges of the slot. Place the top of the foam
 344
 
 core board flush with the top surface of the concrete pavement. The foam core board
 shall remain in a vertical position and be tight to all edges during the placement of
 the patching material.
 Thoroughly moisten all surfaces on the sawed slot immediately prior to filling
 with patch compound unless the patching material manufacturer recommends the
 slot surface to be dry. Take care to prevent standing water in the slot. Remove
 all excess water with compressed air.
 Fill the slot (with the installed dowel bar, chairs, foam core board, and silicone
 in place) with an approved patching material. Mix the patching material in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and with mixing equipment
 approved by the engineer. Vibrate the patching material with a small hand held
 vibrator capable of thoroughly consolidating the patching compound into the slot
 and around the dowel bar. Trowel finish and cure the top surface of the filled slot.
 Cure the patched areas as recommended by the patching material manufacturer.
 Provide six 2-inch cube molds in accordance with ASTM C 192 for sampling
 and testing the patching material once for each 4 hours of production or a minimum
 of once per day. Make test specimens in accordance with ASTM C 192. If the
 compressive strengths are not being met, cease production and take corrective
 measures to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 Allow the patching material to cure for a minimum of four hours before
 placing any vehicle loads on the repair or as directed.
 Saw the transverse joints then seal with a sealant complying with 1005.02.3 in
 accordance with plan details and the manufacturer’s directions. Use an appropriate
 sized backer rod material for the joint size complying with 1005.02.1. Use an
 Approved Materials List backer rod material.

 701.02.7 Quality Assurance for Pipe: Manufacturing plants will
 be periodically inspected for compliance with specified manufacturing
 methods, and material samples will be randomly obtained for laboratory
 testing for verification of manufacturing lots. Materials approved at the
 manufacturing plant will be subject to visual acceptance inspections at the
 jobsite or point of delivery.
 701.03 EXCAVATION. For all trench excavation, ensure that the sides of
 the trench are stable, as evidenced by the sides of the trench being able to
 maintain a vertical cut face. Consider the sides unstable if fissures develop
 in the face of or adjacent to the open excavation; if the edge of the excavation
 subsides; if material ravels, spalls, or slumps from the face of the excavation;
 or if the bottom of the excavation bulges or heaves. In all cases of apparent
 distress, or when the trench excavation exceeds 5 feet in depth, sloping,
 benching, and shoring will be required in accordance with the OSHA trench
 safety standards, 29 CFR § 1926 (P). Consider these and any more stringent
 trench safety standards as minimum contract requirements.
 Submission of bid and subsequent award of contract will serve as
 certification that all trench excavation in excess of 5 feet will be in
 compliance LA R.S. 48:251.1.
 Consider all available geotechnical information when designing the
 trench excavation safety system, including groundwater. Evaluate trench
 stability due to the effects of surcharge loads from adjacent structures, stored
 materials and equipment, or traffic. Ensure that excavated material is placed
 a sufficient distance back from the trench edge to preclude material from
 falling back into the trench, otherwise provide an adequate retention system.
 Ensure that the bottom width of a pipe trench provides at least 18 inches
 of clearance on each side of the pipe. In accordance with 202.02,
 satisfactorily dispose of surplus excavated material that does not conform to
 the requirements of 203.06.1. Control rainfall runoff or excess moisture by
 proper selection of backfill materials, dewatering sumps, wells, well points,
 or other approved procedures during excavation, bedding installation, overexcavated trench backfilling, pipe placement, and pipe backfill.
 701.03.1 Over-Excavation: When encountering unsuitable soils as
 defined in 203.04, or a stable, non-yielding foundation cannot be obtained at
 either the established pipe grade or at the grade established for placement of
 the bedding, remove unstable or unsuitable soils below this grade and replace
 with granular material complying with 1003.09, bedding materials
 complying with 1003.10, or Type A backfill complying with 701.08.1. Place
 all granular backfill materials below the established pipe or bedding grade in
 353
 
 lifts less than 8 inches thick. Compact sufficiently with a dynamic
 mechanical hand compaction device over the surface of each lift to form a
 stable, non-yielding foundation at the surface of the established bedding or
 pipe grade.
 When encountering rock, remove the rock below grade and replace it with
 granular material, bedding materials, or Type A backfill. Provide a
 compacted earth cushion thickness under the pipe of at least 1/2 inch per foot
 of fill height over the top of the pipe with a minimum thickness of 8 inches.
 Place all granular backfill materials below the established pipe or bedding
 grade in lifts less than 8 inches thick. Sufficiently compact with a dynamic
 mechanical hand operated compaction device over the surface of each lift to
 form a stable, non-yielding foundation at the surface of the established
 bedding or pipe grade.
 Materials used to backfill in an over-excavated portion of a trench do not
 require encasement in a geotextile fabric.
 701.04 FORMING PIPE BED. When specifying bedding material,
 construct in accordance with Section 726. Materials allowed for bedding
 shall comply with 1003.10 or may be type a backfill materials. When
 specifying bedding materials, perform additional excavation below
 established pipe grade and place the bedding material in lifts less than
 8 inches thick. Lightly compact with a dynamic hand compaction device
 over the surface of each lift.
 When the bottom of the pipe is not laid in a trench but constructed above
 natural soils, construct a uniform bed as specified for the bottom of a trench.
 In lieu of removing and replacing unstable soil with granular material,
 bedding material, or Type A backfill material, a cabled articulated concrete
 block mattress meeting the requirements of Section 712 may be used with a
 6-inch layer of bedding material between the pipe and the mattress installed
 in accordance with Section 726. Excavate the trench to a depth 6 inches plus
 the thickness of the mattress below the grade line of the pipe. Join adjacent
 mattress segments together to form a continuous supporting foundation
 beneath the pipe to the satisfaction of the engineer.
 701.05 LAYING PIPE. Begin laying pipe at the downstream end of the
 line. Ensure that the pipe is in contact with the foundation throughout its
 length. Place bell or grooved ends of pipe and outside circumferential laps
 of riveted metal pipe facing upstream. Place riveted seam metal pipe with
 longitudinal laps at sides. Pipes in each continuous line shall have the same
 354
 
 wall thickness. Handle metal pipes provided with lifting lugs only by these
 lugs.
 After laying pipe and before placing backfill, the engineer will inspect
 the pipe for alignment, grade, integrity of joints, and coating damage.
 701.06 JOINING PIPE.
 701.06.1 Joint Usage:
 701.06.1.1 Type 1 (T1) Joints: Use Type 1 joints for side drains
 under driveways and similar installations.
 701.06.1.2 Type 2 (T2) Joints: Use Type 2 joints for cross drains
 under roadways, including turnouts.
 701.06.1.3 Type 3 (T3) Joints: Use Type 3 joints for storm drain
 systems, flumes, and siphons.
 701.06.2 Concrete Pipe: Concrete pipe may be either bell and spigot
 or tongue and groove. Join pipe sections so that ends are fully entered and
 inner surfaces are flush and even.
 Use an approved mechanical pipe puller for joining pipes over 36 inches
 in diameter. For pipe 36 inches or less in diameter, use any approved method
 for joining pipe that does not damage the pipe.
 Joints shall comply with 1016.01.1 and 1018.03. Seal with gasket
 material installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 701.06.3 Metal Pipe: Firmly join metal pipe by coupling bands.
 Center bands over the joint.
 For Type 1 joints, place approved gasket material in one corrugation
 recess on each side of the joint at the coupling band and on each band
 connection in such manner to prevent leakage.
 When Type 2 or 3 joints are specified, join metal pipe sections as follows:
 701.06.3.1 General: Seal band joints with gasket material. Place
 gasket material in accordance with the plan details.
 701.06.3.2 Circular Section: Connecting bands shall be of an
 approved design. Install in accordance with plan details.
 701.06.3.3 Arch Section: Connecting bands shall be a minimum
 of 12 inches wide for a pipe arch less than 36 inches round equivalent
 diameter, and a minimum of 21 inches wide for pipe arch 36 inches round
 equivalent diameter and greater. Connect bands at the ends by approved
 angle or strap connections. Use two-piece connecting bands for a pipe arch
 36 inches round equivalent diameter and greater.
 701.06.4 Plastic Pipe: Joints for plastic pipe shall be bell and spigot
 or split coupling bands.
 355
 
 701.06.4.1 Bell and Spigot Type Joint System: Join pipe
 sections so that ends are fully entered and inner surfaces are flush and even.
 Use any approved method for joining pipe that does not damage the pipe.
 After joints approval, seal with a rubber gasket material complying with
 1007.08.4.1.
 701.06.4.2 Split Coupling Type Joint System: Split coupling
 bands shall comply with all dimensional and material requirements of
 1006.06. Center the bands over the joint. Secure the split coupling band to
 the pipe with a minimum of five stainless steel or other approved corrosion
 resistant bands.
 After joints approval, seal with gasket material. Place gasket material in
 the first two corrugation recesses on each side of the pipe connection. Also
 place gasket material on each band connection to prevent leakage. When
 using flexible plastic gasket material, it shall be a minimum of 1/2 inch in
 size. Tighten the bands to create overlap of the band and adequately
 compress the gasket material.
 701.06.5 Connections: Use approved connections when joining new
 pipes to existing pipes. When using concrete collars to extend the ends of
 existing pipes that have been damaged or to join different types or sizes of
 pipes, construct the concrete collars in accordance with plan details, the
 applicable requirements of Section 901, and as directed.
 701.06.6 Geotextile Fabric Wrapped Pipe Joints: For concrete,
 metal, and plastic pipes, use Types 2 and 3 joints wrapped with geotextile
 fabric for a minimum of 12 inches on each side of the joint for pipe 36 inches
 or less in diameter and a minimum of 18 inches on each side of the joint for
 pipe greater than 36 inches in diameter. Wrap the ends of the fabric around
 the circumference of the pipe and overlap at least 10 inches. Secure the
 edges and ends of fabric for the entire circumference of the pipe.
 701.07 RELAYING PIPE. If specified or directed, remove existing pipes
 and relay suitable sections as specified for new pipes.
 701.08 BACKFILLING.
 701.08.1 General: Prior to backfilling, remove pipes found to be
 damaged or out of alignment or grade; reinstall or replace.
 Type A backfill material shall be stone, recycled portland cement
 concrete, flowable fill, or RAP.
 Type B backfill materials are select soils. Select soils are natural soils
 with a maximum PI of 20, a maximum liquid limit of 35, and a maximum
 356
 
 organic content of 5 percent. Soils with a silt content of 50 percent or greater
 and also a PI of 10 or less will not be allowed. Where Type B backfill
 materials are called for, Type A backfill materials may be substituted.
 When using corrugated metal pipe, the backfill material shall be tested
 and shall have a resistivity greater than 1500 ohm-cm and a pH greater than 5
 when tested in accordance with DOTD TR 429 and DOTD TR 430
 respectively.
 When using Type A backfill material, place geotextile fabric to surround
 this backfill in accordance with 726.03 between the aggregate backfill
 material and all other natural or placed soils in the trench or embankment.
 Take care to prevent damage to geotextile fabric during placement of backfill
 material. For concrete pipe, enclose not only the initial backfill with the
 fabric, but wrap the fabric over the top of the pipe with at least 12 inches of
 overlap.
 When using a trench box or trench sheeting in unstable soils and/or for
 worker safety, and when moved during backfilling operations, immediately
 fill and provide additional compaction of the disturbed zone of backfill to
 the satisfaction of the engineer.
 Initial backfill is a structural backfill encasing the pipe from the bottom
 of the pipe to the springline for concrete pipe and to a point one foot above
 the top of the pipe for both metal and plastic pipe. Final backfill is not a
 structural backfill. Final backfill extends from the top of the initial backfill
 to the top of the natural ground or subgrade in cut areas or to the top of
 existing ground in fill areas. Consider and treat any fill required above the
 final backfill as embankment.
 701.08.2 Backfill Applications: For projects using the A+B+C
 bidding method where considering rigid and flexible pavement alternates,
 use the backfill application in 701.08.2.2 for either rigid or flexible
 pavements.

 optimum moisture content in accordance with DOTD TR 415 or 418. Place
 and compact RAP materials in a slightly moist condition.
 Determine the maximum dry density of initial or final Type B backfill
 under all paved areas which are to be under traffic in accordance with DOTD
 TR 415 or TR 418. Determine in-place density in accordance with DOTD
 TR 401. Place initial and final Type B backfill under all paved areas under
 traffic, at or near optimum moisture content in accordance with DOTD
 TR 415 or TR 418. Compact each layer by approved methods prior to the
 placement of a subsequent layer. The engineer will approve the compaction
 method upon validation that such method, including moisture control, will
 achieve at least 95 percent of maximum dry density in accordance with
 DOTD TR 401. Density testing on subsequent backfill layers may be waived
 by the engineer if installation has been in accordance with approved
 compaction methods and performance has been continuously satisfactory.
 Place initial and final backfill in unpaved or paved areas, such as shoulders
 or driveways, evenly and compact along the length of the culvert, pipe, or
 drain from the top of the initial backfill to the top of the subgrade. Compact
 layered backfill to at least the density of the adjoining existing soils or the
 compaction required of the laterally adjoining layers of soil immediately

 701.09 INSPECTION OF PIPES. After completion of embankment and
 prior to roadway surfacing, the engineer shall inspect pipes for proper
 359
 
 alignment and integrity of joints. Correct any misaligned pipe or defective
 joints at no direct pay.
 701.09.1 Plastic Pipe: Test installed plastic pipe to ensure that
 vertical deflections do not exceed 5.0 percent. Maximum allowable
 deflections shall be governed by the mandrel requirements stated herein.
 Perform deflection tests no sooner than 30 calendar days after installation
 and compaction of backfill. Clean the pipe and inspect for offsets and
 obstructions prior to testing.
 For pipe 36 inches and less in diameter, pull a mandrel through the pipe
 by hand to ensure that maximum allowable deflections have not been
 exceeded. The mandrel must be approved by the engineer prior to use. Use
 of an unapproved, mandrel or a mandrel altered or modified after approval
 mandrel will invalidate the test. If the mandrel fails to pass through the pipe,
 the pipe is over-deflected.
 Unless otherwise permitted, uncover over-deflected pipe and, if not
 damaged, reinstall. Do not reinstall damaged pipe. Remove and replace
 with new pipe. Any pipe subjected to any method or process other than
 removal, which attempts, even successfully, to reduce or cure any overdeflection, shall be removed and replaced with new pipe.
 Use a rigid, nonadjustable, odd-numbered leg (minimum 9 legs) mandrel
 having a length not less than its nominal diameter or 24 inches, whichever is
 less. The minimum diameter at any point shall be 5.0 percent less than the
 base inside diameter of the pipe being tested. The mandrel shall be fabricated
 of steel, aluminum, or other approved material fitted with pulling rings at
 each end. The nominal pipe size and outside diameter of the mandrel shall
 be stamped or engraved on some segment other than a runner. Furnish a
 suitable carrying case.
 For pipe larger than 36 inches in diameter, determine deflection by a
 method approved by the engineer. If a mandrel is selected, the minimum
 diameter, length, and other requirements shall conform to the above
 requirements.
 Conduct mandrel testing in the presence of the engineer. Mandrel testing
 shall be at no direct pay.
 701.09.2 Metal Pipe: If the inside diameter of metal pipe or rise
 dimension of metal pipe arch deflects more than 5.0 percent from original
 dimensions, remove and reinstall the metal pipes or pipe arches, unless they
 do not rebound or are damaged. Remove pipes or pipe arches which are
 damaged or do not rebound; and replace at no direct pay. Measurement of
 deflection will be made by the engineer away from rerolled ends.

 requirements for percent air, compressive strength and unit weight are for
 laboratory designs only and are not intended for jobsite acceptance requirements
 unless otherwise directed by the project engineer. For early opening to traffic and
 expedited placement circumstances, the maximum or minimum required strength
 shall be attained in the desired time frame.
 
 710.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Before placement,
 provide temporary end dams or soil berms as directed by the engineer to
 confine the flowable fill. Place flowable fill to the lines and grades shown
 on the plans or as directed. Where flotation or misalignment may occur due
 to hydrostatic pressure, assure correct alignment and placement of the
 encased structure by using straps, soil anchors, or other approved means of
 restraint. Protect flowable fill from freezing for 36 hours after placement.
 Place flowable fill by chute, pumping or other methods approved by the
 engineer. Due to flowable fill’s liquid condition, take into account the
 hydrostatic pressure on adjacent structures on deep fills where multiple lifts
 may be required. While in a liquid state, flowable fill in deep excavations is
 in a quick condition, and shall be protected until hardening occurs. For early
 opening to traffic and expedited placement circumstances, perform trial
 batches to verify compressive strength for the required time frame before
 placing under load. Flowable fill will not require field sampling or testing
 392
 
 other than the approved trial batch mix design, unless otherwise directed by
 the project engineer.
 710.04 MEASUREMENT. Flowable fill will be measured by the
 cubic yard by batch tickets as adjusted by the project engineer.

 Stone riprap shall not disintegrate upon exposure to the elements or be easily
 broken from handling, and shall be reasonably free from earth and other
 foreign materials. When tested in accordance with AASHTO T 85, the solid
 weight of stone shall be at least 155 pounds per cubic foot (based on bulk
 specific gravity). The least dimension of any individual stone shall be at
 least one-third its maximum dimension. Each shipment of stone shall be
 reasonably well graded within the specified limits.
 Recycled concrete may be used as riprap unless otherwise indicated in
 711.02.1, provided its solid weight is at least 140 pounds per cubic foot
 (based on bulk specific gravity) and free of protruding reinforcement.
 Stockpiles of recycled concrete shall be source approved prior to use and
 kept separate from other materials. Stockpiles shall be uniform and free of
 soil, debris, excessive amounts of asphalt materials, and foreign matter.
 Once a stockpile has been approved as an acceptable source of material, do
 not add material without further approval.
 Visually inspect riprap at the source, project site, or both to control
 gradation.
 Any difference of opinion between the engineer and contractor will be
 resolved by checking the gradation of two random truckloads (or equivalent
 size samples). Furnish equipment, labor, and a sorting site at no direct pay.

 14 calendar days in advance of the needed revision. If the requested revision
 falls within the scope of the existing contract drawings, the engineer may
 approve the revision. If the engineer determines that the requested revision
 is outside the scope of the contract drawings, the contractor will be required
 to submit a change order request. The change order drawings shall conform
 to the following:
 1. Letter size original contract drawings. Submit change order drawings
 on high quality, white 8 1/2 x 11 inch letter size paper. The drawings may be
 hand drafted or computer drafted and arranged in landscape format on the
 page. The text and drawings must be legible after reproduction on standard
 reproduction equipment. Left, bottom, and right hand margins shall be at
 least 1/2 inch and the top margin shall be 1 inch.
 2. Full size original contract drawings. Submit change order drawings on
 high quality, 4-mil, double-matte film using a plotting or reproduction
 process that fuses the graphics to ensure durability. Repeated handling and
 friction due to stacking of plans shall not smear, flake or rub off the graphics.
 Improper plotter settings and plotter wear may cause inconsistent durability
 of the drawings. Test samples of the submitted drawings for durability.
 Advance samples of matte films may be submitted for approval; however,
 the contract plans will be tested separately. Failures will result in rejection
 of the submittal. Drawing sizes shall comply with 801.05.2.2.1.
 3. Lettering on change order drawings shall be of adequate size to
 facilitate a 50 percent reduction of plans. Make additions or changes with a
 permanent type of waterproof ink made for this purpose. If revised crosssections are required, plot the cross-sections on standard cross-section
 412
 
 sheets. As a minimum, draw the ground line, centerline elevation, and station
 numbers in ink; the remaining information may be drawn in pencil.
 Regardless of size, identify all required change order drawings and
 documents with the DOTD project title and project number. Sign and seal
 all plans and calculations by a Louisiana licensed civil engineer.
 All plans submitted by the contractor shall conform to these
 specifications and standards. The DOTD Chief Engineer may reject any
 plans not conforming to these standards.
 Revisions to the TCP that are determined to be outside the scope of the
 original contract drawings must be approved by the DOTD District Traffic
 Engineering Division prior to implementation of the requested revision. In
 some cases on high traffic routes or high priority projects, the revisions must
 be approved by the HQ Traffic Operations Engineer.
 713.09.4
 Traffic Control Diary: The TCS shall maintain a project
 traffic control diary using the Department’s Site Manager Program. As a
 requirement of 713.09.2.8, keep the traffic control diary current on a daily
 basis and electronically sign each daily entry. A date stamp is required on
 each diary, so it is imperative to complete these diaries in a timely manner.
 Completion and maintaining of the daily diaries in accordance with the plans
 and specifications is subject to the LA R.S. 14:133 “Filing or Maintaining
 False Public Records.” Photographs and videotapes may be used to
 supplement the written text.
 Make the traffic control diary available at all times for inspection by the
 engineer. Review the diary with the engineer on a weekly basis and submit
 a copy to the engineer on a monthly basis. Failure to complete the diary on
 a daily basis or make the diary available for review shall result in a deduction
 from payments for the work of $150 per calendar day as stipulated damages
 for each day the diary is not completed or maintained. On days when the
 Department’s Site Manager Program is unavailable, either due to location or
 operation, the TCS shall make arrangements with the approval of the Project
 Engineer to submit the traffic control diaries daily. Failure to submit the
 monthly copy of the diary to the engineer shall result in the withholding of
 the next partial payment until the past due diaries are submitted. Submitted
 diaries that indicate that contemporary daily record keeping has not been
 maintained, as determined by the engineer, the Department’s Work Zone
 Engineer, or the Department’s Statewide Traffic Control Specialist shall
 result in a deduction of $150 for each such deficiency as stipulated damages
 from payments for the work. The lack of a weekly review by the engineer
 shall not relieve the contractor from the assessment of stipulated damages
 for its failure to maintain a daily traffic control diary. The traffic control
 413
 
 diary is part of pay item 713 and shall become the property of the Department
 at the completion of the project.
 The contractor, with the approval of the engineer, the Department’s Work
 Zone Engineer, or the Department’s Statewide Traffic Control Specialist,
 may cease the requirement for a traffic control diary when:
 1. The project has been partially accepted and/or no remaining work exists
 on the project site that impacts the travelling public or,
 2. When all signs and barricades are removed at the conclusion of the
 project.
 When referring to the daily completion of the dairy, it is meant that the
 TCS shall complete the diary by the end of the following day except as
 follows:
 1. If the contractor does not work on Saturday, the Friday and Saturday
 diaries shall be entered into SiteManager no later than Monday morning at 9:00
 am.
 2. If the contractor works on Saturday, the Friday diary shall be entered by
 the end of the day Saturday, but the Saturday diary shall be entered no later
 than Monday at 9:00 am. The Sunday diary shall still be entered by the end of
 the day Monday.
 713.09.5 Inspection of Traffic Control: The TCS shall be
 responsible for the inspection of all traffic control devices every calendar
 day that traffic control devices are in use. This inspection may be delegated
 to the TCT, except for the conditions described in 713.09.2.1 above, where
 the TCS shall conduct the inspections himself. Regardless, the TCS shall be
 stationed within one hour of the jobsite. Use the Quality Guidelines for Work
 Zone Traffic Control Devices standard by the American Traffic Safety
 Services Association (ATSSA) to evaluate the condition of the traffic control
 devices to determine if they are acceptable for use. Provide for the
 immediate repair, cleaning, or replacement of any traffic control devices not
 functioning as required to ensure the safety of the motorist and construction
 personnel and/or not meeting the ATSSA standard.
 Conduct inspection of the traffic control devices by the TCS at the
 beginning and end of each workday, and as scheduled or directed by the
 engineer during the workday. Inspect the traffic control devices by the TCS
 on weekends, holidays, or other non-work days at least once per day. Inspect
 traffic control devices by the TCS at least once a week during nighttime
 periods and the same night after any modifications or changes have been
 made in the traffic control devices.
 
 414
 
 713.09.6 Failure to Comply: The engineer, the Department’s
 Work Zone Engineer, or the Department’s Statewide Traffic Control
 Specialist may suspend all or part of the contractor’s operation(s) for failure
 to comply with the approved “Traffic Control Plan” or failure to correct
 unsafe traffic conditions within a reasonable period of time after such
 notification is given to the contractor in writing. If major traffic control
 deficiencies require immediate corrective action for the safety of the
 travelling public, the engineer, the Department’s Work Zone Engineer, or
 the Department’s Statewide Traffic Control Specialist may completely
 suspend the contractor’s operations. This suspension can either be spoken
 or written, but if spoken, shall be followed up in writing as soon as practical.
 The Department reserves the right to revoke or de-certify the TCS for gross
 neglect of these duties. At this point, the TCS shall retake a Department
 approved TCS course and shall be subject to a 90-day probationary period at
 the discretion of the Department.
 In the event that the contractor does not take appropriate action to bring
 the deficient traffic control into compliance with the approved traffic control
 plan or to correct the unsafe traffic conditions, the Department may proceed
 with the corrective action using its own forces, and such costs will be
 deducted from payments owed to the contractor.
 If the contractor’s operations are suspended, the normal assessment of
 contract time will not cease for the period required to correct these unsafe
 conditions and traffic control deficiencies. The contractor will not be
 relieved of the responsibility to provide traffic control safety to the traveling
 public when a project is under full or partial project suspension. When a
 project is under suspension due to the contractor’s failure to comply with this
 section, or when the contract is under stipulated damages, continue to
 provide traffic control management. No additional measurement or payment
 will be made. If suspensions or partial suspensions are requested by the
 contractor, the additional traffic control management costs will be at no
 expense to the Department.
 713.09.7 Engineer Modifications: The provisions included in the
 plans and specifications for handling and controlling traffic during
 construction may be changed by the engineer, with the approval of the
 DOTD District Traffic Operations Engineer, due to actual field conditions
 encountered. Such changes will be made by written instruction to the
 contractor and be considered an amendment of the plans and specifications
 as of the date of the change.

 714.03 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Cut sod
 with approved sod cutters. Mow the designated area when necessary. Cut
 sod to a minimum soil depth of 11/2 inches for field grown grass and 1 inch
 for nursery grown grass. Cut to a uniform width and in convenient lengths
 for handling. Retain soil on roots of sod when excavating, hauling, and
 planting. Obtain the services of an established soil testing entity to
 coordinate soil sampling, perform testing and analyses, and prepare
 recommendations for materials and procedures to be used during the preplanting phase of new turf establishment. When practical, perform soil
 testing early enough to permit agricultural lime or other additives (if
 required) to be applied sufficiently in advance of planting so that the soil pH
 adjustment will occur before planting. Test and analyze samples to
 determine pH and fertility conditions.
 Use the test results and
 recommendations to determine the quantities of agricultural lime and
 fertilizer required for pre-planting applications. Furnish a copy of the test
 report with recommendations to the engineer. Testing will be at no direct
 pay. Consider probable time of application when making agricultural lime
 recommendations.

 containing no more than 50 square yards of slab sod. Cover the sod and haul
 to the planting site with soil intact. Off-load sod and place as close as
 practical to the planting site.
 714.05 PLANTING. Pulverize areas to receive sod to a depth of at least
 3 inches then level the surface and clear the area of weeds, grass, stones, and
 other debris. If required, add lime when the area is being pulverized.
 Broadcast approximately 90 percent of the fertilizer over the area to receive
 sod, and broadcast the remaining 10 percent over sod after placing and
 rolling. Upon delivery to the planting site, transfer sod onto the surface soil.
 Water sod and/or areas to be sodded as directed. Place sod with no space
 between edges. Stagger slab and roll edges to avoid a continuous seam along
 the line of flow. Along the edges of such staggered areas, do not offset
 individual strips less than 6 inches. Pull by hand all slab edges that do not
 fit closely together without stretching or tearing. Peg when necessary. When
 directed, top dress the sod surface with sand to smooth-out uneven spots.
 714.06 ROLLING. Roll sod after planting with smooth drum sod rollers.
 Where rolling is impractical, tamp sod by approved hand methods.
 714.07 WATERING. Watering shall be the responsibility of the
 contractor unless otherwise noted. Keep all sodded areas thoroughly watered
 for a minimum of 60 calendar days after installation. Water shall not contain
 elements toxic to the plant life. Water immediately after completing each
 day of sod installation. Water every day, preferably in the morning. After
 the first week, reduce watering to every other day, tapering off to just twice
 a week by the third week. Do not drive watering trucks over newly installed
 turf areas. All watering will be at no direct pay.
 714.08 PERIOD OF ESTABLISHMENT – SODDING. The sod
 establishment period to obtain a healthy stand of grass plants shall begin on
 the first day that sod is placed under the contract and shall end 60 calendar
 days after the last day of the sodding operation. Provide a written calendar

 submit a pesticide treatment plan to the engineer for approval by the District
 Roadside Development Coordinator. The contractor will be responsible for
 the application of any approved chemicals.
 714.09 SATISFACTORY STAND OF GRASS PLANTS. The
 Department will evaluate sod for species and health. All sod must be moist
 and growing at the time of acceptance. A satisfactory stand of sod from the
 sodding operation shall be living sod, uniform in color and leaf texture. Bare
 spots shall not exceed 2 inches square. Joints between sod pieces shall be
 tight and free from weeds and other undesirable growth.
 Repair or reinstall unsatisfactory areas of sod and repair eroded areas. If
 at the end of the establishment period, the growth or stand of the sod is
 unacceptable, the sod will be rejected.
 714.10 MEASUREMENT. Sodding will be measured by the square yard

 plans including botanical name, common name, quantity, height, caliper, etc.
 Sizes of stock shown are the minimum acceptable sizes.
 719.05.5 Quality and Source of Plants: Furnish nursery grown
 plants, unless written permission is obtained to use selected native stock.
 This permission will be granted only if native stock is better suited or
 superior in quality to plants obtained from a nursery.
 Furnish plants and trees that equal or exceed the measurements specified
 in the Plant List. Measure before pruning, with branches in normal position.
 Dimensions for height and spread refer to the main body of the plant and not
 from branch tip to branch tip. The determining measurements for trees shall
 be caliper and/or height as described in the Plant List. Measure caliper of
 438
 
 the trunk 6 inches above the ground level for sizes up to and including
 4 inches. If the caliper at 6 inches above the ground level exceeds 4 inches,
 the caliper should be measured at 12 inches above the ground. Trees shall
 have a habit of growth which is normal for the species. Furnish plants that
 are healthy, vigorous, and free from insects, diseases, and injuries. Do not
 trim or cut leaders or main branches of trees.
 719.05.6 Balled and Burlapped Plants: Balled and burlapped
 plants shall be dug with firm, natural balls of soil of sufficient diameter and
 depth to encompass the fibrous and feeding root system necessary for full
 recovery of the plant. Furnish balls that are firmly wrapped with burlap or
 similar material and bound with twine, cord, or wire. Water balled and
 burlapped plants prior to transportation and keep moist until planted.
 719.05.7 Container Grown Plants: Reject container grown stock
 which has become pot bound or in which the plant is out of proportion
 (larger) to the size of the container. Furnish stock with a fibrous, cohesive
 root system. Do not remove container grown plants from the container until
 just before planting and take care to prevent root system damage. Water
 container grown plants prior to transportation and keep moist until planted.
 719.05.8 Handling and Storage: Protect balled and burlapped plants
 from drying out by covering the root system with mulch, wood chips, or
 suitable materials; water the root system and foliage as necessary. Protect
 plants from drying winds and sun as directed.

 15.Dead plants and plants otherwise not complying with these
 specifications.
 Replace rejected material with new plant material of the same kind at no
 direct pay.
 719.06 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 719.06.1 Seasonal Operations: Unless otherwise directed by the
 engineer in writing, the planting season is between November 1 and April 15.
 Suspend work when the ambient temperature falls below 32°F, excessive
 wind velocity, frozen or saturated ground, or continuation of prevailing
 weather would likely cause unsatisfactory results. Complete planting as
 early as practical in the planting season.
 When the only landscape work on the project consists of shrub planting
 at dead-end road installations, perform planting at any time during the year,
 provided the ambient air temperature is above 32°F and weather and ground
 conditions are suitable for planting. Provide container grown plants at dead
 end road installations.
 719.06.2 Pruning: If necessary, prune plant material on the project in
 accordance with the plan details.
 Limit pruning to the removal of injured twigs and branches or as directed.
 Leave the normal shape of the plant intact unless otherwise directed by the
 Department’s Landscape Architect. Selective pruning may be required on
 trees of special type or character at no direct pay.
 719.06.3 Soil Testing: Obtain the services of an established soil
 testing entity to coordinate soil sampling, perform testing and analyses, and
 prepare recommendations for materials and procedures to be used during the
 pre-planting phase. When practical, perform soil testing early enough to
 permit agricultural lime or other additives (if required) to be applied
 sufficiently in advance of planting so that the soil pH adjustment will occur
 before planting. Test and analyze samples to determine pH and fertility
 conditions. Use the test results and recommendations to determine the
 quantities of agricultural lime and fertilizer required for pre-planting
 440
 
 applications. Consider probable time of application when recommending
 agricultural lime. Furnish a copy of the test report with recommendations to
 the engineer. Testing will be at no direct pay.
 719.06.4
 Location of Plants: Locate plants in accordance with
 plans or as directed by the engineer or landscape architect.
 719.06.5
 Setting Individual Plants Not in Beds: Dig the
 planting-hole three times the width of the root ball of the plant. Make the
 sides of the planting-hole slope away from the center of the hole so as to
 resemble a shallow bowl. Loosen any smooth sides and hardpan to a depth
 as required below the bottom of the hole or to such depth that any moisture
 is allowed to move freely. Build a mound in the center of the plant hole with
 excavated material for the plant to sit on. Set plants plumb and at such level
 that, after settlement, a normal relationship of the root crown of the plant
 with the ground surface will be established. Plant trees so that the trunk flare
 is partially visible. Removing soil from the top of the root ball to find the
 trunk may be required. Place each plant in the center of the planting hole.
 When plants are set, tamp backfill soil under and around the base of each
 root mass to fill all voids. Plant in backfill soil complying with 719.03.2.
 Thoroughly settle backfill by watering and tamping to minimize settling and
 leaning of plant material. Stake plants 6 feet tall and greater in accordance
 with applicable nursery practices or as shown on any details provided.
 Locate all staking materials within the saucer. The cost of staking is included
 in the cost of the individual plants not in a bed. Maintain all plant material
 in a vertical position for the contract period. On balled and burlapped stock,
 prior to backfilling, cut and remove all wire or cord from the root balls and
 stems. Remove the burlap from the root ball and plant hole. On container
 grown stock, remove the container, scarify, and spread circling roots
 horizontally before backfilling. Backfill soil, mulch, and staking are
 included in the cost of individual plants not in beds. Notify the engineer in
 writing of any problems before installing the trees.
 After planting has been completed, form a saucer using excavated
 material around each plant as shown in the planting details. Extend saucers
 to the limits of the planting holes for trees and shrubs. No saucers are
 required in areas of bed preparation. Shrubs in lines or groups may share a
 common saucer around their perimeter.
 719.06.6
 Setting Individual Plants (Bed Preparation Mulch
 Beds): A mulch bed surrounds individual plants planted in a mass. A
 mulch bed does not contain bed preparation materials from Table 719-1. The
 bed shape shall be approved by the engineer. All grass and weeds shall be
 441
 
 removed mechanically or by chemical means and all debris shall be removed
 from the area. Soil shall be loosened and lumps broken to a minimum depth
 of 6 inches within the mulch bed area. After individual plantings have been
 completed, a saucer shall be formed using excavated material around each
 plant as shown in the planting details or they may share a common saucer
 around their perimeter. The area shall be treated with an approved preemergence herbicide in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations and a trench shall be created around the perimeter in an
 aesthetically pleasing form separating the grass and bed areas prior to placing
 mulch. The cost of the top dress mulch used in a mulch bed is paid under
 the top dressing mulch item.
 719.06.7 Fertilizer: Furnish and place either granular or tablet
 commercial fertilizer at the specified rate in accordance with this section and
 718.03.1. Mix fertilizer with backfill soil before backfilling. Equally place
 the recommended amount of fertilizer tablets in the upper 2 inches of backfill
 soil, 2 inches from the root ball, or in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations.
 Use fertilizer tablets in individual plant holes, separate from bed areas.
 After the tree or shrub has been placed, apply the manufacturer’s prescribed
 amount and spacing of tablets for the specified plant size.
 719.06.8
 Agricultural Lime: Furnish and place agricultural lime
 in accordance with Section 718 to adjust the soil pH.
 719.06.9
 Backfilling: Take care in placing backfill along the sides
 and over the root mass of plants. Place backfill to three-quarters the depth
 of the ball on the sides and water uniformly on the sides of the root mass to
 allow settlement of the plant. Straighten, raise, or replant plants that settle
 or lean before or after watering.
 Spread excavated material not used as backfill or for saucers on areas of
 the project as directed or dispose of in accordance with 202.02.
 719.06.10 Water: Furnish and apply water in sufficient quantities for
 proper irrigation of the plants at no direct pay.
 719.06.11 Bed Preparation: The bed shape shall be approved by
 the engineer. Remove grass, weeds, sticks, roots, stones, and other debris
 from the planting bed. Treat the planting bed with an approved preemergence herbicide in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Roto-till the planting bed to the specified depth and add
 the materials of Table 719-1. Mix water management gel and mycorrhizal
 inoculant into the top 4 inches of soil at the rate recommended by the
 manufacturer prior to planting or seeding. Spread the bed preparation
 442
 
 material over the bed area, then rake or roto-till into the soil to produce a
 uniformly mixed layer.

 Create a trench around the entire bed. Build all beds as “raised” beds.
 Rake beds smooth and remove dirt lumps, stones, sticks, grass, and other
 foreign matter. Finish grades of bed trenches next to walks or buildings shall
 be from 1 to 2 inches below finish grade of adjoining surfaces unless
 otherwise shown on the plans or as directed.
 719.06.12 Mulching: Place mulch uniformly to the specified depth
 on and within the planting saucers and bed areas, then water. Avoid placing
 mulch directly against the trunks of trees and the stems of shrubs. Do not
 mulch individual plants not in beds more than 3 inches deep.
 719.06.13 Weeding: Remove weeds from bed areas, the planting
 basin of each plant and groups of plants, and the saucer. Mow for a radial
 distance of 5 feet around individual plants not in beds. Cut the grass in the
 10-foot circle to a satisfactory height. Use selective herbicides when
 approved by the District Roadside Development Coordinator. Contact-type
 herbicides shall be compatible with plant material. Weed as directed to
 maintain a neat appearance throughout the period of establishment and
 replacement.
 719.07 PERIOD OF ESTABLISHMENT AND REPLACEMENT.

 and conforming to these specifications, this portion of the contract will be
 given provisional acceptance.
 443
 
 719.07.1 Period of Establishment: Care for planted and mulched
 areas for a period of establishment, which shall be one full growing season,
 after provisional acceptance is made. A full growing season shall begin
 April 16 and extend one full year until April 15 of the next year. Complete
 planting any time during the planting season specified in 719.06.1. If
 planting is completed prior to April 16, the growing season shall begin at
 provisional acceptance and extend to April 15 of the following year. Any
 extension of the planting season past April 15 shall result in an extension of
 the period of establishment to October 31 of the following year. During this
 period of establishment, preserve plants in a healthy, growing condition.
 Such plant establishment work shall include cultivation, weeding, watering,
 pruning, controlling insects, pests, disease, and other work determined
 necessary by the engineer to ensure healthy plant growth.
 Contact the engineer every week and outline activities which will be
 performed on the project. Failure to contact the engineer weekly and
 perform activities will result in a 1 percent reduction of the landscape
 contract amount, for each week of noncompliance before final payment.
 Weed in the vicinity of plants, place mulch, and water the plants as required.
 During the period of establishment, maintain a neat and clean appearance of
 planting areas.
 719.07.2 Replacement: Remove and replace plants that show signs
 of failure to grow at any time, or which are so injured or damaged as to render
 them unsuitable for the purpose intended, as determined by the engineer after
 consultation with the Department’s Landscape Architect. Unless otherwise
 directed by the engineer, replace unsuitable plants within 15 calendar days
 after the engineer marks or otherwise indicates that the plants shall be
 replaced. Failure to comply in the time allotted will result in having the costs
 of these replacement plants deducted from the contract amount upon final
 payment, but the contractor shall remain liable for the original contract
 specifications.
 When replacing plants, comply with the spacing and size requirements
 originally specified for the plants being replaced. Use the same species for
 replacement ground cover plants as originally specified for the ground cover
 being replaced. Other replacement plants shall be the same species as the
 plants being replaced unless the engineer, after consultation with the
 Department’s Landscape Architect, approves the substitution of alternative
 species of plants in accordance with the provisions in this subsection.
 Furnish and install replacement plants at no cost to the Department.
 
 444
 
 719.07.3 Semifinal Inspection: A semifinal inspection by the
 contractor and the engineer will be held two weeks prior to the end of the
 period of establishment to determine the acceptability of plants. Perform
 replacement planting, as required, in accordance with 719.06 and 719.07.2.
 Replace unsatisfactory plants in kind, quantity, and size with live, healthy
 plants installed as originally specified. Use substitute varieties of plants only
 when approved. Only these replacements made at this time will not require
 a period of establishment. All plants that must be replaced at the semifinal
 inspection will be replaced at the contractor’s expense.
 Upon completion of plant replacements and prior to final acceptance of
 the project, weed around plants and remove discarded materials, rubbish, and
 equipment from areas of the right-of-way affected by operations. Remove
 staking from trees unless otherwise directed by engineer.
 719.07.4 Final Acceptance: Final inspection of plant material will
 be held approximately two weeks after replacement planting has been
 completed. Final acceptance will be made if all plants are in place, alive,
 and in conformance with plans and specifications.
 Replace plants that are unsatisfactory at the time of final inspection of the
 project in kind, quantity, and size with live, healthy plants installed as
 originally specified. Use substitute varieties of plants only when approved.
 These replacement plantings shall be made at no cost to the Department.
 719.08 MEASUREMENT. Furnishing and planting the various types and
 sizes of plant materials will be measured per each. No measurement for
 payment will be made for plant hole preparation, backfill material, fertilizer
 tablets, water, staking, plant maintenance, or plant replacement of individual
 trees and shrubs either inside or outside of bed areas.
 Bed preparation and top dressing mulch will be measured by the square
 yard.

 728.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. In general, jack pipes
 30 inches diameter and greater and bore pipes less than 30 inches diameter.
 Begin the work at the outfall end of pipe when possible. When the grade at
 the jacking or boring end is below ground surface, excavate suitable pits or
 trenches for conducting operations and placing joints of pipe. Provide
 adequate sheeting and bracing to prevent earth caving.
 For pipe with bell joints, if the outside diameter of the pipe bell exceeds
 the outside diameter of the pipe barrel by more than 1 inch, either case the
 pipe or pressure grout its full length. Furnish and install an approved type
 and size casing, in accordance with these specifications. Pressure grout with

 Approval of this plan shall not relieve the contractor from responsibility for
 obtaining the desired result.
 728.03.1 Jacking: Provide heavy duty jacks suitable for forcing
 pipe through the embankment. Apply equal pressure to all jacks and transmit
 the pressure to the pipe end through a jacking head. Design the jacking head
 so that pressure is uniformly applied around the ring of the pipe. Provide a
 backstop or jacking frame to adequately resist pressure of the jacks under
 load. Set pipe on guides properly fastened together to support the pipe in the
 
 465
 
 proper direction at correct grade. Provide suitable cushioning material, such
 as plywood, between sections of concrete pipe.
 Excavate material ahead of the pipe and remove through the pipe. Do not
 extend excavation more than 24 inches beyond the forward end of pipe.
 When the character of embankment material dictates, reduce the excavation
 distance to prevent the embankment from being damaged. Dispose of
 excavated material in accordance with 202.02.
 When excavating on the underside of pipe, conform to the contour and
 grade of the pipe for at least one-third the circumference of pipe. Provide a
 clearance of not more than 2 inches for the upper half of pipe, tapered to zero
 at the point where excavation conforms to the contour of pipe.
 Construct a steel cutting edge around the forward end of pipe that will
 transmit pressures uniformly around the ring of the pipe.
 Continue jacking without interruption to prevent pipe from becoming
 firmly set in the embankment.
 Do not allow pipe to vary horizontally or vertically by more than 1/4 inch
 per 10 feet from established line and grade. Any variation shall be regular;
 no abrupt changes in direction will be permitted. Remove and replace any
 pipe damaged or misaligned in jacking operations at no direct pay.
 728.03.2 Boring:
 Bore mechanically, using a pilot hole
 approximately 2 inches in diameter. Extend the pilot hole through the
 embankment and check for line and grade before boring begins. Maintain
 the same line and grade variations as specified for jacking. Use the pilot hole
 as the centerline of the larger diameter hole to be bored.
 Use water and other fluids with boring operations only to lubricate
 cuttings. Jetting will not be permitted.
 In unconsolidated soil formations, a gel-forming colloidal drilling fluid
 consisting of at least 10 percent high-grade bentonite may be used to
 consolidate cuttings of the bit, seal walls, and provide support of the hole,
 and furnish lubrication for subsequent removal of cuttings and installation of
 pipe.
 Remedy overcutting in excess of 1 inch by pressure grouting the entire
 length of the installation.
 Join pipe in accordance with Section 701.
 728.04 MEASUREMENT. Quantities of jacked or bored pipe for

 Raised Pavement Markers
 731.01 DESCRIPTION. Furnish and place raised pavement markers in
 accordance with the plans.
 The contractor shall be responsible for field layout and alignment of
 raised pavement markers. Existing pavement striping shall generally be used
 as a guide in determining raised marker locations. The Department will
 replace obliterated striping prior to installation of raised pavement markers;
 however, if no striping exists or is obliterated at the time of raised marker
 installation, the contractor shall determine raised pavement marker locations
 in accordance with plan details or as directed.
 731.02 MATERIALS.
 731.02.1 Markers: Markers shall comply with 1015.09. Use the
 same product throughout the project. Markers shall be the specified class,
 type, color, size, and shape.
 731.02.2 Epoxy Adhesive: Use Type I (Rapid Setting) or Type II
 (Standard Setting) epoxy resin adhesive system complying with 1017.03.
 Mix epoxy components and dispense adhesive in accordance with
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 731.02.3 Bituminous Adhesive: Bituminous adhesive shall
 comply with 1015.09.3.2.
 731.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 731.03.1 Weather Limitations: Do not apply markers when there is
 moisture on the surface.
 731.03.1.1 Epoxy Adhesive: When using a standard set adhesive,
 do not apply markers at ambient air temperatures less than 50°F. When using
 a rapid set adhesive, application of markers will be permitted at ambient air
 temperatures between 35°F and 50°F, provided the adhesive is adequately
 heated to obtain proper viscosity for mixing and application, and is also
 identified as a rapid set type on container labels and Certificates of Delivery.
 731.03.1.2 Bituminous Adhesive: Apply markers when the
 ambient air temperature reaches 35°F or greater, or in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 731.03.2 Removal of Markers: Remove markers by methods that
 will not damage the pavement surface. Repair damage to pavement surface
 at no cost to the Department. After removing the markers, the debris and
 479
 
 residue shall become the property of the contractor and be disposed of
 properly.
 731.03.3 Cleaning of Surfaces:
 Surfaces, including ramps and gore areas, on which markers are to be
 applied must be cleaned of all materials that may reduce the bond of
 adhesive. Clean surfaces by blast cleaning or other approved methods which
 do not damage the surface. Blast cleaning equipment must have positive
 cutoff controls. Maintain surfaces in a clean dry condition until placement of
 markers.
 731.03.4 Application of Markers: Place markers with bituminous
 adhesive on asphalt surfaces.
 Place markers with Type I or II epoxy resin adhesive, or Type II or III
 bituminous adhesive on portland cement concrete surfaces.
 Surfaces on which markers are to be placed shall be blown dry
 immediately prior to marker placement. Apply markers to surfaces with
 adhesive in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Do not place pavement markers on joints.
 731.03.4.1 Epoxy Adhesive: Mixed adhesive shall have a
 uniformly grey color with no streaks of either black or white on the surface
 or within mixed adhesive. Voids in a cured undisturbed sample
 approximately 1/16 inch thick from the extrusion nozzle shall not exceed
 4 percent by volume. Machine mixer and applicator shall be capable of
 accurately and uniformly proportioning the two components in a 1:1 ratio
 within 5 percent by volume of each component (i.e., within 47.5 to
 52.5 percent for each component). Perform periodic checks of proportioning
 equipment to determine the actual ratio of components. Do this by placing
 containers in front of the mixing chamber and measuring the actual volume
 of each component. Arrange equipment so it is possible to bypass the mixer
 to perform these periodic checks. Maintain temperature of adhesive between
 70°F and 110°F before mixing. Apply adhesive in sufficient quantity to
 cause excess adhesive to be forced out around the perimeter of the marker.
 Maintain the temperature to prevent excessive flow of epoxy from the
 marker when installed. Fill voids in markers with an open grid pattern on
 bottom with adhesive immediately prior to placement.
 731.03.4.2 Bituminous Adhesive: Heat and melt the adhesive in
 either thermostatically controlled double boiler type units utilizing heat
 transfer oil or thermostatically controlled electric heating pots. The
 melter/applicator unit shall be suited for both melting and pumping
 application through heated applicator hoses. Heat the adhesive as per
 manufacturer’s recommendations and apply directly to the pavement surface
 480
 
 from the melter/applicator by either pumping or pouring. The area of the
 bituminous adhesive bed shall be a minimum of 6 inches in diameter. Apply
 markers to the adhesive within 10 seconds. Place the marker in the adhesive
 bed by applying downward pressure until the marker is firmly seated.
 Immediately remove adhesive on exposed surfaces of markers with soft rags
 moistened with mineral spirits or kerosene. Protect markers against impact
 until the adhesive hardens. Reheat and reuse the adhesive; however, do not
 exceed the pot life at application temperatures.
 731.04 MEASUREMENT. Raised pavement marker installation will be
 measured per each marker furnished, placed, and accepted.
 Raised pavement marker removal will be measured per linear mile.
 731.05 PAYMENT. Payment for field layout and alignment of raised
 pavement markers will be in accordance with Section 740. Payment for
 installation of raised pavement markers will be made at the contract unit
 prices per each. Payment for removal of raised pavement markers will be
 made at the contract unit price per linear mile. Payment will include all labor,
 materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to complete the work.

 thermoplastic markings shall be in accordance with 1015.13.
 732.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 732.03.1 Equipment for Standard (Flat) Thermoplastic
 Marking Material: Finished markings shall be continuous and uniform in
 shape, with clear and sharp dimensions. Applicators shall be capable of
 producing various widths of traffic markings. Applicators shall produce
 sharply defined lines and provide means for cleanly cutting off stripe ends
 and applying broken lines.
 For new 90 mil application, equipment shall consist of an extrusion die
 or a ribbon gun that simultaneously deposits and shapes lines at a thickness
 of 90 mils or greater on the pavement surface.
 482
 
 When restriping 90 mils thickness onto existing thermoplastic markings,
 only a ribbon gun shall be used.
 For 40 mils, only a spray application will be allowed.
 732.03.2 Weather Limitations: Do not apply markings within 12
 hours after rain, if moisture is present, or when the surface temperature or
 ambient temperature is below 50°F.
 732.03.3 Cleaning of Surfaces: Clean surfaces, including ramps
 and gore areas, on which markings are to be applied of materials that may
 reduce adhesion of the thermoplastic marking materials to the pavement.
 Clean by blast cleaning or other approved methods, which do not damage
 the surface. Blast cleaning equipment must have positive cutoff controls.
 Keep surfaces clean and dry until placement of markings.
 732.03.4 Removal of Existing Markings:
 732.03.4.1 40 Mil Thickness: Remove existing thermoplastic
 markings that are flaking or peeling prior to placement of thermoplastic.
 Remove flaking or peeling material by mechanical sweeper or wire brush to
 the satisfaction of the engineer prior to thermoplastic application. After
 markings are removed, properly dispose of striping debris and residue.
 732.03.4.2 90 Mil Thickness: Before placement of 90 mil or
 greater thermoplastic on portland cement concrete, remove existing
 thermoplastic markings regardless of condition. Apply a two part sealer
 before placement of any temporary paint or permanent thermoplastic.
 Asphalt sections do not require removal of thermoplastic unless otherwise
 noted on the plans. After markings are removed, properly dispose of striping
 debris and residue.
 732.03.4.3 Intersection Markings, Legends and Symbols:
 Remove existing markings from the pavement surface. Apply 125 mils of
 new thermoplastic markings.
 732.03.4.4 Preformed Plastic Markings (Tape): Remove
 existing markings to the pavement surface before applying the preformed
 plastic markings (tape).
 Remove markings by methods that will not damage the pavement or
 bridge deck. After removing the markings, pick up and dispose of the debris
 and residue within 24 hours. Removal shall be to such extent that 75 percent
 of the pavement surface or bridge deck under the markings is exposed. At
 the end of each day’s operations, the engineer may direct that temporary
 pavement markings complying with Section 713 be used in areas where
 existing markings have been removed and new markings not placed.
 483
 
 Satisfactorily remove temporary pavement markings prior to resuming
 thermoplastic marking operations.
 Remove all markings made in error or not conforming to the traffic
 operation in use to the satisfaction of the engineer. Do not obliterate
 markings by painting with asphalt binder or other material.
 732.03.5 Application of Surface Primer: When applying 90 mil
 thermoplastic, use a two component primer sealer prior to placement of
 thermoplastic materials on portland cement concrete surfaces and oxidized
 asphalt unless otherwise directed by the engineer.
 When applying 40 mil thermoplastic, use a single component surface
 primer on portland cement concrete surfaces unless otherwise directed by
 the engineer.
 When applying preformed thermoplastic, use primer as recommended by
 the manufacturer. Do not allow traffic over primed areas before applying
 thermoplastic.
 732.03.6 Application of Markings: Install material in specified
 widths from 4 inches to 24 inches. Finished lines shall have well defined
 edges and be free of waviness. Measurements will be taken as an average
 through any 36-inch section of line. Offset longitudinal lines approximately
 2 inches from longitudinal joints. A tolerance of + 1/2 inch and -1/8 inch
 from the specified width will be allowed, provided the variation is gradual.
 Lines should be squared off at each end without excessive mist or drip.
 Transverse variations from the control device up to 1 inch will be allowed
 provided the variation does not increase or decrease at the rate of more than
 1/2 inch in 25 feet. Remove lines not meeting these tolerances and replace
 at no cost to the Department.
 732.03.6.1 Thermoplastic Markings: For extruded or ribbon
 gun applied markings, the thickness of material, not including drop-on beads,
 shall not be less than 90 mils for lane lines, edge lines, black contrast, gore
 markings, and no less than 125 mils for crosswalks, stop lines, words, and
 symbol markings.
 For spray applications the thickness of material, not including drop-on
 beads, shall not be less than 40 mils.
 Apply glass beads to the molten surface of completed stripes by either a
 single drop or a double drop application depending on the thickness of the
 thermoplastic striping. Glass beads shall be uniformly distributed to ensure
 that the full width of the line is visible at night. For a 40 mil single drop
 application, the contractor has discretion on which beads to use in order to
 meet the retroreflectivity requirements. For the first drop of a 90 mil double
 drop application, use Type 4 beads at a minimum rate of 211 pounds per mile
 484
 
 based on a 4-inch solid line. The type of bead for the second drop is at the
 contractor’s discretion; however, a smaller bead is typical. Black
 thermoplastic pavement markings require skid-resistant filler in lieu of glass
 beads.
 732.03.6.2 Preformed Plastic Markings: Apply preformed
 plastic markings in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 732.03.7 Field Testing of Roadway Markings: The contractor
 and the Department will field test the pavement markings in accordance with
 1015.10, 1015.11, and Table 732-1. Failure to meet these requirements will
 require the contractor to replace the portion of the material shown to be out
 of specification as directed by the engineer.
 Take initial readings within 30 days of application. Initial readings taken
 after 30 days must meet the same requirements as initial readings. Any late
 readings submitted after the 30 days will be considered initial readings. Take
 the initial retroreflectivity readings with a DOTD inspector present. Upon
 completion of testing, the DOTD inspector will immediately take possession
 of a copy of the retroreflectivity readings in either a hard copy (81/2 inches x
 11 inches) or electronic format on a USB drive, as noted below.
 Additionally, provide documentation to the Department that the instrument
 has been calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements,
 including the required annual factory calibration.
 The Department reserves the right to inspect the striping and take
 additional readings six months to one year after the date of installation for
 the one year warranty.
 For each material type, take a different set of readings in accordance with
 Table 732-1. Provide the data to the Department electronically in Microsoft
 Excel® (xls) format downloaded from the reflectometer data. Each
 spreadsheet shall have a header that states all of the following:
 1. Project number;
 2. Date material installed;
 3. Type of material installed;
 4. Interstate: Specify the route and direction and show the beginning
 mile-point to ending mile-point, of material installed; and,
 5. State Route: Specify the route and direction. Also specify X number
 mile from intersection to X number mile from intersection, of material
 installed. (Ex. Route US 61 South; 0.10 Mile South of Old Hammond

 Rubblizing Portland Cement Concrete
 Pavement
 734.01 DESCRIPTION. Rubblize existing reinforced or non-reinforced
 portland cement concrete pavement using a pavement-fracturing machine
 capable of delivering sufficient energy to rubblize the pavement full-depth
 in a manner that fractures the concrete slab into smaller pieces that eliminates
 slab action without damaging the subgrade. Thoroughly compact and seat
 the rubblized pavement with appropriate equipment as outlined in this
 specification. Either the resonant frequency breaker (Method 1) or the
 multihead breaker (Method 2) process may be utilized to rubblize and seat
 the pavement. Use only one of the methods (Method 1 or Method 2) on the
 project.
 When using Method 2 on concrete pavements with thickness greater
 than 11 inches, the contractor may use a guillotine-breaking device with the
 engineer’s approval, if pre-fracturing of the pavement is necessary to achieve
 rubblization size requirements without damage to the subgrade.
 Perform the work in accordance with the lines, grades, and typical
 sections shown on the plans and as outlined in this specification.
 734.02 EQUIPMENT.
 734.02.1 Method 1 (Resonant Frequency Breaker Process):
 734.02.1.1 Resonant Frequency Breaker Machine: Use a
 self-contained, self-propelled, resonant frequency breaker for rubblizing
 existing pavement that is capable of producing 2000 pound force blows at a
 rate of not less than 44 cycles per second with an amplitude of less than 1
 inch.

 Equipment:
 734.02.1.2.1 Steel-Wheel Vibratory Roller: Use a steelwheel vibratory roller having a gross weight of not less than 10 tons,
 operated in the vibrating mode, to compact the rubblized pavement.
 734.02.1.2.2 Pneumatic-Tired Roller: Use a pneumatic-tired
 roller as specified in 503.16.3 to compact the rubblized pavement.
 734.02.2 Method 2 (Multihead Breaker Process):
 734.02.2.1 Multihead Breaker Machine: Use a multihead
 breaker that is a rubber-tired, self-propelled unit, which uses 12 to 16
 hammers with weights ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 pounds mounted
 490
 
 laterally in pairs with half the hammers in a forward row and the remainder
 diagonally offset in a rear row so that there is continuous breakage from side
 to side. Each hammer shall have one continuous strike bar whose width
 varies from 1 to 2 inches. Each pair of hammers is attached to a hydraulic
 lift cylinder, which operates as an independent unit, and cycles at a rate of
 30 to 35 impacts per minute. It shall be capable of rubblizing up to 13 feet in
 width of pavement in one pass.
 734.02.2.2 Multihead Breaker Seating Equipment:
 734.02.2.2.1 Z-Grid Roller:
 Use a modified vibratory steel-wheel roller with a "Z" grid pattern on
 the drum face. The roller shall have a gross weight of at least 10 tons, and
 operate in the vibratory mode, to settle and seat the rubblized pavement.
 734.02.2.2.2 Steel-Wheel Vibratory Roller: Use a steelwheel vibratory roller having a gross weight of not less than 10 tons,
 operated in the vibrating mode, to compact the rubblized pavement.
 734.02.2.2.3 Pneumatic-Tired Roller: Use a pneumatic-tired
 roller as specified in 503.16.3 to compact the rubblized pavement.
 734.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 734.03.1 Preparation Prior to Rubblization:
 734.03.1.1 Drainage System Installation: Prior to rubblization
 operations, install drainage systems as shown on the plans. Ensure that
 drainage systems are properly functioning for a minimum of two weeks prior
 to rubblization.
 734.03.1.2 Removal of Existing Asphalt Surfaces: Remove
 existing asphalt concrete overlays and patches from the PCC pavement
 surfaces prior to rubblization. Existing full-depth asphalt patches shall
 remain in place, unless directed for removal and replacement by the
 engineer.
 734.03.1.3 Saw-Cut Joints: Make new full-depth saw-cuts along
 existing joints on all pavement edges where rubblized PCC is adjacent to
 pavement that will remain in place. Sever all load transfer devices between
 the planned rubblization and PCC pavement remaining in place.
 734.03.1.4 Shouldering: Complete shoulder adjustments and/or
 any pavement widening up to the elevation of the existing pavement grade
 prior to beginning the rubblization operations. These areas can be used to
 support the rubblization machines while the existing PCC pavement is being
 rubblized.
 
 491
 
 734.03.2 Test Strip and Test Pit to Establish Procedure:
 734.03.2.1 Test Strip: Before the rubblization process begins, the
 engineer will designate a test section of at least 150 feet by 12 feet. Rubblize
 the test section using varying degrees of energy and/or various striking
 heights until a procedure is established that will rubblize the pavement as
 outlined herein.
 On projects that have a transition to a bridge or to an overpass, make the
 test pit in the transition where the material will be totally removed.
 734.03.2.2 Test Pit: In the middle of the test strip, excavate a 4foot square test pit at a location selected by the engineer, to determine that
 the breaker is producing rubblized pieces of the specified sizes as outlined
 in these specifications. Check the rubblized particle sizes throughout the
 entire depth of the pavement. Remove the test pit material from the project
 and fill the hole using coarse aggregate material as specified in 1003.03.
 Place and properly compact the replacement material to the satisfaction of
 the engineer.
 The engineer and the contractor shall mutually agree upon the
 rubblization procedure based on the performance criteria contained herein.
 Use the established procedure to rubblize the remainder of the pavement.
 Continuously monitor the rubblization operation, and make minor
 adjustments in the striking pattern, striking energy, number of passes, and
 other factors necessary to continually achieve acceptable rubblization
 throughout the project. Inform the engineer of any major adjustments that
 may be required in the process to provide rubblized pavement that conforms
 to the specification requirements. Additional test pits may be required by the
 engineer to confirm that the PCC pavement is adequately rubblized.
 734.03.3 Rubblization Criteria:
 734.03.3.1 Method 1 (Resonant Frequency Breaker):
 Compact the complete width of the rubblized pavement surface with the
 vibratory steel-wheel roller and pneumatic-tired roller in the following
 sequence as a minimum. The engineer will determine if more passes are
 necessary.
 1. One pass with the vibratory steel-wheel roller in vibratory mode.
 2. One pass with the pneumatic-tired roller.
 3. Two passes with the vibratory steel-wheel roller in vibratory mode.
 A pass shall be defined as forward and backward in the same path.
 Operate the roller at a speed not to exceed 4.5 feet per second.
 Break the existing concrete pavement into pieces ranging from sand size
 to 6 inches, with no more than approximately 10 percent of the material
 larger than 6 inches and no individual pieces larger than 8 inches in any
 492
 
 dimension. The majority of rubblized concrete material shall be pieces
 ranging from1 to 3 inches in size in any dimension.
 734.03.3.2 Method 2 (Multihead Breaker): Compact the
 complete width of the rubblized pavement surface with the vibratory Z-grid
 roller, vibratory steel-wheel roller, and pneumatic-tired roller in the
 following sequence as a minimum. The engineer will determine if more
 passes are necessary.
 1. Four passes with the Z-grid roller in vibratory mode (minimum).
 2. Four passes with the vibratory steel-wheel roller in vibratory mode.
 3. Two passes with the pneumatic-tired roller.
 4. Two passes with the vibratory steel-wheel roller in vibratory mode
 immediately prior to asphaltic concrete overlay,
 A pass shall be defined as forward and backward in the same path.
 Operate the roller at a two speed not to exceed 4.5 feet per second.
 Break the existing concrete pavement into particles with at least 75
 percent (as determined by visual observation) of the particles being less than
 3 inches and no pieces larger than 6 inches in any dimension within the
 upper half of the slab thickness. The bottom half of the slab shall have
 rubblized pavement with no pieces larger than 9 inches in any dimension.
 734.03.4 Reinforced Portland Cement Concrete Pavement:
 Debond the reinforcing steel from the concrete and leave in place. If any
 steel is protruding from the surface, cut the steel below the surface and
 remove.
 734.03.5 General Rubblization Procedures: Rubblize in partial
 widths when necessary to maintain traffic as shown in the contract
 documents. When the rubblization process is adjacent to in-service
 pavement, take measures to prevent debris from entering the in-service
 pavement. In areas where the pavement is to be overlayed prior to
 completion of the rubblization, extend the initial rubblization a minimum of
 6 inches beyond the width of the pavement to be overlayed. For the resonant
 frequency breaker process, begin rubblizing at a free edge or previously
 broken edge and progress toward the opposite shoulder or longitudinal
 centerline of the pavement. Continuous coverage of the entire pavement
 surface, overlapped if necessary to achieve adequate rubblization with the
 breaking shoe, will be required.
 Additional passes of either rubblization device may be required to meet
 the particle sizes outlined in this specification as directed by the engineer.
 734.03.6 Dust Control: Minimize the dispersion of dust from the
 rubblization operation until the rubblized surface is overlayed with asphalt
 concrete. Provide a water truck, operator, and all water necessary for dust493
 
 control purposes. Do not apply excessive water to the rubblized surface. Dust
 control is incidental to the rubblization process and will not be paid for
 separately. Dust-mitigation measures must be acceptable to the engineer.
 734.03.7 Damage to Base, Underlying Structures, and Other
 Facilities: Operate the rubblization machine and rollers in a manner that
 will avoid damaging the base, underlying structures, utilities, drainage
 facilities, bridge approach slabs, bridge decks, and other facilities on the
 project. If any damage occurs, immediately cease operations, notify the
 engineer, and repair the damage as directed. Make repairs in a timely manner
 at the contractor’s expense.
 734.03.8 Unstable Area Patching: If unstable areas occur because
 of expansion of the existing concrete pavement, remove the unstable areas
 to a maximum length of 4 feet by 12 feet in width and replace with full-depth
 asphalt concrete patching in accordance with Section 510 as directed.
 Patching procedures shall conform to the standard specifications, and shall
 be completed prior to placing the asphalt concrete overlay.
 Patch areas of poor subgrade support that are identified during the
 rubblization and seating process as directed. Remove the rubblized
 pavement, base course, and subgrade material from unstable areas. Replace
 the material with full depth asphalt concrete patches in accordance with
 Section 510 as directed.
 734.03.9 Progress of the Work: Unless otherwise specified, no more
 than 48 hours shall elapse between rubblizing the pavement and the
 placement of the asphalt concrete overlay. A minimum of 4 inches of asphalt
 concrete is required before traffic is allowed on the on the rubblized
 pavement. If rain occurs between these operations, this time limitation may
 be waived to allow sufficient time for the rubblized pavement to dry to the
 satisfaction of the engineer.
 Except at restricted crossover and ramp crossings, do not allow traffic
 on the rubblized pavement before the initial asphalt concrete base and
 leveling courses, if required, are in place. Immediately remove rubblized
 material dislodged by construction traffic from the roadway in front of the
 paver.
 734.04 MEASUREMENT.
 Rubblizing portland cement concrete
 pavement will be measured by the square yard. The width will be the
 nominal width of the existing pavement, and the length will be measured
 along the centerline of each roadway or ramp.

 Painted Traffic Striping
 737.01 DESCRIPTION. Furnish and apply reflective white or yellow
 paint for pavement striping in accordance with plan details, the MUTCD,
 and these specifications.
 737.02 MATERIALS. Traffic paint shall be waterborne and comply with
 1015.12. Glass beads for drop-on application shall comply with 1015.13.
 737.03 EQUIPMENT. Selection of proper equipment to produce
 satisfactory results shall be the responsibility of the contractor.
 737.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Pavement striping shall
 be 4 inches in width on all routes. Striping widths for gore markings and
 turning lanes shall be 8 inches unless noted otherwise on the plans. All lines
 shall have clean edges.
 Paint for curbs and islands may be applied by machine or hand methods
 as accepted by the engineer. Apply all striping on pavement prior to opening
 to traffic, except when rain or other unavoidable occurrences prevent
 marking the pavement, in which case mark the pavement as soon as
 conditions permit. The requirements of 713.07 shall govern over the above
 mentioned application requirements.
 737.04.1 Surface Preparation: Clean surfaces, including ramps and
 gore areas, to be striped of materials that may reduce adhesion of paint to
 pavement. Remove all flaking or peeling material to the satisfaction of the
 engineer by blast cleaning or other approved methods, which do not damage
 the surface. Blast cleaning equipment must have positive cutoff controls.
 Keep surfaces clean and dry at the time of paint application.
 737.04.2 Weather Limitations: Do not paint striping when pavement
 surface is wet or damp, when air is foggy or misty, when air or surface
 temperature is below 50°F, or when wind or other conditions create a dust
 film on the clean pavement surface before striping can be applied or causes
 displacement of striping material.
 737.04.3 Application: Use the longitudinal joint or existing centerline
 stripe to determine the location of the centerline of new striping. In the
 
 517
 
 absence of a longitudinal joint or existing stripe, locate the centerline of new
 striping with the acceptance of the engineer.
 737.04.4 Application Rate: Apply paint at a thickness of
 22 wet mils to produce a line of 15 dry mils. Apply temporary paint at a
 thickness of 15 wet mils. Glass beads shall be uniformly distributed to
 ensure that the full width of the line is visible at night.
 737.04.5 Tolerances: Construct broken lines with a stripe-to-gap
 ratio of a 10-foot paint stripe to a 30-foot gap. The length of the stripe shall
 be 10 feet minimum and 101/2 feet maximum. The stripe-gap cycle shall be
 40 feet minimum and 40 ½ feet maximum.
 A tolerance of +1/2 inch and -1/8 inch from the specified painted line
 width will be allowed, provided the variation is gradual. Segments of broken
 line may vary ± 6 inches from the specified length provided it is not
 consistently short. Square off painted line segments at each end without mist
 or drip. Longitudinal painted lines shall not deviate from established
 alignment by more than 1 inch. The rate of deviation shall not increase or
 decrease more than 1/2 inch in 25 feet. Remove lines not meeting these
 tolerances by abrasive blasting or grinding and replace at no cost to the
 Department. The Project Engineer may waive the tolerance when deviations
 are caused by undulation in the pavement surface.
 737.04.6 Protection of Markings: Do not allow traffic to cross
 over a wet stripe. Use flaggers or other methods to prevent traffic from
 crossing the wet stripe or adjust the operation. Repair stripes that have been
 marred or picked up by traffic before they have dried; clean the pavement
 outside the stripe at no cost to the Department. The contractor shall be
 responsible for resolving all issues related to paint on private vehicles at no
 cost to the Department.
 737.04.7 Field Testing of Painted Traffic Striping: Field-test the
 pavement markings in accordance with 1015.12 and Table 737-1. Replace
 the portion of the material shown to be out of specifications as directed by
 the engineer.
 Take initial readings within 30 days of application. Any late readings
 submitted after the 30 days will be considered initial readings. Take the
 initial retroreflectivity readings with a DOTD inspector present during
 testing. Upon completion of the testing, the DOTD inspector will
 immediately take possession of a copy of the retroreflectivity readings in
 either a hard copy, 81/2 inch x 11 inch, or electronic format on a USB drive
 and as noted below. Additionally, provide documentation to the Department
 that the instrument has been calibrated in accordance with the
 518
 
 manufacturer’s requirements, including the required annual factory
 calibration.
 For each material type, take a different set of readings in accordance with
 Table 737-1. Provide the data to the Department electronically in Microsoft
 Excel® (xls) format downloaded from the reflectometer data. Each
 spreadsheet shall have a header that states all of the following:
 1. Project number;
 2. Date material installed;
 3. Type of material installed;

 Construction Layout
 740.01 DESCRIPTION. This section sets forth requirements for all
 construction layouts. Establish lines and grades, take all cross-sections, and
 stake out the construction work in accordance with these specifications, plan
 details, and as directed. Construction layout also includes, but is not limited
 to, the layout of pavement striping and raised pavement markers, setting of
 line and grade for construction of superelevated curves or other applicable
 work items, and assisting in the coordination of utility relocation activities
 to ensure that the placement of relocated facilities will not conflict with
 required construction.
 740.02 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Establish all lines and
 grades and stake out all project work, including sufficient vertical and
 horizontal control points for utility relocations for use by the Department and
 others.
 The project survey control and horizontal alignment are based on the
 Louisiana State Plane Coordinate System. The construction plans and/or
 right-of-way map depicts the coordinates and datum of sufficient survey
 control points to establish or re-establish horizontal control throughout the
 length of the project. Employ such methods as approved by the project
 engineer for the location of the project alignment and other necessary survey
 control points in accordance with currently acceptable surveying standards
 and practices. When required, the Department will also provide one bench
 mark on or near the project for vertical control. Verify the values of any
 intermediate bench marks shown on the plans, by checking against the bench
 mark established by the Department for vertical control.
 Employ qualified engineering and surveying personnel experienced in
 layout and construction of highways and bridges to correctly establish and
 keep complete and comprehensive records (field books or approved
 electronic files) of all lines and grades necessary from initial layout to final
 acceptance. Provide sufficient qualified staff, of at least one employee, on
 site during utility relocation periods. Provide any necessary survey work to
 ensure there are no utility conflicts with required construction. Provide daily
 documentation of utility relocation activities for incorporation into the
 project diaries.
 The contractor shall be liable for the accuracy of the initial layout and all
 subsequent alignment and elevations and shall, at no additional pay, rebuild,
 526
 
 repair or make good any portion of the work found to be incorrectly
 positioned either horizontally or vertically at any time before final
 acceptance. Notify the engineer immediately of any apparent errors in the
 plans. Compute and provide template grades to the engineer. In order to
 obtain pipe order lengths, provide the appropriate grades to the engineer two
 weeks in advance of the work.
 Numbered notebooks for recording of all lines and grades will be
 provided by the Department and shall be properly indexed and cross
 referenced by the contractor before return to the engineer for submittal with
 the final estimate. Computer generated printouts will be allowed when
 approved.
 Set stationing for overlay projects using an approved measuring device
 that is accurate to 0.1 percent. Place stakes every 100 linear feet and
 maintain throughout construction.
 For pavement preservation type projects, the contractor will be
 responsible for recording the location of all existing pavement markings and
 laying out the required final markings subject to the approval of the Project
 Engineer.
 Perform the layout of striping, raised pavement markers, and signs by
 methods approved by the engineer prior to placement.
 740.03 MEASUREMENT.
 Measurements for determination of pay quantities will be made by the
 Department. Construction layout and utility oversight and coordination will
 be measured per lump sum, which will include all labor, materials, tools,
 equipment, and incidentals required to complete the work.
 No changes in the lump sum contract price will be made for minor
 additions or deletions to the scope of work.
 740.04 PAYMENT.
 Payment for construction layout, and utility oversight and coordination
 will be made at the contract lump sum price in accordance with Table 740-1

 not required.
 Place geotextile fabric between natural ground and reinforced backfill.
 Remove all loose or extraneous material and sharp objects from subgrade that
 may damage the geotextile fabric during installation. Stretch, align, and place
 geotextile fabric in a wrinkle-free manner in contact with the soil. Overlap
 adjacent geotextile fabric edges a minimum of 18 inches.
 Repair or replace torn or punctured sections of the geotextile fabric as
 directed by the project engineer. When repairing geotextile fabric, place a
 section of fabric that is large enough to cover the damaged area with an
 overlap of at least 18 inches on all sides.
 
 553
 
 6. Wall Erection
 Place facing elements so that their final position is vertical or battered as
 shown on the plans. Erect facing elements with a staggered horizontal joint
 pattern. Place facing elements in successive horizontal lifts in the sequence as
 directed by the Project Engineer as backfill placement proceeds. Construct
 MSEW structure using a predetermined backward batter corresponding to the
 anticipated outward wall deflection as determined by the MSEW system
 supplier. Adjust batter in the field as directed by the Project Engineer during
 construction.
 If the wall is to interface with another wall that will be constructed after this
 contract, submit wall interface and embankment compaction details at these
 locations to the Project Engineer.
 As necessary during backfill placement, maintain panels in a vertical
 position with temporary wooden wedges placed in the joint at the junction of
 the two adjacent panels on the external side of the wall. Utilize external
 bracing for the initial lift as required.
 Conform to the following tolerances for panel walls:
 1.
 Horizontal and vertical alignment of wall face ± 3/4 inch along
 any 10-foot distance.
 2.
 Overall Vertical tolerance (plumb) of wall is not to exceed 1/2
 inch per 10 feet of wall height from the final wall batter.
 Negative (outward batter) batter is not acceptable.
 3.
 Maximum allowable out of plan offset at any panel joint ≤ 1/4
 inch.
 Conform to the following tolerances for modular block walls:
 1.
 Horizontal and vertical alignment of wall face ± 3/4 inch along
 any 10-foot distance.
 2.
 Overall Vertical tolerance (plumb) of wall is not to exceed 1 inch
 per 10 feet of wall height from the final wall batter. Negative
 (outward batter) batter is not acceptable.
 3.
 Maximum horizontal gap between erected blocks < 1/4 inch.
 4.
 Shim or grind to control the elevations of any two adjacent blocks
 within 1/16 inch.
 7. Reinforced Backfill Placement
 Place backfill immediately after the erection of each lift of facing elements.
 Level backfill material to an elevation approximately 1 inch above facing
 connection before placing each level of soil reinforcement. Avoid damage or
 disturbance of wall materials when placing backfill. Remove and replace
 damaged wall materials at no expense to the Department. Assure no voids
 554
 
 exist directly beneath the reinforcing elements during backfill placement near
 the facing. Compact backfill to 95 percent of its maximum dry density in
 accordance with Section 203 and DOTD TR 401. Determine optimum
 moisture content and maximum dry density in accordance with DOTD TR 415
 or TR 418. Perform compaction control testing at minimum frequency of one
 test per every 2 feet of wall height for every 100 lineal feet of wall. Assure a
 uniform moisture distribution prior to and during compaction of each layer.
 Place backfill materials at a moisture content less than or equal to the optimum
 moisture content. Remove and rework backfill material having a moisture
 content in excess of the optimum until the moisture content is uniformly
 acceptable throughout the entire lift. Place backfill in 8-inch loose lifts closely
 following the MSEW facing erection. Decrease lift thickness as necessary to
 obtain the specified density. Compact backfill without disturbing or distorting
 the reinforcement. Maintain a minimum of 6 inches of compacted backfill
 between construction equipment and soil reinforcement or geotextile fabric.
 Use light mechanical tampers adjacent to the backside of the wall facing,
 within a 3-foot wide area, to achieved compaction. Do not use Sheep’s foot or
 grid-type rollers for compacting backfill within the reinforced soil zone. Shape
 the last level of backfill to permit runoff of rainwater away from the wall face
 at the end of each day’s operations. Do not allow surface runoff from adjacent
 areas to enter the reinforced soil zone until it is protected from infiltration.
 Repair any damage or movement caused by erosion, sloughing, or saturation of
 the reinforced backfill or retained backfill repaired at no expense to the
 Department.
 8. Soil Reinforcement Placement
 Install soil reinforcement in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations and these specifications. Place reinforcement within the
 layers of the compacted backfill material at locations shown on the plans. To
 prevent damage, place only the amount of soil reinforcement required for
 immediately pending work. Place reinforcement with the strongest direction
 perpendicular to the wall face, unless shown otherwise in the plans. Connect
 reinforcement to MSEW facing in accordance with the MSEW system
 supplier’s recommendations. Place reinforcement flat and apply uniform
 tension to remove any slack in the connection or reinforcement material.
 9. Surcharge
 When the plans indicate that an earth surcharge be placed over the
 reinforced zone, retain the surcharge with a temporary wall. Construct
 temporary wall with MSEW or other approved method, as accepted by the
 Project Engineer, at no direct cost to the Department. Place temporary wall
 555
 
 within one foot of permanent wall face. Slope the top surface of the surcharge
 to allow surface water to drain away from wall. Place a plastic membrane over
 reinforced zone prior to placing surcharge material. Include materials,
 placement, removal of the temporary wall, and surcharged materials in the cost
 of the permanent wall unless indicated otherwise on the plans.
 10. Abutment Piling
 Adhere to the following requirements and sequence if abutments supported
 on piling are to be placed in the reinforced zone.
 1.
 Drive all piles within the reinforced zone prior to MSEW
 installation.
 2.
 Encase each pile in a Smooth Wall Corrugated Galvanized Steel
 (SWCGS) pipe of sufficient thickness in accordance with AASHTO M 36 to
 prevent buckling or distortion during placement and compaction of wall
 backfill. Include this expense in the cost of the wall.
 3.
 Place spacers between the pile and SWCGS pipe to prevent the
 pipe from coming in contact with the pile during backfilling of the wall.
 4.
 Extend SWCGS pipe from bottom of backfill to bottom of bridge
 abutment cap.
 5.
 After positioning, seal the top of the SWCGS pipe to prevent
 debris accumulation during placement of backfill, and keep pipe sealed until
 filled with granular material.
 6.
 Fill SWCGS pipe loosely with granular material after completion
 of wall construction as directed and accepted by the Project Engineer.
 11. MSEW Structural Excavation and Backfill
 Excavate and backfill below the original ground line to facilitate the
 placement of the reinforced backfill for the MSEW. Furnish and subsequently
 remove any temporary retaining systems and dewatering systems necessary for
 execution of the work, and dispose of all excavated materials below the
 original ground elevation to the final grading line in accordance with plan
 details and these specifications.

 803.05 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 803.05.1 Drilled Shaft Excavation: Drilling equipment shall have
 adequate capacity, including power, torque, and down thrust, to excavate the
 maximum plan diameter to a depth of 20-foot or 20 percent beyond the
 maximum plan shaft depth, whichever is greater. Excavate to the required
 depth shown on the plans or as directed by the engineer. Conduct excavation
 in a continuous operation until completing shaft excavation, except for pauses
 and stops as noted, using accepted equipment capable of excavating through
 the type of material expected. Provide temporary casing at the site in sufficient
 quantities to meet the needs of the anticipated construction method.
 Interruptions for casing splicing and removal of obstructions will be
 considered as pauses and will be allowed. Other interruptions will be
 568
 
 considered stops. In all instances, protect the excavation against sidewall
 instability.
 If using slurry to protect shaft excavation, maintain the minimum level of
 slurry throughout interruptions in shaft excavation operations. Recondition the
 slurry to the required properties prior to recommencing shaft excavation
 operations.
 Sidewall over-reaming is required when the time for shaft excavation
 exceeds 36 hours. Shaft excavation time is measured from the beginning of
 excavation, or excavation below the casing when casing is used, to the start of
 concrete placement.
 Sidewall over-reaming is required when the engineer determines the
 excavation has softened due to the excavation methods, swelled due to delays
 in the start of concrete placement, or degraded because of slurry cake buildup.
 Sidewall over-reaming and extending the excavation is required if slurry is
 in contact with the bottom 5 feet of the excavation for more than 12 hours.
 Extend the excavation until undisturbed material is reached.
 Over-reaming diameter shall be a minimum of 1 inch and a maximum of
 6 inches greater than plan diameter. Over-reaming may be accomplished with
 a grooving tool, over-reaming bucket, or other equipment accepted by the
 engineer.
 The contractor shall bear all costs associated with sidewall over- reaming,
 over-drilling, and related additional drilled shaft concrete. Construct drilled
 shafts after placement of embankment fill unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 Drilled shafts installed prior to completion of embankment fill shall not be
 capped until the fill has been placed to the bottom of cap elevation.
 803.05.2 Drilled Shaft Excavation Protection Methods: Protect
 excavation from wall caving and bottom heave. Prevent soil adjacent to the
 drilled shaft from being disturbed throughout the full length of the shaft.
 Disturbed soil is defined as soil which its geotechnical properties have been
 changed from those of the original in-situ soil.
 Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the engineer that stable conditions are
 being maintained. If the engineer determines that stable conditions are not
 being maintained, immediately take action to stabilize the shaft. Submit a
 revised Drilled Shaft Installation Plan which addresses the problem and
 prevents future instability. Do not continue with drilled shaft construction
 until the damage which has already occurred has been repaired and the
 engineer’s acceptance of the revised Drilled Shaft Installation Plan has been
 received.
 Protect excavation with one or more of the following methods.
 569
 
 803.05.2.1 Temporary Casing: If casing is adequately sealed into
 competent soils such that water cannot enter the excavation, excavation may
 proceed in soils below the water table provided the water level within the
 casing does not rise or exhibit flow. As the temporary casing is withdrawn, a
 sufficient head of fluid concrete must be maintained to ensure that water or
 slurry outside the temporary casing will not breach the column of freshly
 placed concrete.
 Casing extraction shall be at a slow, uniform rate with the pull in line with
 the shaft axis. Movement of casing shall not deform reinforcing steel cage.
 The reinforcing steel cage shall meet the tolerances as specified in 803.05.10.
 Remove all temporary casing from the excavation as completing concrete
 placement, unless permission has been received from the engineer to leave
 specified temporary casing in place.
 Drilled shaft casing installed by rotating or oscillating methods shall be
 equipped with cutting teeth or a cutting shoe. Use of rotating or oscillating
 casing methods shall be in accordance with the equipment and procedures
 shown in the accepted Drilled Shaft Installation Plan.
 803.05.2.2 Permanent Casing: Drive casing to the specified tip
 elevation and excavate. Vibratory hammer is not allowed. If tip elevation
 cannot be reached, excavate and advance casing until reaching the specified tip
 elevation. After the casing has been filled with concrete, fill all void space
 between the casing and drilled shaft excavation with a granular material
 meeting the requirements of 1003.09.
 Remove upper portion of permanent casing to the top elevation of the
 drilled shaft or as specified. For drilled shafts constructed within a permanent
 body of water, remove upper portion of permanent casing to the low water
 elevation, unless otherwise specified.
 803.05.2.3 Slurry: Maintain stability during drilled shaft excavation
 and concrete placement operations. Maintain equalized water pressure on the
 sides and base of the drilled shaft excavation when encountering or
 anticipating groundwater based on the available subsurface data. If water
 exists in amounts greater than 3-inches in depth or enters at a rate of more than
 12-inches per hour then the drilled shaft excavation must be filled with slurry
 to at least the level specified in 803.05.2.3.2 and concrete placed by tremie.
 803.05.2.3.1 Slurry Technical Assistance: The
 manufacturer’s representative shall provide technical assistance and be
 present at the site prior to polymer slurry use. The manufacturer’s
 representative shall remain at the site during the construction and
 
 570
 
 completion of a minimum of one drilled shaft to adjust the slurry mix to the
 specific site conditions.
 After the manufacturer’s representative is no longer present at the site, the
 contractor’s employee trained in the use of the slurry shall be present at the site
 throughout the remainder of shaft slurry operations for this project to perform
 the duties specified above.
 803.05.2.3.2 Minimum Level of Slurry in the Excavation:
 Maintain slurry level in the excavation to obtain hydrostatic equilibrium at a
 height required to provide and maintain a stable hole, but no less than 5 feet
 above the water table or surface of surrounding water body.
 Maintain slurry level sufficiently above all unstable zones to prevent
 bottom heave, caving or sloughing of those zones. Provide casing or other
 means as necessary to meet these requirements.
 803.05.2.3.3 Cleaning Slurry: Clean, re-circulate, de-sand, or
 replace the slurry, as needed, in order to maintain the required slurry
 properties. Sand content will only be required to be within specified limits
 immediately prior to concrete placement. Slurry properties outside the
 specified ranges may result in risks such as unstable holes or lost tools.
 803.05.2.3.4 Slurry Sampling, Testing, and Logging:
 Mineral slurry and polymer slurry shall be mixed and thoroughly hydrated in
 slurry tanks, lined ponds, or storage areas. Draw sample sets from the slurry
 storage facility and test the samples for conformance with the appropriate
 specified material properties before beginning slurry placement in the drilled
 hole. A sample set shall be composed of samples taken at mid-height and
 within two feet of the bottom of the storage area.
 Sample and test all slurry in the presence of the engineer. The date, time,
 names of the persons sampling and testing the slurry, and the results of the
 tests shall be recorded. Submit a copy of the slurry log to the engineer at the
 completion of each drilled shaft or when requested during the drilling
 operation.
 Take sample sets of all slurry, composed of samples taken at mid-height
 and within two feet of the bottom of the drilled shaft, and test during drilling as
 necessary to verify control of slurry properties. As a minimum, take sample
 sets of slurry and test at least once every four hours after beginning use during
 each shaft construction.
 Take and test sample sets of all slurry immediately prior to placing
 concrete.
 803.05.3 Obstructions: When obstructions are encountered, notify the
 engineer promptly. An obstruction is defined as a specific object encountered
 571
 
 during the drilled shaft excavation operation which prevents or hinders the
 advance of the drilled shaft excavation. Obstructions include, but are not
 limited to: logs, man-made objects, and rocks. When efforts to excavate the
 obstruction result in a significant reduction in the rate of advance, remove or
 break up the obstruction. If blasting is required, submit a Blasting Plan to the
 Chief Construction Engineer for review and acceptance. Equipment lost in the
 excavation will not be considered an obstruction as defined above and shall be
 promptly removed. Equipment removal and repair of excavation will be at no
 additional cost or time to the Department.
 803.05.4 Protection of Existing Structures: Control operations to
 prevent damage to existing structures, utilities, roadways, and other facilities.
 Preventive measures may include selecting construction methods and
 procedures that will prevent excessive caving of the drilled shaft excavation,
 monitoring and controlling vibrations from driving of casing, sheeting, or
 drilling of the shaft.
 803.05.5 Drilled Shaft Excavation Inspection: Use appropriate
 means, such as a cleanout bucket, air lift, or hydraulic pump to clean the
 bottom of the excavation of all drilled shafts. Limit sediment at excavation
 base to a maximum of 1.5 inches, with a minimum of 50 percent of the shaft
 base less than 0.5 inch of sediment just prior to concrete placement.
 The drilled shaft excavation will be inspected for acceptance by the
 engineer prior to proceeding with construction. The bottom of the excavated
 drilled shaft shall be sounded with an airlift pipe, a tape with a heavy weight
 attached to the end of the tape, a borehole camera with visual sediment depth
 measurement gauge, or other means acceptable to the engineer to determine
 that the drilled shaft bottom meets contract requirements.
 803.05.6 Assembly and Placement of Reinforcing Steel: Prior to
 and during fabrication of the steel reinforcing cage, support reinforcing bars
 off the ground surface and protect from contamination of mud and other
 deleterious materials. Rigidly brace reinforcing cage to retain its configuration
 during handling and construction. Individual or loose bars will not be
 permitted. All intersections of vertical and horizontal bars must be tied. Show
 bracing and any extra reinforcing steel required for fabrication of the cage on
 details submitted with the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan.
 Carefully position reinforcement; securely fasten to provide minimum
 clearances and ensure that no displacement of the reinforcing steel cage occurs
 during placement of the concrete. The reinforcing steel cage shall meet the
 tolerances as specified in 803.05.10.
 
 572
 
 Splicing of the reinforcement cage during placement in the shaft excavation
 will not be permitted unless shown on the plans or allowed by the engineer. If
 the reinforcing cage is spliced during placement into the drilled shaft
 excavation, the splice details and location of the splices shall be in accordance
 with the plans and the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan.
 Securely hold steel reinforcing cage in position throughout the concrete
 placement operation. Tie and support the reinforcing steel in the drilled shaft
 so that the location of the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable
 tolerance. Use concrete spacers or other acceptable non-corrosive spacing
 devices at sufficient intervals [near the bottom, the top, and at intervals not
 exceeding 10 feet vertically] to ensure concentric spacing for the entire cage
 length. The number of spacers required at each level will be one spacer for
 each foot of excavation diameter, with a minimum of four spacers at each
 level. The spacers shall be of adequate dimension to ensure an annular space
 between the outside of the reinforcing cage and the side of the excavation
 along the entire length of the drilled shaft as shown on the plans. The width of
 the spacer shall be a minimum of 1.75 inches. Acceptable feet (bottom
 supports) made of plastic or concrete shall be provided to ensure that the
 bottom of the cage is maintained at the proper distance above the base of the
 excavation unless the cage is suspended from a fixed base during concrete
 placement.
 Bracing steel which constricts the interior of the reinforcing cage must be
 removed after lifting the cage if free fall concrete or tremie methods of
 concrete placement are to be used.
 803.05.7 Assembly and Placement of Access Tubes: Install
 access tubes meeting the requirements of 803.02.6 for the full depth of all
 shafts to permit access of CSL testing equipment, except as otherwise noted
 herein. If, in the opinion of the engineer, the condition of the drilled shaft
 excavation permits drilled shaft construction in the dry, the engineer may
 specify that CSL testing be omitted.
 Clear access tubes of all debris before installing. Repair or replace
 damaged access tubes prior to concrete placement.
 The minimum number of access tubes installed shall be as specified in
 Table 803-5.

 Fit the tubes with a watertight threaded or welded end cap on the bottom
 and a removable threaded cap on the top. Use watertight threaded or welded
 splices. Place the access tubes around the drilled shaft, inside the spiral or
 hoop reinforcement, and 3-inches clear of the vertical reinforcement, at a
 uniform spacing measured along the circle passing through the centers of the
 access tubes. If these minimums cannot be met due to close spacing of the
 vertical reinforcement, then bundle the access tubes with the vertical
 reinforcement.
 The engineer may allow the tubes to be installed on the outside of the cage
 if the access tubes have a minimum concrete cover of 3 inches and bumpers are
 installed on the outside of the cage to prevent tubes from being crushed. Install
 the tubes in a symmetric pattern with tubes equally spaced around the
 perimeter of the cage and parallel to the plan axis of the shaft. Fasten the tubes
 to the reinforcement cage at a maximum of 5-foot intervals or as directed by
 the engineer. Threaded U-bolts may be used to attach tubes to the rebar cage.
 Extend the tubes to the shaft bottom and at least 3-foot above the shaft top. If
 the shaft top is subsurface, extend the tubes at least 3-foot above the ground
 and water surfaces. Do not damage the tubes during reinforcement installation
 operations. Avoid pulling or displacing the cage after concrete has begun to
 set. Within two hours of concrete placement, fill the access tubes with clean
 water and cap or seal the tube tops to keep out debris. Water shall remain in
 the access tubes at all times until all CSL testing for that shaft is complete.
 Remove caps or plugs from tubes after concrete placement so as not to apply
 excess torque, hammering, or other stresses which could break the bond
 between the access tubes and the concrete. The contractor shall be responsible
 574
 
 for all delays arising from data quality issues due to improper installation or
 treatment of the CSL access tubes.
 803.05.8 Concrete Placement, Curing, and Protection:
 Commence concrete placement as soon as possible after completion of drilled
 shaft excavation and inspection by the engineer. Immediately prior to
 commencing concrete placement, the drilled shaft excavation and the
 properties of the slurry (if used) shall conform to 803.02. Continue concrete
 placement in one operation to the top of the drilled shaft.
 Unless approved otherwise by the engineer, the elapsed time from
 beginning to completion of concrete placement in the drilled shaft shall not
 exceed two hours for drilled shafts 5-foot in diameter or less. The minimum
 concrete placement rate for drilled shafts larger than 5-foot in diameter shall be
 30 cubic yards per hour.
 The engineer may allow an extension of the concrete placement time if the
 contractor adequately demonstrates by trial mix and slump loss tests that the
 slump of the concrete will be 4 inches or greater during the entire time of
 concrete placement during the longer placement time.
 If water is not present (a dry shaft), the concrete shall be deposited through
 the center of the reinforcement cage by a method which prevents segregation
 of aggregates. If concrete is placed by free fall method, minimum clear
 opening shall be 24 inches in diameter and use a centering device such that the
 free-fall is vertical down the center of the drilled shaft without hitting the sides,
 the steel reinforcing bars, or the steel reinforcing bar cage bracing. Reduce the
 rate of concrete placement or reduce the height of free fall as directed by the
 engineer if the concrete strikes the reinforcing cage or sidewall.
 The elapsed time for concrete placement shall not exceed the time limit
 defined in the accepted Drilled Shaft Installation Plan and demonstrated by a
 successful technique shaft or test shaft. The concrete placement time shall
 commence at the mixing of the concrete and extend through the completion of
 placement of the concrete in the drilled shaft excavation, including removal of
 any temporary casing. For wet placement methods, the placement time shall
 start at the batching of the initial load of concrete to be placed in the shaft.
 Prior to concrete placement, provide test results of both a trial mix and a slump
 loss test conducted by an accepted testing laboratory using accepted methods
 to demonstrate that the concrete meets this defined placement time limit. The
 concrete mix shall exhibit slump values and limitations conforming
 to 803.02.1. The trial mix and slump loss tests shall be conducted at ambient
 temperatures appropriate for site conditions. Ambient temperature at the time
 
 575
 
 of concrete placement will not be greater than the ambient temperature at the
 time of the concrete trial mix and slump loss test.
 Admixtures such as midrange water reducers, plasticizers, and retarders
 may be used and shall conform to 1011.02 and be included in the concrete mix
 design and detailed in the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan. After accepting for
 use, adjust all admixtures for the conditions encountered on the job so the
 concrete remains in a workable plastic state throughout the defined placement
 time limit.
 Throughout concrete placement operations, the discharge end of the tremie
 shall remain submerged in the concrete at least 5 foot and the tremie shall
 always contain enough concrete to prevent water from entering. The concrete
 placement shall be continuous until work completion, resulting in a seamless,
 uniform shaft. If the concrete placement operation is interrupted, the engineer
 may require core drilling or other tests to verify that the drilled shaft contains
 no voids or horizontal joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, repair them or
 replace the drilled shaft at no expense to the Department.
 Before placing fresh concrete against concrete deposited in water or slurry
 (construction joint), remove all scum, laitance, loose gravel, and sediment on
 the surface of the previously placed concrete.
 Complete a concrete yield plot for each wet shaft poured by tremie
 methods. Submit this yield plot to the engineer in accordance with 803.03.4.
 Casing installations or drilled shaft excavations are not to be performed within
 a clear distance of three diameters of a newly poured shaft within 24 hours of
 concrete placement and only after the concrete has reached a minimum
 compressive strength of 1800 psi.
 803.05.9 Tremies: A gravity tremie shall have a hopper at the top that
 empties into a watertight tube at least 10 inches in diameter. If using a
 concrete pump in lieu of the tremie, use a watertight rigid pump line with a
 minimum diameter of 5 inches and all requirements specified herein apply.
 Mark tremie clearly at one foot increments. The discharge end of the
 tremie tube shall include a device to seal out water while the tube is first filled
 with concrete. In lieu of a seal at the discharge end of the pipe, a “plug” or
 “pig” may be placed in the hopper prior to concrete placement which moves
 through the tremie when pushed by the concrete, forcing water or slurry from
 the tremie pipe. A plug or pig is a flexible device which fills the entire cross
 section of the tremie tube and creates an impermeable separation between the
 concrete in the tremie and the slurry. When placing a plug or pig at the top of
 the tremie it shall be inserted after the tremie is placed in the wet excavation
 and before charging the tremie with concrete. The bottom of the tremie shall
 576
 
 be placed slightly off the bottom of the excavation to allow the plug or pig to
 pass out of the tremie.
 The hopper and tubes shall not contain aluminum parts that will have
 contact with the concrete. The inside and outside surfaces of the tubes shall be
 clean and smooth to allow both flow of concrete and the unimpeded
 withdrawal of the tube during concrete placement.
 803.05.10 Drilled Shaft Construction Tolerances: Construct shaft
 excavations so that the top center of the poured shaft with respect to the plan
 location is within the horizontal tolerances shown in Table 803-6.

 Drilled shafts in soil shall be within 1.5 percent of plumb. Plumbness will
 be measured from the top of poured shaft elevation or mudline, whichever is
 lower.
 During excavation of the shaft, make frequent checks on the plumbness,
 alignment, and dimensions of the shaft. Correct any deviation exceeding the
 allowable tolerances with a procedure accepted by the engineer.
 Check elevation of the top of the steel cage before and after placing
 concrete. If the upward displacement of the reinforcing cage exceeds 2 inches,
 or if the downward displacement exceeds 6 inches, the drilled shaft will be
 considered defective. Make corrections to the satisfaction of the engineer. No
 additional drilled shafts shall be constructed until the contractor has modified
 the reinforcing cage support in a manner satisfactory to the engineer.
 When the shaft reinforcing cage for a single column is to be tied directly to
 the column steel, the reinforcing cage shall be concentric with the drilled shaft
 excavation within a horizontal tolerance of 0.5 inch. On all other shafts, the
 reinforcing cage shall be concentric with the drilled shaft excavation within a
 horizontal tolerance of 1.5 inches.
 The top elevation of the completed drilled shaft shall have a tolerance of
 plus or minus 2 inches.
 577
 
 Tolerances for casings shall be in accordance with American Pipe Institute
 tolerances applicable to regular steel pipe.
 Drilled shaft excavations and completed shafts not constructed within the
 required tolerances will be considered defective. Correct all defective shafts to
 the satisfaction of the engineer. Materials and work necessary, including
 engineering analysis and redesign, to complete corrections for out-of-tolerance
 shafts shall be furnished without either cost or time to the Department.
 Redesign drawings and computations shall be sealed and signed by a registered
 Professional Engineer licensed in Louisiana.
 803.05.11 Integrity Testing:
 803.05.11.1 Crosshole Sonic Log Testing: Use Crosshole Sonic
 Log (CSL) testing to aid in identifying anomalies in shaft concrete by
 measuring ultrasonic pulse travel time from a signal source in one access tube
 to a receiver in another access tube. CSL testing will be used to determine
 integrity acceptance of the shaft.
 803.05.11.1.1 Testing Schedule: Perform testing after shaft
 concrete has cured at least 48 hours. Additional curing time prior to testing
 may be required if the shaft concrete contains admixtures, such as set retarding
 admixture or water reducing admixture. The additional curing time prior to
 testing required under these circumstances shall not be grounds for additional
 compensation or extension of contract time. No subsequent construction shall
 be performed on the completed shaft until shaft acceptance by the engineer.
 Complete CSL tests for technique shafts and test shafts within five calendar
 days of concrete placement.
 Complete CSL tests for production shafts within 20 calendar days of
 concrete placement.
 During the development of the CSL testing schedule, consider the CSL
 testing time constraints and the shaft production schedule.
 803.05.11.1.2 Testing Equipment: The CSL test equipment
 shall be capable of performing the following functions and conform to
 ASTM D6760:
 • Displaying individual CSL records, recording CSL data, and analyzing
 receiver responses.
 • Printing of CSL logs.
 • Testing in 1.5 inch minimum I.D. access tubes.
 • Generating an ultrasonic voltage pulse to excite the source with a
 synchronized triggering system to start the recording system.
 • Measuring and recording the depths of CSL probes at the time signals
 are recorded.
 578
 
 • Filtering/amplifying signals.
 803.05.11.1.3 Testing Procedures: Use the submitted and
 accepted testing consultant to perform CSL testing. Provide testing consultant
 with the shaft construction logs. Use CSL testing on all production shafts,
 technique shafts, and test shafts when any of the following conditions occur:
 placing shaft concrete through slurry; using full-length casing; or, as required
 by the engineer.
 Prior to performing CSL testing operations, remove concrete at the top of
 the drilled shaft down to sound concrete.
 Inspect access tubes after placing shaft concrete and before beginning the
 CSL testing. Each access tube that the test probe cannot pass through shall be
 replaced at no additional cost to the Department with a 2-inch diameter hole
 cored through the concrete for the entire length of the shaft. Unless directed
 otherwise by the engineer, cored holes shall be located approximately 6-inches
 inside the drilled shaft reinforcement and shall not damage the reinforcement.
 Descriptions of inclusions and voids in cored holes shall be logged and a copy
 of the log shall be submitted to the engineer. Findings from cored holes shall
 be preserved, identified as to location, and made available for inspection by the
 engineer.
 As a minimum, test all perimeter tube pairs and major diagonal tube pairs.
 If a possible defect is found, conduct CSL testing between additional pairs of
 tubes as determined by the testing consultant. No welding shall take place in
 the general vicinity during CSL testing operations.
 Perform CSL tests with the source and receiver probes in the same
 horizontal plane unless test results indicate potential defects in which case the
 questionable zone may be further evaluated with angled tests consisting of the
 source and receiver vertically offset in the access tubes. Make CSL
 measurements at 2-inch depth intervals. Starting from the bottom of the tubes,
 pull the probes simultaneously over a depth measuring device.
 803.05.11.2 Non-destructive Testing: Non-destructive testing,
 other than CSL, shall be performed in accordance with the plans and
 specifications.
 803.05.11.3 Reporting Results: Submit Integrity Test results to
 the engineer for preliminary review and comment within seven calendar days
 after the Integrity Test.
 The final Integrity Test results shall be sealed, signed, and dated by a
 Professional Engineer licensed in Louisiana prior to inclusion in the Integrity
 Test Report. Submit the final Integrity Test Report in accordance
 
 579
 
 with 803.03.5 to the engineer within 21 calendar days after completion of
 Integrity Test.
 803.05.11.3.1 CSL Test Results: Test results shall contain at
 least the following:
 • Project name and number;
 • Shaft identification number and location;

 • All additional pertinent information.
 803.05.12 Load Test: Install test shafts to the same dimensions, details,
 and elevations shown on the plans; install using the same equipment and
 installation procedures proposed for installation of the production drilled
 shafts.
 If the equipment or procedures change following the completion of load
 testing, install additional test shafts and conduct additional load tests as
 directed by the engineer at no additional cost to the Department.
 All load testing shall be completed and the results evaluated by the engineer
 before installing any production drilled shafts.
 803.05.12.1 Test Shaft: Test shafts are shafts constructed in
 advance of permanent shafts for purposes of determining shaft length by load
 testing. Test shafts shall be long enough to be drilled, if necessary, to 15 foot
 below the plan tip elevation of the nearest permanent shaft. Test shaft length
 shall be long enough to allow for all testing to be performed.
 803.05.12.2 Static Load Test: Static load tests shall be performed
 in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D1143, Procedure A:
 Quick Test, with the following exceptions:
 Apply the load in 20 equal increments or as directed. Hold each load
 increment for a period of five minutes. Load test shaft to failure or until
 reaching the specified maximum test load shown on the plans. The test shaft
 will be considered to have failed when continuous jacking is required and
 continuous shaft movement is measured. Unless otherwise directed, maintain
 load until the gross settlement has reached 5 percent of the maximum shaft
 diameter. After the plunging load and failure deformation have been achieved,
 allow the loading system to equalize until shaft movement and variations in
 jack pressure have ceased.
 Remove load in decrements of approximately 20 percent of the maximum
 load placed on the test shaft. Record gross settlement and load readings five
 minutes after reaching each unloading load decrement. Record the final
 recovery of the unloaded test shaft until movement is essentially complete for a
 period up to 30 minutes.
 803.05.12.2.1 Hydraulic Jack: Calibrate the entire hydraulic
 system for all stages of loading and unloading through an accepted
 581
 
 independent calibration service. Furnish a certified laboratory report of the
 calibration tests to the engineer. Perform calibration no more than 30 days
 prior to load test commencement. After the system is calibrated, no
 replacement parts will be permitted (except the pump) without recalibration of
 the system.
 803.05.12.2.2 Displacement Instrumentation:
 Furnish
 instrumentation to monitor the gross displacement readings at the shaft head
 during load testing. The instrumentation shall consist of three independent dial
 or electronic readout gauges capable of measuring displacement to a precision
 of ±0.001 inch, with a minimum travel range of 4 inches or 15 percent of
 maximum shaft diameter, whichever is greater. Provide smooth bearing
 surfaces perpendicular to the direction of the gauge stem travel for each gauge.
 803.05.12.3 High-Strain Dynamic and Force Pulse (Rapid)
 Load Tests: High-Strain Dynamic tests shall be performed in accordance
 with the procedures specified in ASTM D4945. The High-Strain Dynamic
 load test is imposed by the impact of a falling mass which typically has a
 weight of 1 to 2 percent of the maximum test load.
 Force Pulse (Rapid) tests shall be performed in accordance with the
 procedures specified in ASTM D7383. Two alternative procedures are
 provided: Procedure A uses a combustion gas pressure apparatus to produce
 the required axial compressive force pulse. Procedure B uses a cushioned drop
 mass apparatus to produce the required axial compressive force pulse. Either
 procedure will be acceptable.
 803.05.12.3.1 Preparation: Notify the engineering consultant of
 the requirement for a load test at least 30 days in advance of each test. Perform
 site and shaft preparation without damaging the instrumentation or cables. Cut
 and/or clean the surface of the shaft down to design or test elevation. The top
 of the shaft shall be smooth and level.
 803.05.12.3.2 Procedure: Perform load testing on cast-in-place
 shafts no sooner than seven days after completion, or once the shaft has
 achieved the design concrete compressive strength as determined by cylinder
 compression tests. Complete load test by applying one or more loading cycles
 to mobilize shaft ultimate resistance or until a load equal to or in excess of the
 required nominal resistance is reached.
 803.05.12.4 Bi-Directional Load Cell Test: Install load cells and
 load test instrumentation in accordance with the bi-directional load cell
 supplier recommendations, instructions, and procedure manuals, as accepted
 by the engineer.
 The bi-directional load cells shall be capable of expanding to not less than
 582
 
 6 inches while maintaining the applied test load.
 Coordinate with the load cell supplier to determine and/or verify all
 required equipment, materials, quantities, procedures, and all other applicable
 items necessary to complete the load testing shown on the plans.
 Furnish an acceptable pressurized gas source, a hydraulic pump, hydraulic
 lines, calibrated hydraulic gauge, and all other equipment and material
 necessary for performing the load tests. Furnish fresh potable water from an
 accepted source to form the hydraulic fluid used to pressurize the bi-directional
 load cells.
 Furnish, install, and monitor vibrating wire strain gauges as shown on the
 plans. Place the strain gauges in pairs on opposite sides of the reinforcing cage
 at the elevations shown on the plans.
 Attach two Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) vibrating
 wire displacement gauges to each load cell to monitor the expansion and
 contraction of the load cell. In addition, mount two LVDT gauges on an
 independent reference beam and set on opposite sides of the top of the test
 shaft to monitor axial shaft displacement.
 Set two telltale rods on the top of each load cell to monitor the displacement
 of the top of the load cell. The telltale shall consist of a 0.375-inch diameter
 stainless steel rod, greased for reducing friction and corrosion, and placed
 inside a constant 0.75-inch inside diameter pipe. Individual sections of
 telltales shall be joint coupled flush so that each rod is of uniform diameter
 throughout its length.
 Furnish a portable computer and electronic logging equipment to
 simultaneously monitor all instrumentation at time intervals designated by the
 engineer.
 Assemble the load cells, piping, and other attachments and make ready for
 installation in accordance with the requirements of the bi- directional load cell
 supplier and the following:
 Weld steel top and bottom bearing plates to the load cells. Provide holes
 through the bearing plates, as appropriate, to facilitate placement of tremie
 concrete;
 Coat the upper surface of the bottom steel bearing plate with grease prior to
 installation into the shaft, to prevent concrete bonding with the bottom plate;
 Attach the load cells and plate assembly to the reinforcement cage.
 Securely fasten all hydraulic hoses, telltale casing, slip joints, etc. to the
 reinforcing cage. Prior to installation into the drilled shaft excavation, protect
 the top of piping to keep dirt, concrete or other deleterious materials from
 entering the piping; and,
 583
 
 Limit deflection of the cage to a maximum of 2 feet between pick points
 while lifting the cage from the horizontal position to vertical. Provide
 additional support, bracing, strong backs, etc. to maintain deflection within the
 specified limit.
 For each load test, place the load in increments of 5 percent of the estimated
 maximum test load shown on the plans, or until the nominal resistance load, as
 indicated by the instruments, is approached, or to the maximum capacity of the
 load cell, whichever occurs first. Unless the maximum capacity of the load
 cell has been reached, apply increments of 2.5 percent of the estimated
 maximum test load until the limiting load is attained, or the drilled shaft top
 displacement reaches 2 inches, or to the maximum extension of the load cell;
 When the load cell will be used for a subsequent loading stage, the engineer
 may interrupt the loading sequence at a load cell opening of approximately
 3 inches, or less. Maintain each load increment for a minimum period of five
 minutes, with complete sets of readings obtained and recorded from all gauges
 and instruments at one, two, and five minutes after application of the load
 increment. Apply each increment of load within the minimum length of time
 practical and take instrument system readings immediately. It is intended that
 the addition of a load increment and the completion of the instrument system
 readings shall be completed within 5 to 15 minutes. The engineer may elect to
 hold the maximum applied load for up to one hour. The load shall be removed
 in decrements of about 10 percent of the maximum test load. Remove each
 decrement of load within the minimum length of time practical and take
 instrument system readings immediately. It is intended that the removal of a
 load decrement and the completion of the instrument system readings shall be
 completed within 5 to 15 minutes. The engineer may also require a reloading
 cycle of ten loading increments and five unloading decrements. Record final
 recovery of the drilled shaft for a period up to one hour after the last unload
 interval.
 After completion of the load test to the satisfaction of the engineer, and
 when authorized in writing by the engineer, flush all hydraulic fluid from the

 803.05.13 Loading Permanent Shaft: When loading a permanent
 shaft, conduct the loading in accordance with the procedure given
 in 803.05.12, except the test load shall be as directed by the engineer.
 803.05.14 Technique Shaft: Demonstrate the adequacy of methods,
 techniques, and equipment by successfully constructing a technique shaft in
 accordance with the requirements. Position the technique shaft at location
 shown on the plans, but no less than a clear distance of three drilled shaft
 diameters from the closest production shaft. Construct the technique shaft to
 the maximum diameter and maximum depth of any production drilled shaft
 shown on the plans. Reinforce the technique shaft with the same
 reinforcement as the corresponding size production shaft. Complete the
 technique shaft and obtain acceptance by the engineer prior to initiating
 installation of the load test shafts and production drilled shafts. Failure to
 demonstrate to the engineer the adequacy of methods and equipment shall be
 reason for the engineer to require alterations in equipment and/or method to
 eliminate unsatisfactory results. Any additional technique shaft requiring
 demonstration of the adequacy of altered methods or construction equipment
 will be at no additional cost to the Department. Once acceptance has been
 586
 
 given by the engineer to construct production drilled shafts, no changes will be
 permitted in the methods or equipment used to construct the satisfactory
 technique shaft without the written acceptance of the engineer, which may
 require additional technique shafts or load tests.
 The technique shaft will be used by the engineer to determine if the
 contractor can: control dimensions and alignment of excavations within
 tolerance; install casing and remove temporary casing; seal the casing into
 impervious materials; control the size of the excavation under caving
 conditions by the use of a mineral, polymer slurry, or by other means; properly
 clean the completed drilled shaft excavation; construct drilled shafts in open
 water areas; handle and install reinforcing cages; satisfactorily place concrete
 meeting the specifications within the prescribed time limit; and sSatisfactorily
 execute any other necessary construction operation.
 Cut off technique shaft as directed by the engineer, but no less than 2 foot
 below finished grade and leave in place after receiving written authorization
 from the engineer. For navigable waterways comply with 107.09. For other
 waterways, remove shaft to 2 foot below mudline or as directed.
 803.05.15 Evaluation and Shaft Acceptance: Drilled shaft
 construction may continue prior to acceptance of the previous shaft if, in the
 opinion of the engineer, the contractor is constructing the shafts in accordance
 with the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan and the construction methods are
 satisfactory.
 The engineer will evaluate the Integrity Test Reports and determine
 whether the drilled shaft construction method produces acceptable shafts.
 Allow five working days for the evaluation to be conducted after receipt of an
 acceptable Integrity Test report. Integrity testing should indicate the presence
 of irregularities such as poor quality concrete, voids, honeycombs, and soil
 intrusions. Report all defects indicated by the testing to the engineer and
 conduct further tests as required to evaluate the extent of such defects.
 Conduct additional CSL measurements between all tube pair combinations in
 any drilled shafts that have velocity reductions greater than 20 percent.
 Provide CSL data and 3-D tomography analysis of all CSL data in the event
 velocity reductions greater than 20 percent are detected. Additional
 nondestructive testing to determine extent of defects or to determine if tube
 debonding has occurred shall be at no cost to the Department. If the engineer
 determines that the drilled shaft is acceptable based on favorable testing
 results, the shaft is acceptable.
 
 587
 
 After completing integrity testing and the engineer has issues, written
 acceptance of the shaft, dewater and grout the access tubes. Foundation
 construction involving the shaft may continue.
 803.05.16 Defective Shaft and Remediation: If the engineer
 determines that the shaft lacks integrity due to unacceptable anomalies in the
 concrete or failure to carry load, the shaft will be rejected. Suspend production
 shaft construction until identifying and resolving the problem. Modify the
 Drilled Shaft Installation Plan as required to document changes.
 Rejected shafts will require further investigation, evaluation, remediation,
 or replacement. Submit the proposed plan of action to the Department for
 review and acceptance. Re-evaluation of the shaft may consist of, but is not
 limited to, additional nondestructive testing and/or coring. Corrective actions
 may consist of, but are not limited to: coring, removing anomalies, and
 replacing concrete; removing the shaft concrete and extending the shaft deeper;
 providing straddle shafts or a replacement shaft; and post grouting. When
 coring is used, the method and equipment shall provide for complete core
 recovery and shall minimize abrasion and erosion of the core.
 All costs and delays associated with re-evaluation and corrective action are
 the responsibility of the contractor. Submit a plan for further investigation or
 remedial action for rejected shafts to the engineer for review and acceptance.
 Support all modifications to dimensions of shafts required by the investigation
 and remedial action plan by calculations and working drawings. All
 investigation and remedial action procedures, equipment, and designs shall be
 prepared by a registered Professional Engineer licensed in Louisiana, and
 submitted to the engineer for acceptance. Do not begin repair operations until
 receiving the engineer’s written acceptance of the investigation and remedial
 action plan.
 Dewater and fill with grout all access tubes and cored holes after
 completing tests and accepting the drilled shaft. Fill access tubes and cored
 holes using grout tubes that extend to the bottom of the tube or hole or into the
 grout already placed.

 804.03 SUBMITTALS. Conform to Section 801. Provide submittals as
 required by the contract.
 804.03.1 Pile Installation Plan: Submit a Pile Installation Plan
 describing the proposed pile driving system for review. Do not transport the
 pile driving equipment to the project site until acceptance is achieved. Submit
 the Pile Installation Plan no later than 30 calendar days prior to commencing
 pile operations. The engineer will evaluate the Pile Installation Plan for
 conformance with the plans and specifications. Within 21 calendar days after
 receipt of the Pile Installation Plan, the engineer will give notification of
 acceptance or if any additional information is required and/or changes that may
 be necessary to meet the plans and specification requirements. Resubmit any
 parts of the submittal that are rejected with changes as agreed upon for
 reevaluation. The engineer will give notification within seven calendar days
 after receipt of proposed changes, of their acceptance or rejection.
 No changes in the driving system or installation method shall be made after
 final acceptance without the concurrence of the engineer. Provide at least the
 following information in the Pile Installation Plan:
 1. Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form. The Department will supply
 this standard form. Complete the form with the proposed pile driving
 equipment for each unique pile driving system that will be used on the project.
 Separate forms shall be used for each different pile driving system according
 593
 
 to pile type and size. When a hammer cushion or pile cushion is composed of
 differing materials with varying properties, provide a detailed description of
 the composite cushion. Describe the material type, layout, and thickness of
 each cushion component.
 2. Procedures for documenting pile construction logs and names and
 contact information for assigned personnel.
 3. A list of equipment to be used to install the piles.
 Perform and supply a drivability analysis to demonstrate the adequacy of
 the hammer as indicated in 804.03.1.2 using the wave equation method.
 Calculations shall be sealed, signed, and dated by a Louisiana registered
 professional engineer.
 4. Proposed pile driving methods that may be required to facilitate pile
 driving installation such as preboring or jetting.
 5. Detailed drawings of any proposed followers.
 6. Detailed drawings of templates.
 7. Identify use and location of pile splices, shoring, sheet piling,
 cofferdams, etc.
 8. Pile driving sequence for each unique pile layout configuration.
 9. Details of proposed load test system, equipment, and procedures in
 accordance with 804.10. Calculations shall be sealed, signed, and dated by a
 Louisiana registered professional engineer.
 10. Proposed schedule for test pile and/or indicator pile program and
 production pile driving.
 11. Details of the access system for attaching instrumentation for
 dynamic monitoring.
 12. Other information shown on the plans or required by the engineer.
 804.03.1.2 Pile Driving System Drivability Analysis: Provide a
 drivability analysis using the wave equation program (WEAP) to the engineer
 for each pile type and size required on the plans. Consider all critical
 conditions (i.e., scour, excavation, etc.) to determine the estimated driving
 resistance (blows per foot), and maximum tensile and compressive stresses
 during driving and end-of-drive conditions. Analyze splices, casing used,
 prebored holes, jetting, and other driving methods, if proposed. Verify driving
 conditions at various locations if the soil conditions change within the project
 area. Acceptance of the pile driving system will be based on the wave
 equation analysis computer program and as required elsewhere in this
 subsection. Provide sealed, signed, and dated calculations by a Louisiana
 registered professional engineer. Acceptance of the pile driving system does
 
 594
 
 not relinquish responsibility for driving the piles to the required pile tip
 elevation without exceeding the allowable pile stress limitation or causing
 damage.
 The acceptance criteria used to evaluate the pile driving system from the
 wave equation will be the pile driving resistance and pile driving stresses. The
 target number of hammer blows at the required end of driving pile resistance
 for bearing piles shall be a maximum of 120 blows per foot. The pile driving
 resistance at any depth above the required pile tip elevation shall be less than
 240 blows per foot. Do not exceed the maximum allowable pile driving
 stresses in 804.07.6.
 The drivability analysis is based on the maximum driving resistance needed
 to obtain minimum penetration requirements specified on the plans, and
 overcome resistance of soil that cannot be counted upon to provide axial or
 lateral resistance throughout the design life of the structure; e.g., material
 subject to scour or down drag, and obtain the required bearing resistance.
 When the wave equation analysis shows the proposed equipment or
 methods will result in either the inability to drive the pile with a reasonable
 driving resistance to the desired pile capacity or will exceed the maximum
 allowable pile driving stresses, modify or replace the proposed methods or
 equipment at no expense to the Department until subsequent wave equation
 analyses indicate that the proposed pile driving system and driving methods
 meet the required criteria for acceptability stated herein. As mentioned above,
 ultimate acceptance of the pile driving system is contingent upon trial and
 continued satisfactory performance in the field. The engineer may require
 further modification of the driving system if field observations indicate that the
 driving system is inadequate for any of the proposed driving operations for the
 project.
 Make any required changes, including supplying additional hammers,
 which may result from unsatisfactory field performance.
 804.03.1.3 Construction Site Survey Plan: When an item is
 included in the Contract for construction site survey, submit a Construction
 Site Survey Plan to the Project Engineer for review at least 30 calendar days
 prior to mobilization to the project site.

 in the Contract for vibration monitoring, submit a Vibration Monitoring Plan to
 the Project Engineer for review at least 30 calendar days prior to commencing
 pile driving activities or construction activities that may produce vibrations.
 Describe how vibration monitoring will be performed, any equipment to be
 used, the schedule, and how the data and information will be reported.
 Comply with the plans for the limits and features to be monitored. Plan limits
 may be extended and features added by the Project Engineer. Show survey
 limits and features to be monitored.
 Do not begin pile driving operations until acceptance of the Vibration
 Monitoring Plan.
 Upon completion of pile driving operations, submit to the Project Engineer
 for record a comprehensive report for each feature monitored during the pile
 driving operations.

 Engineer for review the Vibration Monitoring Report in accordance with
 804.12.7 upon completion of pile driving activities or construction activities
 that may cause vibrations. Acceptance of the work will be contingent on
 acceptance of the Vibration Monitoring Report.
 804.03.3.2 Post-construction Site Survey: Submit to the project
 engineer for review the post-construction site survey upon completion of pile
 driving activities or construction activities which may create vibrations.
 Acceptance of the work will be contingent on acceptance of the postconstruction site survey.
 804.03.3.3 Cast-in-Place Concrete Piles: Cast-in-place concrete
 piles shall be steel encased. Steel shells shall be of the specified diameter and
 type. Shells for cast-in-place concrete piles shall be of sufficient thickness and
 strength so that the shell will hold its original form and show no harmful
 distortion after it has been driven. Determine the shell wall thickness, if
 required. Fill the shell with Class A1 concrete and place in accordance with
 Section 805. When reinforcing steel is required, comply with Section 806.
 804.04 PILE LENGTHS. Furnish piles in accordance with an itemized
 order list, which will be provided by the engineer, showing the number, size,
 length, and location of all permanent piles. Do not fabricate permanent piles
 prior to receipt of this order list. The lengths given in the order list will be the
 lengths that are assumed to remain in the completed structure after cutoff. At
 no expense to the department, increase the pile lengths to provide for fresh
 heading and for such additional length as may be necessary to suit the method
 of operation. When test piles or indicator piles are required, the pile lengths
 shown on the plans are for estimation purposes only. The approved order list
 will not be furnished until the test piles or until indicator piles have been
 driven, tested, and analyzed.
 804.05 PILE DRIVING EQUIPMENT.
 804.05.1 Hammers: Do not use non-impact hammers such as vibratory
 hammers unless specified on the plans or permitted in writing by the engineer.
 Hammers shall be rated based on the theoretical potential energy. Calibration
 597
 
 of hammers and associated equipment shall be as required by the hammer
 manufacturer.
 Provide methods and components for measuring hammer energy. For
 open-end diesel hammers, provide the Project Engineer a chart from the
 hammer manufacturer equating stroke in feet and blows per minute, and an
 approved device to determine and display ram stroke in feet.
 804.05.2 Drive System Components and Accessories:
 804.05.2.1 Hammer Cushion:
 Equip all impact pile driving equipment designed to be used with a hammer
 cushion with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent
 damage to the hammer and pile and to ensure uniform driving behavior.
 Hammer cushions shall be made of durable, manufactured materials, provided
 in accordance with the hammer manufacturer’s guidelines. Wood, wire rope,
 and asbestos hammer cushions will not be allowed. Place a striker plate, as
 recommended by the hammer manufacturer, on the hammer cushion to ensure
 uniform compression of the cushion material. Inspect the hammer cushion in
 the presence of the engineer when beginning pile driving at each structure and
 after every 100 hours of use during pile driving operations. Replace the
 cushion when the hammer cushion begins to deteriorate or when the reduction
 in thickness exceeds 25 percent of the original thickness.
 804.05.2.2 Helmet: Provide a properly sized helmet or drive head to
 piles driven with impact hammers to distribute the hammer blow to the pile
 head. Axially align the helmet with the hammer and the pile. The helmet shall
 be guided by the leads, not free-swinging. Fit the helmet around the pile head
 to prevent transfer of torsion forces during driving, while maintaining proper
 alignment of hammer and pile.
 For special types of piles, provide appropriate helmets, mandrels, or other
 devices in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 804.05.2.3 Pile Cushion: Protect the heads of precast concrete piles
 with a pile cushion made of plywood, hardwood, or a composite plywood and
 hardwood material. Store the pile cushion to prevent wetting. Wet or cracked
 cushions shall not be used. The minimum pile cushion thickness shall be
 established with the drivability analysis and modified based on field
 observation and/or dynamic monitoring results. Match pile cushion
 dimensions with the dimensions of pile. Provide a new pile cushion for each
 pile driven, unless otherwise permitted by the engineer. Replace the pile
 cushion during pile driving when the cushion begins to deteriorate or burn.
 
 598
 
 Do not determine pile resistance using a new pile cushion until after the pile
 has been driven a minimum of 5 feet or 100 blows.
 804.05.2.4 Leads: Use pile driving leads that align vertical and
 battered piles, along with the hammer, in proper position throughout the
 driving operation. Construct leads in a manner that affords freedom of
 hammer movement while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the pile to
 ensure concentric impact for each blow.
 Leads may be fixed, semi-fixed, or swinging type. Fit with a pipe gate at
 the bottom of the leads when using swinging leads. Embed leads adequately in
 the ground or the pile constrained in a structural frame, such as a template to
 maintain alignment.
 Design leads to permit proper alignment of battered piles when applicable.
 804.05.2.5 Templates: Provide a rigid and securely anchored
 template when swinging leads are used. When driving battered piles with
 swinging leads, use a two-tiered template or a template equipped with a device
 to hold the pile at the required batter. Support the bottom of the leads on the
 template. Construct the template to allow the pile to pass freely through the
 template without binding.
 804.06 PREPARATION FOR INSTALLATION OF DRIVEN PILES.
 804.06.1 Site Preparation:
 804.06.1.1 Excavation: Do not drive piles until after completing the
 excavation. Remove all material forced up between the piles to the correct
 elevation before placing concrete for the foundation.
 804.06.1.2 Abutment (End Bent) Fill: Construct the embankment
 at bridge ends to full height in accordance with 813.03 before driving affected
 piles. Drive piles through compacted embankment using prebored holes
 limited in depth to the height of the embankment.
 804.06.1.3 Cofferdams: Prior to driving any piles, monitor the
 external stability of the ground outside of the cofferdam, wall inclination, and
 depth of excavation within the cofferdam to ensure the stability of the
 cofferdam. Complete all excavation within the cofferdam prior to driving
 piles. Inspect the depth of the excavation within the cofferdam for proper
 depth with a weighted line or other accepted method.
 804.06.1.4 Cone Penetrometer Test (CPT) Assistance: When
 required by the plans, make arrangements with the Department to have the
 CPT soundings taken at least 30 calendar days prior to driving test piles or
 indicator piles. Provide equipment to assist in moving the CPT truck around
 599
 
 the site. The site for the soundings shall be level. Assist the Department in
 surveying the location and elevation of the CPT soundings.
 804.06.2 Piling Preparation:
 804.06.2.1 Transportation, Handling, and Storage of Piling:

 welding with full penetration welds in accordance with Section 809.
 Timber Piles: Furnish timber piles and drive full length.
 804.07 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 804.07.1 Preboring: The size and depth of the prebored hole shall be
 included in the Pile Installation Plan. The depth of prebored holes shall not be
 below the scour elevation, unless accepted by the Engineer of Record.
 Develop the preboring depth limits based on the soil information obtained
 from soil boring logs or CPTs. Upon installation of the pile, fill voids around
 the pile with granular material, meeting the requirements of 1003.09, and
 saturate with water.
 804.07.2 Jetting: The use of jetting shall be included in the Pile
 Installation Plan. The depth of jetting shall not be below the scour elevation,
 unless accepted by the Engineer of Record.
 Do not jet in footings, header banks, or in areas where stability of
 embankments or other structures would be endangered. Develop the jet pipe
 penetration limit to minimize the pile skin friction disturbance and to permit
 pile installation to the required pile tip elevation. Develop the jet pipe
 penetration limits based on soil information obtained from soil boring logs or
 CPTs and include in the Pile Installation Plan.
 Use only one jet pipe when pre-jetting a hole prior to placing and driving
 the pile or when driving is interrupted and the jet is placed inside a steel pipe
 pile or a voided concrete pile. Use a minimum of two jets when jetting piles
 and driving concurrently using external jets. When using concurrent jetting
 600
 
 and driving, keep the jets above the advancing pile tip. Cease jetting
 operations after reaching the jet penetration limit, and then drive the pile to the
 final tip elevation. Determine the pile resistances from the results of driving
 only after the jets have been withdrawn. Control and dispose of all jet water in
 accordance with Section 107.
 804.07.3 Followers and Underwater Hammers: Include any use of
 followers and underwater hammers in the Pile Installation Plan. Provide the
 follower with a socket or hood, carefully fitted to the pile head to minimize
 energy losses and prevent pile damage.
 804.07.4 Location and Alignment Tolerance: In pile bents, the
 horizontal location of the final top center of the pile shall be within 3 inches of
 the plan location measured perpendicular to the centerline of the cap and
 within 6 inches of plan location measured along the centerline of the cap. For
 footing piles, the horizontal location of the final top center of the pile shall be
 within 6 inches of plan location. The vertical location of the final top center of
 the pile shall be plus or minus 2 inches of plan cut-off elevation.
 The axial alignment shall be within 2 percent of the specified alignment
 shown on the plans. The axial alignment will be checked on a minimum 5 feet
 of exposed pile. The engineer may suspend driving in order to check the pile
 alignment. Do not pull laterally on piles to correct misalignment. Do not
 splice a properly aligned section onto a misaligned section or build up a
 properly aligned section onto a misaligned section.
 If the location or alignment tolerances are exceeded, provide the engineer
 with a sketch showing the actual versus plan positions of all piles in the bridge
 element along with proposed corrective measures. Corrective measures
 submitted with design documentation may be considered and reviewed by the
 Department. In pile bents, a pile with top center horizontal deviation from plan
 location measured perpendicular to the cap centerline by an amount greater
 than the specified tolerance plus 20 percent of the pile least dimension is not
 acceptable, and will require removal. The Department will not be responsible
 for any cost or time necessary for correction of out-of-tolerance piles. All
 design work shall be sealed, signed, and dated by an engineer licensed in
 Louisiana and documented on plan sheets meeting the format requirements of
 801.05.2, and included in the contract plans. Compensation to the Department
 for review and evaluation of resulting design work shall be according to
 105.03.
 804.07.5 Installation Sequence: The installation sequence for
 individual piles in a footing shall be one of the following options:
 • From the center of the pile group outward;
 601
 
 • By rows from the center of the pile group to the side; or,
 • By rows from one side of the pile group to the other side.
 804.07.6 Pile Driving Stresses: Drive the piles without exceeding the
 maximum allowable driving stresses. For steel piles, do not exceed a
 compressive driving stress of 90 percent of the yield stress of the pile material.
 For timber piles, do not exceed a compressive driving stress of 3600 psi. For
 precast prestressed concrete piles, do not exceed the tensile and compressive
 driving stresses in Table 804-1.

 If indicated on the plans, use the allowable driving stresses for a corrosive
 environment.
 804.07.7 Extent of Driving: Drive piles to the plan tip elevation or the
 order list tip elevation in accordance with the plans and specifications. If the
 penetration requirements and bearing capacity are achieved within 5 feet above
 the plan tip elevation or order list tip elevation, the engineer may consider
 penetration and capacity requirements to be satisfied. If penetration and
 bearing capacity requirements are not achieved within 5 feet above the plan tip
 elevation or order list tip elevation, acceptance from the engineer of record
 shall be required to terminate pile driving. Pile embedment shall not be less
 than 20 feet below the bridge scour elevation, unless indicated on the plans.
 Use the following requirements to evaluate satisfactory penetration and
 resistance.
 804.07.7.1 Pile Penetration Requirements: Practical refusal
 blow count depends on the site soil profile, the pile type, and hammer
 manufacturer limitations to prevent hammer damage. Practical refusal is
 broadly defined as a rate of 20 blows per inch at maximum stroke, for
 
 602
 
 3 consecutive inches. However, depending on site conditions, this criterion
 may not always be applicable. If practical refusal is encountered above the
 required plan tip elevation or order list tip elevation, a larger hammer capable
 of achieving the required penetration or pile installation techniques, such as
 preboring or jetting, may be required. Assure that the hammer is in proper
 working order. If hammer performance needs to be evaluated, the engineer
 may require dynamic monitoring. If the hammer performance indicates that
 pile driving system efficiency is not satisfactory, adjust the pile driving system
 until satisfactory performance is observed. Obtain written acceptance from the
 engineer before implementing changes to the accepted Pile Installation Plan,
 including early termination of driving. The cost of dynamic monitoring due to
 unsatisfactory hammer performance and any resulting delays shall be at no
 expense to the Department.
 804.07.7.2 Pile Resistance Requirements: Determine pile
 resistance throughout driving in accordance with 804.09 and the plan
 information.
 If pile resistance is less than expected, leave the pile approximately 1 foot
 above cut-off elevation to allow for evaluation. One or more of the following
 actions may be taken as coordinated with the Chief Construction Engineer:
 perform a restrike to check for increased resistance due to soil set-up, load pile
 to determine its ultimate resistance, or continue to drive until obtaining
 satisfactory resistance. If resistance results are affected by excess pore water
 pressure, or if this condition was observed during field testing of test,
 indicator, or monitor piles, perform restrikes as directly by the engineer to
 determine resistance after sufficient dissipation of excess pore water pressure
 has occurred.
 804.07.8 Production Pile Restrikes: Perform all pile restrikes with a
 warm hammer that has applied a minimum of 20 blows to another pile or
 dummy block immediately before being used to restrike the selected pile. For
 precast concrete piles, use the original pile cushion used during initial driving.
 If the original pile cushion used to drive precast concrete piles is no longer in
 acceptable condition, use another similarly used cushion that is in acceptable
 condition. During restrike, achieve a maximum penetration of 3 inches or a
 maximum of 20 blows, whichever occurs first. Report restrike blow counts as
 the number of hammer blows per increment of 1 inch.
 804.07.9 Heaved Piles: If pile heave is observed, take level readings
 referenced to a fixed datum on all piles within a 15-feet radius after installation
 and periodically thereafter as adjacent piles are driven to determine the pile
 heave range. Continue measurements until the engineer determines that such
 603
 
 checking is no longer required. Redrive all end bearing piles that have heaved
 more than ½ inch to the required resistance or penetration at no expense to the
 Department. Do not place concrete in pile casings until all piles in a footing
 have been driven.
 804.07.10 Pile Extensions:
 804.07.10.1 Cast-in-Place Extension of Precast Concrete
 Piles: A cast-in-place extension, excluding cutback, of 5 feet maximum is
 allowed when constructed in accordance with the plans. Driving the pile
 extension is not allowed. The final cut of the concrete shall be perpendicular
 to the axis of the pile. Thoroughly clean and wet the top of the pile prior to
 placing concrete.
 804.07.10.2 Steel Piles: When permitted or shown on the plans,
 extend a steel pile by welding splice in accordance with Section 809.
 804.07.11 Pile Cut-Offs
 804.07.11.1 Precast Concrete Piles: Cut off perpendicular to the
 axis of the pile at the cut-off elevation shown on the plans. Exercise care to
 minimize spalling of concrete below the cut-off elevation.
 804.07.11.2 Steel Piles: Cut off perpendicular to the axis of the pile
 at the cut-off elevation shown on the plans. Cuts shall be made in clean
 straight lines. Correct all irregularities due to cutting or burning by grinding or
 depositing weld material prior to placing caps.
 804.07.11.3 Timber Piles: Saw off horizontally or as shown on the
 plans at the specified cut-off elevation. When piles support timber caps, saw to
 a horizontal plane or to the slope specified to fit the cap. Do not shim on tops
 of piles. Treatment of pile heads shall conform to 812.06.
 804.07.11.4 Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles: Cut off perpendicular
 to the axis of the pile at the cut-off elevation shown on the plans after pile
 shells are fully driven, inspected, and accepted.
 804.08 UNSATISFACTORY PILES. All damaged piles with diagonal or
 longitudinal cracking, transverse cracking, or other unsatisfactory conditions
 will be inspected by the engineer for further evaluation.
 Correct all piles that do not meet location and alignment tolerances, do not
 achieve required resistance, or sustain damage. Do not manipulate piles to
 force them into proper position. All replaced or repaired piles shall be
 corrected at no expense to the Department.
 
 604
 
 804.08.1 Concrete Pile Repair: Cracked concrete piles will be
 rejected unless repaired as follows:
 1. Piles with diagonal or longitudinal cracks will be rejected unless the pile
 meets the required penetration and resistance and can be cut off below the
 crack and extended with an approved structural repair.
 2. Repair transverse cracks that show evidence of spalling with a patch and
 epoxy injection or a structural buildup.
 3. Use epoxy injection to repair transverse cracks that show dusting during
 driving. Stop driving at the first sign of dusting and inject an epoxy into the
 crack to cure in accordance with the epoxy manufacturer’s recommendations
 before driving is resumed. Use an approved epoxy product listed in the AML
 in accordance with Section 1017.
 4. Repair minor hairline surface cracks in corrosive environments. In noncorrosive environments, minor hairline surface cracks will not be cause for
 rejection or repair, provided no change in the crack condition occurs during
 driving.
 804.08.2 Steel Pile Repair: Damaged steel piles will be rejected unless
 repaired by removing damaged sections and replacement by a new steel section
 with full penetration welding in accordance with Section 809; replace
 protective coating in accordance with Section 811, when applicable.
 804.08.3 Timber Pile Repair: If a timber pile breaks or splits
 longitudinally before reaching 5 feet of final tip elevation, it shall be rejected,
 removed, and replaced. If a timber pile has reached final tip elevation, but
 mushrooms at the top, it may be accepted if approved by the engineer.
 804.09 DETERMINATION OF PILE RESISTANCE. Pile resistance is
 obtained during the end-of-driving or pile restrike. Determine the pile
 resistance by use of the test pile loading results, wave equation, dynamic load
 testing, or FHWA Modified Gates dynamic formula when specified on the
 plans.
 804.10 FIELD TESTING PILES. Install test piles, indicator piles, or
 monitor piles of the length, number, size, and type specified at the location and
 penetration shown on the plans. Use the accepted Pile Installation Plan when
 installing piles. Consideration shall be given to the location of instrumentation
 with respect to mudline, template location, or water surface to avoid damage to
 the instrumentation. Add a minimum length of 2.5 times the pile size to test
 and indicator piles for attaching the dynamic testing instrumentation.
 605
 
 Permanent piles may require field testing if indicated on the plans or as
 determined by the engineer.
 804.10.1 Ultimate Pile Resistance: Ultimate pile resistance is the
 resistance that has been determined from either a static or dynamic load test of
 a test pile, indicator pile, or permanent pile.
 804.10.2 Test Piles: Test piles are piles driven in advance of the
 permanent piles for purposes of determining pile length by static load testing.
 Test piles shall be long enough to be re-driven, if necessary, to the plan tip
 elevation of the nearest permanent pile. Test pile length shall be long enough
 to permit static load testing and dynamic monitoring for the driven length.
 Test piles shall be a new fabrication of the same design and cross section as the
 permanent piles it represents. Variations shall be accepted by the Chief
 Construction Engineer. The Fabrication Engineer shall be notified one week
 prior to casting. All test piles and/or indicator piles will be inspected by
 DOTD Fabrication Inspectors prior to delivery to the project.
 804.10.3 Indicator Piles: Indicator piles follow the same specifications
 as test piles, except that a static load test is not anticipated. Indicator piles will
 require dynamic monitoring.
 804.10.4 Monitor Piles: Monitor piles are permanent piles monitored
 during driving and restrikes using dynamic monitoring. The monitor pile is
 paid for as a permanent pile.
 804.10.5 Pile Restrikes: Perform pile restrikes for test piles, indicator
 piles, or monitor piles in accordance with the time intervals specified below
 unless shown otherwise on the plans or as directed by the engineer. Restrike
 test piles within 24 hours after initial installation and make another restrike
 within 24 hours after load test. Perform a 24-hour and a 14-day restrike on
 indicator piles and a 24-hour restrike on monitor piles.
 804.10.6 Test Site Preparation: Test pile and/or indicator pile shall
 model the subsurface conditions of the permanent piles at the most critical
 location. At the test pile location, excavate all overburden to the elevation
 shown on the plans and keep this excavation open during driving and loading.
 In lieu of the above, drive the test pile within an approved metal casing.
 Provide a rigid and securely anchored template when swinging leads are used
 as specified in 804.05.2.5. Alignment tolerances of 804.07.4 shall apply.
 Provide any bracing or strengthening of the test pile required during loading or
 driving operations.
 Fill cast-in-place concrete piles with concrete in accordance with 804.03;
 allow the concrete to set for at least 48 hours and attain a minimum
 compressive strength of 4000 psi before load testing.
 606
 
 804.10.7 Static Load Test:
 Load piles in accordance with
 ASTM D1143, Procedure A: Quick Test, except as noted below. Load piles at
 least 14 calendar days after initial driving unless otherwise directed by the
 engineer. All pile loading results will be evaluated by the engineer to
 determine pile length.
 804.10.7.1 Loading Procedure: Apply the load in at least 20 equal
 increments or as directed. Hold each load increment for a period of five
 minutes. Load the pile to failure or until reaching the specified maximum test
 load shown on the plans. The pile will be considered to have failed when
 continuous jacking is required and continuous pile movement is measured.
 Unless otherwise directed, maintain load until the gross settlement has reached
 10 percent of the pile width or diameter.
 After the plunging load and failure deformation have been achieved, allow
 the loading system to equalize until pile movement and variations in jack
 pressure have ceased.
 Remove load in decrements of 20 percent of the maximum load placed on
 the pile. Record gross settlement and load readings five minutes after reaching
 each unloading load decrement. Record the final recovery of the unloaded pile
 until movement is essentially complete for a period up to 30 minutes.
 804.10.7.2 Hydraulic Jack: Calibrate the entire hydraulic system
 for all stages of loading and unloading through an accepted independent
 calibration service. Provide a certified laboratory report of the calibration tests
 to the engineer. This calibration shall be performed no more than 30 days prior
 to load test commencement. After the system is calibrated, no replacement
 parts will be permitted (except the pump) without recalibration of the system.
 804.10.7.3 Displacement
 Instrumentation:
 Furnish
 instrumentation to monitor the gross displacement readings at the pile head
 during load testing. The instrumentation shall consist of three independent dial
 or electronic readout gauges capable of measuring displacement to a precision
 of ± 0.001 inches, with a minimum travel range of 4 inches or 15 percent of
 maximum pile width or diameter for circular piles, whichever is greater.
 Provide smooth bearing surfaces perpendicular to the direction of the gauge
 stem travel for each gauge.
 804.10.8 Dynamic Load Test: Assist the Department in obtaining
 dynamic measurements with the Department’s dynamic monitoring of test
 piles, indicator piles, monitor piles, and permanent piles during initial pile
 driving and during pile restrikes. Supply a temporary tent or shelter of
 sufficient size to cover the instruments and the operator/engineer from direct
 sunlight and rain during the dynamic test.
 607
 
 The cost of equipment, mobilization, or any delays due to dynamic
 monitoring shall be included in the item for Dynamic Monitoring Assistance.
 804.10.9 Dynamic Monitoring Scheduling: Notify the project
 engineer at least 14 calendar days before the scheduled date of driving piles to
 be monitored. In addition, a minimum 24-hour-notice shall be given for
 projects staffed with full-time dynamic testing personnel. Allow a possible
 three calendar day delay for any scheduling conflicts of the Department’s pile
 monitoring personnel. Confirm the driving date three working days prior to
 the scheduled driving date. The pile to be monitored and the pile driving
 equipment shall be on site and at the location to be driven at least 24 hours
 prior to monitoring. Test the pile driving equipment the day prior to dynamic
 monitoring to ensure that it is in proper working order. The project engineer
 will notify the engineer to confirm that the pile and all associated pile driving
 equipment are on site, have been inspected and assembled, and are ready for
 driving operations at least 24 hours prior to dynamic monitoring. Allow for a
 possible seven day delay when rescheduling is required due to contractor
 delay. Once the three day notification is provided and monitoring personnel
 are mobilized, the contractor will be back charged for all costs arising from
 contractor delays in pile testing.
 804.10.10 Dynamic Monitoring Assistance: Prepare attachment
 points for attaching dynamic monitoring instrumentation as shown on the
 plans. Furnish and install anchors for concrete piles and drill and tap holes for
 steel piles. Provide an AC power source at the location where the dynamic
 monitoring computer will be placed during the monitoring. No welding shall
 take place in the general vicinity during dynamic monitoring operations.
 When directed by the engineer, make piles available prior to driving for
 drilling or tapping holes. Provide safe, stable, and OSHA approved access to
 the pile head with a working area of not less than 16 square feet and equip so
 that the platform may be raised to the top of the pile while the pile is located in
 the leads and that sufficient distance down from the top of the pile can be
 achieved as specified in 804.10. Include details of the access system for
 attaching instrumentation for dynamic monitoring in the Pile Installation Plan.
 Include one hour in the Pile Installation Plan for the attachment of instruments
 to the pile for each monitoring event. Occasionally, the pile driving may have
 to be temporarily interrupted for the transducers to be adjusted or replaced, or
 the monitoring results assessed. Use reasonable care when working with the
 instruments and accessories. At no expense to the Department, replace any
 dynamic monitoring equipment damaged by the contractor.
 
 608
 
 804.10.11 Dynamic Monitoring Instrumentation. Furnish dynamic
 pile monitoring instrumentation and accessories, as specified on the plans, to
 be used during all pile driving operations. Purchase new dynamic pile
 monitoring instrumentation compatible with the Department’s dynamic pile
 monitoring device. Submit a list of equipment for review and acceptance
 before any items are purchased. Order equipment within 10 days of receipt of
 the Notice to Proceed. Allow eight weeks delivery time for the new dynamic
 pile monitoring instrumentation items. Deliver equipment to the Department’s
 Pavement and Geotechnical Services Section, 1201 Capitol Access Road,
 Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70804. Instrumentation will become the property of
 the Department upon completion of all pile driving monitoring. Provide
 warranty information, manuals, documentation, and invoice copies to the
 Department’s Pavement and Geotechnical Services Section upon delivery of
 equipment. Register all warranties in the name of the Department.
 804.10.12 Redriving Test or Indicator Piles: When steel piles fail to
 reach the required ultimate pile resistance, requiring redriving, extend steel
 piles by splicing if necessary and redrive as directed.
 Do not extend or redrive precast concrete, cast-in-place concrete test piles
 or indicator piles. Drive a new test pile to the designated depth at an accepted
 location.
 804.10.13 Test Pile and Indicator Pile Removal: If test piles or
 indicator piles are not to be used as permanent piles, remove to a minimum of
 3 feet below natural ground or stream bed or as shown on the plans; dispose of
 as directed.
 When the resistance of a permanent pile is less than the required resistance,
 the engineer may direct loading of a permanent pile. When loading a
 permanent pile, conduct the loading in accordance with the procedure given
 in 804.10.7.1, except the test load will be as directed by the engineer.
 804.11 CONSTRUCTION SITE SURVEY. A construction site survey
 consists of a Pre-construction Site Survey and Post-construction Site Survey.

 driving activities or construction activities which may create vibrations,
 perform a Post-construction Site Survey in accordance with 804.11.1.
 804.12 VIBRATION MONITORING. Perform vibration monitoring in and
 around sensitive features as indicated in the Vibration Monitoring Plan, the
 Contract or as directed by the Project Engineer. Sensitive features may include
 archaeological sites, historic features, utilities, instruments, structures, etc.
 Use the services of a testing lab and a vibration specialist engineer,
 acceptable to the Project Engineer to develop the vibration monitoring plan and
 conduct seismic monitoring of vibrations during pile driving and other heavy
 equipment operations in areas that are not normally subjected to such
 operations. Render complete reports and interpretations of the data obtained
 including the possible effects of the measured vibrations on adjacent and
 surrounding structures. Acquire baseline vibration data for a period of at least
 24 hours prior to beginning construction activities.
 611
 
 Perform vibration monitoring during Test Pile and Production Pile driving
 operations to verify that vibrations from construction activities are below
 required threshold values. Modify construction methods as necessary to stay
 below threshold values.
 Peak particle velocity (PPV) is the maximum rate of change of position of a
 soil particle with respect to time, measured on the ground. The velocity
 magnitude is given in units of inches per second.
 Frequency of vibration is the number of oscillations that occur in 1 second.
 The frequency units given are in hertz (cycles per second).
 Provide seismic monitoring of vibrations during pile driving and other
 heavy equipment operations in areas subjected to such operations as specified
 on the plans. Use an independent third party Louisiana registered professional
 engineer to provide complete reports and interpretations of the data obtained
 including the possible effects of the measured vibrations on adjacent and
 surrounding structures.
 804.12.1 Equipment and Instrumentation: Provide seismograph(s)
 with self-triggering units(s), accepted by the Project Engineer, and capable of
 recording three mutually perpendicular components (longitude, transverse, and
 vertical) of ground motion time histories, in terms of particle velocity. Provide
 units capable of reporting the frequency as well as the peak values for all
 vibration time histories.
 The seismographs shall be Type I waveform recorders. It provides a
 particle velocity wave form or time history of the recorded event, sometimes in
 conjunction with peak event information. Independent chart recorders with
 separate motion transducers can be used in place of "stand-alone" monitors like
 seismographs when accepted by the Project Engineer.
 804.12.2 Number and Location: Place seismographs and ground
 transducers in the ground outside and adjacent to the structure(s) or feature(s)
 to be monitored on the side facing the construction activity. Monitor
 structure(s) in accordance with the Vibration Monitoring Plan, the Contract,
 and as directed by the Project Engineer. Exact transducer number and locations
 shall be as directed by the Louisiana registered professional engineer.
 Vibration monitoring distance (VMD) is the distance from the construction
 activity to the limits of monitoring. Comply with the limits shown in Table
 804-2, the Contract, and the Vibration Monitoring Plan.

 The number of seismographs required is dependent on the specific site. As
 a minimum, two seismographs of Type I are required on site. One
 seismograph will be used on site with one or more held in reserve for use at a
 specific complaint or potential complaint location.
 804.12.3 Transducer Attachment (Coupling). Place transducers on
 the measurement surface and cover with heavy sandbags as directed by the
 Louisiana registered professional engineer.
 804.12.4 Particle Velocity Controls and Threshold Limits: Limit
 ground particle velocity so that structural damage due to pile driving is
 avoided. Measure Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) with instrumentation and
 methods described 804.12.1. Peak particle velocity shall satisfy the following
 controls:
 1. Limit PPV to values less than a specific control limit at the nearest
 structure, which is summarized in Table 804-3 for different types of
 structures.
 2. Record particle velocities in three mutually perpendicular axes. The
 maximum allowable peak particle velocity reading will be that of any of
 the three axes.

 804.12.5 Monitoring Ground Vibrations: Monitor ground vibrations
 at specified locations. All three components (longitudinal, transverse, and
 vertical) of particle velocity shall be measured and recorded. Background
 vibrations due to passing traffic or other activities should also be monitored
 prior to pile driving activities to establish a baseline.
 Maintain a pile driving log for the full length of penetration and submit
 daily reports to the Project Engineer on piles driven and vibrations measured in
 accordance with 804.03.3. These logs shall be in the form specified in the Pile
 Installation Plan.
 804.12.6 Application of the Particle Velocity Control: If 80
 percent of the limiting particle velocity shown in Table 804-3 for the structure
 monitored is exceeded for any single axis, cease pile driving operations or the
 construction activity causing vibration, and notify the Project Engineer with a
 written report. Include in the report driving information, vibration
 measurement data, and the proposed corrective action. The Project Engineer
 will make a determination before proceeding with pile driving operations.
 If 100 percent of the limiting particle velocity shown in Table 804-3 for the
 structure monitored is exceeded or more, cease operations and notify the
 Project Engineer with a written report. Include in the report driving
 information, vibration measurement data, and the proposed corrective action.
 Evaluate alternative pile installation equipment and techniques in case
 corrective/mitigation action is not effective. Adjusting pile driving operations
 will be at no additional cost or time to the Department.
 Do not commence with pile driving operations until the Project Engineer
 acknowledges in writing that a pile installation change has been implemented.
 Modify the Pile Installation Plan accordingly.
 Notify the Project Engineer immediately if visual inspection indicates that
 damage to structure(s) may be occurring due to vibrations, or if property
 owners claim damage due to vibrations. Additional vibration monitoring or
 construction site survey may be required.

 805.03 FORMS.
 805.03.1 Design and Construction: Comply with Section 817.
 Forms shall be mortar tight, designed and constructed so that finished concrete
 conforms to specified dimensions and contours. If required, design and
 construct forms to accommodate partial removal for finishing operations.
 Where lower formed spaces are inaccessible, leave lower form sections
 loose so that they may be removed for cleaning formed spaces immediately
 before placing concrete. As far as practical, design forms so that form marks
 will conform to general lines of the structure.
 When possible, forms shall be daylighted at intervals not greater than
 10 feet vertically with openings sufficient to permit free access for inspection
 and working the concrete.
 Set and maintain forms true to required line and grade until concrete
 sufficiently hardens.
 When concrete is formed by soil, provide firm soil or compacted material.
 805.03.2 Form Surface: Forms for exposed concrete surfaces shall not
 adhere to nor discolor concrete. Chamfer forms for exterior corners and round
 interior corners to prevent sharp corners. Bevel or draft projections and
 penetrations to ensure easy removal.
 Treat forms with an approved form release agent prior to placement of
 reinforcing steel. Do not use release agents that will adhere to or discolor
 concrete.
 Prior to treating form surfaces and placing concrete, clean the interior of
 forms of dirt, sawdust, shavings, and all other debris.
 
 620
 
 805.03.3 Form Ties: Design and construct form ties to withstand the
 forces of concrete placement and other applied loads. Construct metal ties or
 anchorages within forms to permit their removal to a depth of at least 1/2 inch
 from the face without damage to concrete.
 805.03.4 Formwork and Surface Tolerances: Provide hardened
 concrete finish lines in accordance with plan dimensions and the tolerances
 specified in Table 805-2 prior to removal of formwork and shores. For
 tolerances not shown, conform to ACI 117.
 For non-conforming formwork or concrete surfaces, submit a proposed
 corrective action plan to the Project Engineer for review. Include proposed
 repair locations, limits, and procedures. Repair procedures determined by the
 Department to be potentially detrimental to the structure or its performance
 will not be permitted. Do not begin corrective action until submittal
 acceptance.

 805.05 HANDLING AND PLACING CONCRETE.
 805.05.1 General: Prior to placing concrete, submit a concrete
 placement plan to the engineer that will result in sound concrete, in the correct
 location and conforming to plan dimensions for record.
 In preparation for placing concrete, remove all sawdust, chips, and other
 debris from form interiors. Inspect forms then saturate with water immediately
 prior to placing concrete.
 Strip forms, inspect, and allow substructure concrete to attain compressive
 strength of at least 4000 psi prior to placement of superstructure loads.
 Place concrete without segregating materials and without displacing
 reinforcement.
 Discontinue operations if placement methods cause
 segregation, impede workability, or produce other detrimental effects.
 When placing operations involve dropping concrete more than 5 feet,
 deposit it through a tremie or other accepted means identified in the concrete
 placement plan.
 Consolidate concrete during and immediately after depositing by
 mechanical vibration, subject to the following provisions:Use internal vibration
 unless authorization for other methods is obtained or provided herein.
 1. Use vibrators capable of transmitting vibrations to concrete at
 frequencies of at least 4500 impulses per minute.
 2. Vibrate with intensity that visibly affects concrete over a diameter of at
 least 18 inches. Vibrate with sufficient duration and intensity to thoroughly
 consolidate concrete without causing segregation. Limit vibration at any one
 point as required to prevent localized areas of grout forming.
 3. Provide a sufficient number of vibrators to properly place and
 consolidate each concrete batch.
 
 624
 
 4. Manipulate vibrators to thoroughly work concrete around reinforcement
 and embedded fixtures and into corners and angles of forms. Apply vibration
 at the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited concrete. Insert and
 withdraw vibrators slowly and vertically to and from the concrete. Apply
 vibrators at points uniformly spaced and which overlap the visibly affected
 zones.
 5. Do not vibrate directly against reinforcement. Take special care when
 reinforcement is in sections or layers of concrete which are between initial and
 final set.
 6. Supplement vibration by spading as necessary to ensure smooth surfaces
 and dense concrete along form surfaces, in corners, and locations inaccessible
 to vibrators. Provide methods in the concrete placement plan.
 7. Reduce the number and size of trapped air cavities (bug holes) in the
 formed concrete surfaces to minimize finishing.
 8. Place concrete in horizontal layers no more than 15 inches thick unless
 otherwise permitted. Place and consolidate each layer before the preceding
 layer has achieved initial set to prevent damage to green concrete and avoid
 planes of separation between lifts.
 9. When an emergency results in less than a complete layer being placed in
 one operation, terminate placement with a temporary vertical bulkhead. Prior
 to continuing placement, the quality of the initial placement and the location of
 the construction joint will be evaluated for acceptance. Some remediation may
 be required. Construction joints are to be in accordance with 805.05.8.
 10. During concrete placements, wash and remove any materials that adhere
 to the surface of adjacent members. Following concrete placement, remove
 accumulations of mortar splashed on reinforcement steel and forms. Do not
 mix dried mortar chips and dust in fresh concrete.
 11. Protect any installed projection (reinforcement, anchor bolt, etc.) from
 disturbance between initial and final set of concrete.
 805.05.2 Reinforced Concrete Box Culvert: Furnish structures of
 either cast-in-place concrete or precast concrete units. Install precast units in
 accordance with Section 701. The maximum joint opening between precast
 sections is 0.75 inches. Construct each headwall monolithically, unless
 otherwise specified. Headwall installations include wingwalls and supporting
 footings in accordance with the plans.
 At the time of final acceptance, clean concrete box culverts of debris and
 soil to the culvert invert.
 
 625
 
 805.05.2.1 Cast-in-Place: When box culverts are constructed in
 segments, vertical construction joints shall be perpendicular to the axis of the
 culvert.
 For culverts 4 feet or less in height, walls and top slab may be constructed
 monolithically. For culverts more than 4 feet in height, walls shall be placed
 independently from the top slab placement.
 805.05.3 Footings, Columns, Walls, Caps, and Girders: Deposit
 concrete uniformly the full length of the element and bring up evenly in
 horizontal layers. Place concrete in forms with no standing water. Use
 monolithic placement unless otherwise specified or allowed by the engineer.
 Place concrete between construction joints in a continuous operation. Prior
 to placing subsequent concrete sections, previously placed sections shall be
 capable of supporting applied loads.
 Concrete supporting formwork shall have attained at least 3000 psi
 compressive strength prior to placing concrete.
 805.05.4 Slab Spans and Girder Decks: Place concrete full depth
 and full width between vertical bulkheads in one continuous operation for each
 placement in accordance with the placement sequence specified in the plans.
 Submit proposed alterations to the specified placement sequence to the
 Engineer of Record with supporting calculations for review. Review of
 proposed alterations to the placement sequence will be at no expense to the
 Department.
 Placement shall not induce stresses in previously placed concrete which is
 between initial and final set.
 Use placement rates in accordance with Table 805-5.

 805.05.4.1 Slab Spans: Anchor void forms to prevent movement
 during placement of concrete in voided slabs. Forming concrete with soil is
 not allowed for slab spans.
 
 626
 
 805.05.4.2 Girder Decks:
 Provide sufficient supervision,
 manpower, equipment, tools, and materials to assure proper production,
 placement, and finish of concrete for each placement in accordance with
 minimum placement rates specified in Table 805-5. If minimum placement
 rate is not achieved, the engineer may reject the placement. Further placement
 of similar nature and size will not be permitted until corrective measures have
 been taken to assure that the minimum placement rate can be met.
 The contractor is responsible for line and grade control. Verify girder
 camber prior to constructing risers. Construct riser elevations to accommodate
 actual girder camber and vertical curvature to maintain cast-in-place deck plan
 thickness.
 805.05.5 End-On-Construction: Use end-on-construction only for
 slab span bridges, either cast-in-place concrete or precast concrete, when the
 construction cannot be conducted from the ground or it is impractical to work
 from the water surface. Provide to the engineer a submittal document
 requesting permission to use end-on-construction. Include drawings and
 analysis demonstrating construction loads will not adversely affect members.
 Construction loads include dead loads, live loads, impact, wind loads, etc.
 Include details of matting systems, crane specifications, dimensions, lifting
 loads, and corresponding extension distance from the crane. The drawings and
 calculations shall be stamped, signed and dated by a professional civil engineer
 registered in Louisiana.
 Do not begin end-on-construction activity until the Department’s
 acceptance of the submittal. Acceptance of the end-on-construction submittal
 will not relieve the contractor from responsibility for safe and successful
 completion of the work. Repair all damage to the structure caused by related
 construction activities at no cost to the Department.
 805.05.6 Conveying Concrete: Arrange equipment so that no
 vibration damages freshly placed concrete. Operate conveyance mechanisms
 to prevent segregation of concrete. Supply a homogenous stream of concrete.
 805.05.7 Depositing Concrete Underwater: When required by the
 plans or allowed by the engineer, concrete may be placed under water.
 Place concrete without segregation and in one continuous placement using a
 tremie. Refer to 803.05.9 for tremie requirements. Provide a surface as level
 as possible. A leveling course may be allowed for seal concrete after
 dewatering subject to design considerations.
 Prior to constructing subsequent placements, remove laitance and other
 unsatisfactory material from the construction joint surface without damaging
 the concrete.
 627
 
 805.05.8 Construction Joints: Construction joints with reinforcement
 crossing the plane of the joint shall conform to the following. Install
 construction joints only where located on the plans or shown on the placement
 schedule. Do not install construction joints between levels of mean low water
 and mean high water. Submit proposed construction joint locations not shown
 in the plans for review by the Engineer of Record.
 Roughen the surface of hardened concrete without leaving loosened
 particles of aggregate or damaged concrete. Thoroughly clean the roughened
 surface of foreign matter and laitance immediately prior to placing subsequent
 concrete.
 Allow at least seven days between adjacent placements. Achieve bonding
 as follows.
 805.05.8.1 Neat Cement Slurry: Thoroughly saturate hardened
 concrete with water and place adequate neat cement slurry at the joint. Place
 new concrete before the slurry has attained its initial set. Place concrete
 continuously from joint to joint. Finish joints true to plan line and elevation.
 805.05.8.2 Epoxy Resin: Coat vertical concrete surfaces of
 construction joints prior to each subsequent placement with an accepted epoxy
 resin conforming to Section 1017. Apply in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. A maximum of 2 inches of reinforcing steel
 may be coated with a thin layer of epoxy at the joint interface.
 805.05.9 Water Stops: Place water stops of metal, rubber, or plastic
 conforming to 1005.07 as shown on the plans. Where joint movement is to be
 provided, use waterstops of a type permitting such movement without damage.
 Splice waterstops in conformance with manufacturer’s recommendations to
 form continuous watertight joints.
 805.06 CURING. Use wet cure method for all concrete unless specified
 herein or permitted otherwise. Cure precast concrete in accordance with
 805.09.4.
 Cure all concrete a minimum of seven curing days. The curing day is
 defined as 24 hours in which the temperature is above 50°F and if binary or
 ternary mixes used, 55°F. Colder days may be counted if accepted methods
 are used to maintain the specified minimum air temperature adjacent to
 concrete.
 Do not permit salt water to come in contact with concrete for at least
 30 days.
 805.06.1 Wet Cure Method: Wet cure concrete utilizing burlap,
 combined burlap and white polyethylene, or other acceptable blanket materials.
 628
 
 Immediately cover the exposed concrete after finishing with two thicknesses
 of wet burlap or an approved equivalent. Secure blanket so that it is in contact
 with the concrete at all times. After placement, keep the concrete continuously
 wet for at least 7 curing days.
 805.06.2 Membrane Cure Method: For curing concrete in minor
 drainage structures, bridge substructures, and diaphragms, a membrane curing
 compound in accordance with 1011.01 may be substituted for wet curing when
 surfaces do not require a Class 2 or Class 3 finish. When membrane curing is
 used, cover or shield exposed reinforcing steel and construction joint surfaces
 to prevent coating with curing compound. Wet cure construction joint
 surfaces.
 Seal concrete surfaces in contact with forms immediately after form
 removal. Apply curing membrane as soon as surface moisture has evaporated.
 Method and application rate of curing compound shall be in accordance with
 the manufacturer’s recommendations, but the application rate shall not be less
 than one gallon per 100 square feet of surface area. Apply the compound in
 one or two applications. If the compound is applied in two applications, apply
 the second application no more than 30 minutes after first application.
 After final application of curing compound, the surface should have the
 appearance of a blank white sheet of paper.
 If rain falls on newly-coated concrete before the film has dried sufficiently
 to resist damage, or if the film is damaged, apply a new coat of compound to
 affected surfaces.
 805.06.3 Form Curing Method: Form curing, in which the concrete
 remains in forms that have not been disturbed, is an acceptable method for
 formed surfaces. Wet cure or membrane cure unformed surfaces as specified
 in 805.06.
 805.06.4 Deck Curing: Maintain the deck in surface saturated
 condition using foggers until application of curing compound. Use a
 membrane cure with a Type 2 curing compound immediately after final
 texturing as an interim curing measure in accordance with 601.03.10. Exposed
 reinforcing steel and joints shall be covered or shielded to prevent contact with
 curing compound. Use wet curing methods when concrete has set sufficiently
 to support blanketing materials without marring the surface.
 Close the deck to all traffic, including vehicles of the contractor, until
 concrete has been in place and cured for 14 curing days and has attained
 4000 psi compressive strength.
 
 629
 
 805.07 REMOVAL OF FORMS AND FALSEWORK. Remove support
 forms and falsework without overstressing the concrete and in such a manner
 as to permit concrete to uniformly and gradually take stresses due to its own
 weight. During continued cold weather, when accepted artificial heating
 methods are not provided, the engineer may permit removal of forms and
 falsework at the end of a period of calendar days equal to two times the
 number of curing days specified.
 Remove support forms and falsework in accordance with the strength
 requirements of Table 805-6 and time requirements of Table 805-7.
 Remove side forms in accordance with Table 805-6.

 805.09.7.3 Strand Tensioning Requirements:
 Prior to use in fabrication, calibrate jacks with their gauges using an
 approved independent calibration service. Provide a calibration certificate to
 the DOTD Construction Section. Recalibrate if a jack or gauge appears to be
 giving erratic results or if gauge pressure and elongations do not correlate.
 Several members may be cast in a continuous line and stressed at one time.
 Leave sufficient space between ends of members to permit access for cutting
 strands after concrete has attained required strength. Leave sufficient free
 strand between concrete members to prevent member cracking during curing
 and detensioning.
 Tension strands with calibrated equipment. If hydraulic jacks are used,
 equip them with gauges with graduations of 100 pounds and accurate within 2
 percent of the specified force shown on the plans. Provide means for
 measuring elongation to the nearest 1/8 inch ± 1/16 inch.
 Bring strands to a uniform initial tension shown on the shop drawing or
 agreed to with DOTD fabrication supervisor but at least 2,000 pounds prior to
 full tensioning. Measure this initial tension by gauge reading or other accepted
 means.
 For final strand tensioning, measure strand force by elongation and then
 verify by gauge reading.
 Provide elongation and tension force calculations to account for all losses
 (chuck seating, abutment rotation, full bed shortening, etc.) to achieve the
 specified force shown on the plans. Keep a record of strand elongation and
 jacking force for each strand.
 A gauge reading jacking force greater than 5 percent of calculated force
 required based on elongation will initiate an investigation and corrective
 action. In case of a discrepancy, place the error on the side of a slight
 overstress. Limit gauge reading jacking force to a temporary strand stress of
 no more than 81 percent of the specified strand tensile strength.
 Detension each strand in accordance with the sequence shown on the shop

 After 28 days, the Department will test two cylinders for acceptance. Both
 28-day concrete cylinders must attain the minimum required strength or
 members involved are subject to rejection.
 If all cylinders have been tested and concrete has not attained final required
 strength, acceptance will be made in accordance with the Department’s manual
 titled Application of Quality Assurance Specifications for Precast-Prestressed
 Concrete Plants.
 Place recording thermometers as follows: For girders, locate one
 thermometer at the center of gravity of the top flange and one at the center of
 gravity of the bottom flange. For piles, locate the thermometer midway

 807.04.7.3 Accuracy of Forming and Location: Poor matching
 of holes and holes that are not perpendicular to the component will be rejected.
 1. Subsize Holes: Accurately locate holes such that after assembly, and
 before any reaming is done, a cylindrical pin with diameter 1/8 inch smaller
 than the nominal size of the hole may be entered perpendicular to the face of
 the member, without drifting, in at least 75 percent of the contiguous holes in
 the same plane. Failure of a hole to pass a pin with diameter 3/16 inch smaller
 than the nominal size of the hole will be cause for rejection.
 2. Full-Size Holes: Accurately locate holes such that after assembly
 85 percent of the holes in any contiguous group show no offset greater than
 1/32 inch between adjacent thicknesses of metal.
 807.04.8 Shop Assembly: Use Full or Progressive Assembly methods
 unless otherwise specified.
 Place milled-to-bear ends of members in full bearing prior to drilling or
 reaming holes for connection.
 When full-size holes are formed prior to assembly, assemble components,
 and verify and document that assemblies conform to plans and shop drawings,
 including camber, alignment, accuracy of holes, and fit of milled joints.
 When holes are to be formed or finalized in assembled components,
 assemble components, and verify and document that assemblies conform to
 plans and shop drawings, including camber, alignment, accuracy of holes, and
 fit of milled joints prior to finalizing holes.
 Submit documentation verifying assembly conformance to the Fabrication
 Engineer for review. Upon acceptance the assembly may be dismantled.

 807.05.1.2 Turned Bolts: Turned bolts shall be in accordance with
 Section 821.07.12 for mechanical applications. For other applications, turned
 bolts shall be in accordance with the following unless otherwise specified.
 Provide single self-locking nuts or double nuts.
 The surface of the body of turned bolts shall meet the ANSI B 46.1
 roughness rating value of 125  inch. Heads and nuts shall be hexagonal with
 standard dimensions for bolts of the specified nominal size or the next larger
 nominal size. Diameter of threads shall be equal to the body of the bolt or the
 nominal diameter of the bolt. Carefully ream holes for turned bolts and furnish
 specified bolts to provide for a light driving fit. Threads shall be entirely
 outside of holes. Provide a washer under the nut.
 807.05.1.3 Ribbed Bolts: Ribbed bolts shall be unfinished and
 comply with ASTM A307, Grade A.
 Provide single self-locking nuts or double nuts.
 The body of ribbed bolts shall be an approved form with continuous
 longitudinal ribs. The diameter of the body measured on a circle through the
 
 662
 
 points of the ribs shall be 5/64 inch greater than the nominal diameter of the
 specified bolt.

 shall be hexagonal and either recessed or with a washer of suitable thickness.
 Ribbed bolts shall make a driving fit with the holes. Hardness of the ribs shall
 be such that the ribs do not permit the bolts to turn in the holes during
 tightening. If the bolt twists before drawing tight, carefully ream the hole and
 use an oversized bolt.
 807.05.2 Bolted Connections: A fastener or fastener assembly is
 composed of bolt, nut, washers, and, if applicable, a direct tension indicator
 (DTI) device. Use new and unused fastener assemblies in installation and
 testing.
 807.05.2.1 Rotational Capacity Testing: Rotational capacity tests
 are required and shall be performed on all Type 1, Type 3, and galvanized
 (after galvanizing) fastener assemblies by the manufacturer or distributor prior
 to shipping and by the contractor at the jobsite prior to installation. For
 installations utilizing DTIs, the requirement for rotational capacity testing by
 the contractor at the job site is dependent on results obtained during DTI
 Pre-Installation Verification.
 Perform Rotational Capacity Test as specified herein. Test all combinations
 of bolt production lot, nut lot, and flat hardened washer lot used as an assembly
 representative of the surface and lubrication condition at time of installation.
 Do not use DTIs in the test assemblies. Flat hardened washers are required as
 part of the test even if not required as part of the installation fastener assembly.
 Assign a rotational capacity lot number to each combination of lots tested.
 The minimum frequency of testing shall be two fastener assemblies per
 rotational capacity lot. Fastener assembly components shall be new and
 unused prior to testing and discarded after testing.
 Use a dial type torque wrench. No multipliers will be allowed.
 Install fasteners such that 3 to 5 full threads of the bolt are located between
 the bearing surfaces of the bolt head and nut. Restrain the bolt head from
 turning during nut rotation.
 Test fastener assemblies in a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or an acceptable
 equivalent tension measuring device using Method 1. For fastener assemblies
 too short to be tested in a tension measuring device, use Method 2.
 Minimum Required Tension (MRT) used for testing fastener assemblies is
 provided in Table 807-5 and is based on 70 percent of the specified minimum
 strength of bolts.
 
 663

 Where:
 
 P = 115 percent of MRT, pound (refer to Table 807-5)
 D = bolt diameter, feet
 
 807.05.2.1.3 Acceptance Criteria: The fastener assembly will
 be considered non-conforming if any of the following occur:
 1. Inability to install the assembly to the nut rotation in Method 1 or 2 as
 applicable.
 2. Exceeding the torque limit in Method 1 or 2 as applicable.
 3. Inability to meet tension requirement in Method 1.
 665
 
 4. Inability to remove the nut after reaching the Test Rotation.
 5. Shear failure of bolt or nut threads as determined by visual examination
 following removal.
 6. Torsional or torsional/tension failure of the bolt. Expect elongation of
 the bolt in the threads between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head at
 Test Rotation; do not classify such elongation as a failure.
 807.05.2.2 Submittals: Prior to final installation, submit for record
 the following to the Project Engineer:
 1. Mill Test Report for all mill steel used in the manufacture of the bolts,
 nuts, washers, and DTI devices. Reports shall include the place where the
 material was melted and manufactured.
 2. Manufacturer’s Report providing the following:
 a. Lot number of each item tested
 b. Rotational capacity lot number
 c. Rotational capacity tests results
 d. Certification that all items are in compliance with project and ASTM
 specifications
 e. Location of manufacture of fastener assembly components
 3. Coating Report containing the type, thickness, location of application,
 and compliance with the appropriate specifications
 4. Installer’s Report providing the following:
 a. Lot number of each item tested
 b. Rotational capacity lot number
 c. Rotational capacity tests results
 d. Installation Test in accordance with 807.05.2.5.
 807.05.2.3 Shipping Fasteners: Permanently mark all containers
 with the manufacturer lot number and the rotational capacity lot number such
 that identification will be possible at any stage prior to installation.
 807.05.2.4 Bolted Parts: Surfaces of bolted parts in contact with
 the bolt head or nut shall not have a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to bolt axis. Bolted parts shall fit solidly together when
 assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or other compressible
 material.
 Clean and prepare faying surfaces as follows:
 1. When steel is specified to be painted, apply SSPC-SP10 Near-White
 Blast Cleaning and apply an inorganic zinc primer all in accordance with
 Section 811. Provide a Class B slip coefficient of 0.50 minimum.
 
 666
 
 2. When steel is specified to be unpainted, apply SSPC-SP6 Commercial
 Blast Clean in accordance with Section 811. Provide a Class B slip coefficient
 of 0.50 minimum.
 3. When galvanized steel is specified, after galvanizing and prior to
 assembly, abrade contact surfaces within joints by wire brushing or light
 blasting. Provide a Class C slip coefficient of 0.33 minimum. Do not produce
 a break or discontinuity in the zinc surface. Wire brushing shall be a light
 application of manual brushing that marks or scores the surface but removes
 relatively little of the zinc coating. Blasting shall be a light brush-off treatment
 which will produce a dull gray appearance. ASTM A490 bolts shall not be
 galvanized. When ASTM A490 bolts are specified to connect galvanized
 parts, bolts shall be painted to prevent electrolytic action.
 4. When metallic thermal spray coatings are specified, conform to
 811.06.6.2.
 807.05.2.5 Installation and Inspection: Use Direct Tension
 Indicator Method, in accordance with 807.05.2.5.1, unless otherwise
 authorized in writing by the Bridge Engineer.
 Install fastener assemblies of the size and quality specified in properly
 aligned holes. Install a hardened washer directly under nut or bolt head,
 whichever is the element turned in tightening. Use two hardened washers with
 ASTM A490 bolts.
 A flat washer may be used when the abutment surface adjacent to the bolt
 head or nut does not have a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane
 normal to bolt axis. If an outer face of the bolted part has a slope of more than
 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, use a smooth beveled
 washer to compensate for lack of parallelism.
 Do not reuse or re-torque ASTM A325 or ASTM A490 bolts. Retightening
 previously tightened bolts which have been loosened by tightening adjacent
 bolts will not be considered as reuse or re-torque.
 Protect fasteners from dirt and moisture at the jobsite. Reject fasteners
 contaminated with dirt and moisture. Only take as many fasteners as are
 anticipated to be installed and tightened during a work shift from protected
 storage. Return unused fasteners to protected storage at the end of the shift.
 Do not clean fasteners of lubricant that is present in as-delivered condition.
 Provide a tension measuring device at all jobsites when high strength bolts
 are being installed and tensioned. Use the device to perform testing, validate
 installation procedures, train installers, and calibrate wrenches.
 
 667
 
 Impact wrenches, if used, shall be of adequate capacity and sufficiently
 supplied with air to perform the required tensioning of each bolt in
 approximately 10 seconds.
 Minimum Required Tension (MRT) for fasteners is provided in
 Table 807-7 and is based on 70 percent of the specified minimum strength of
 bolts. All tests shall demonstrate that the tension measuring device indicates a
 tension not less than 105 percent of MRT.
 Before installation of fasteners in the work, the engineer will inspect the
 marking, surface condition, and storage of bolts, nuts, washers, DTIs, and the
 faying surfaces of joints for compliance with the specifications.
 The engineer will inspect testing procedures and/or calibration to confirm
 that the selected procedure is properly used, the fastener assemblies match
 those to be used on the project, and the specified tensions are provided. The
 engineer will inspect the installation of fasteners in the work to assure that the
 specified tensions are provided and that the selected procedure is routinely
 properly applied.

 807.05.2.5.1 Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) Method: Do not
 allow the turning element to be in contact with the DTI. Give special attention
 to proper installation of flat hardened washers when DTIs are used with bolts
 installed in oversize or slotted holes.
 Use a 0.005 inch tapered feeler gauge for measuring DTI compression in
 the spaces between the DTI protrusions. A feeler gauge refusal is defined as
 the inability to touch the bolt shank with the feeler gauge.
 1. DTI Method Pre-installation Verification:
 Use a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or equivalent tension measuring
 device. Use a special flat insert in place of a bolt head holding insert to
 provide a DTI bearing surface. Perform at least three field verification tests as
 669
 
 specified herein. A fastener assembly verification lot consists of each
 combination of bolt production lot, nut lot, washer lot, DTI lot, and DTI
 position relative to the turned element (bolt head or nut) to be used on the
 project. Test each fastener assembly verification lot with DTIs and flat
 hardened washers arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned.
 Restrain the element intended to be stationary (bolt head or nut) from rotation.
 Assign a verification lot number to each fastener assembly verification lot
 tested.
 Use rigid spacers if required so that at least three and preferably no more
 than five threads are located between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt
 head. If the bolt is too short to be tested in the tension measuring device, use a
 similar bolt of adequate length in place of the short bolt.
 Tension the fastener to a verification tension of 105 percent of MRT in
 accordance with Table 807-7. If an impact wrench is used, the tension
 developed using the impact wrench shall be no more than two-thirds of the
 verification tension. Use a manual wrench to complete tensioning. Record the
 number of refusals of a 0.005 inch feeler gauge in the spaces between the DTI
 protrusions. Reject the DTI lot if the number of refusals for any DTI tested
 exceeds the Maximum Number of Refusals shown in Table 807-8.
 Further tension the fastener until a 0.005 inch feeler gauge is refused in all
 DTI spaces and a visible gap exists in at least one space between the
 protrusions. Record tension at this condition and remove fastener assembly
 from the tension measuring device.
 For production bolts too short to be tested in the tension measuring device,
 additionally assemble the short fastener assembly with an unused DTI from the
 same lot in a connection of steel plates of equivalent thickness to the work and
 tension short fastener until a 0.005 inch feeler gauge is refused in all DTI
 spaces and a visible gap exists in at least one space between the protrusions.
 Remove short fastener assembly.
 The fastener assembly verification lot is accepted if none of the following
 occur.
 1. Inability to compress DTI protrusions to have a 0.005 inch feeler gauge
 refused in all DTI spaces and a visible gap existing in at least one space
 between the protrusions.
 2. Inability to remove the nut when removing the production fastener
 assembly from the tension measuring device or from the steel plate
 connection.
 3. Shear failure of threads in production bolt or nut as determined by
 visual examination following removal.
 670
 
 4. Torsional or torsional/tension failure of the production bolt. Elongation
 of the bolt in the threads between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt
 head is acceptable.
 For an unaccepted fastener assembly verification lot, perform field
 Rotational Capacity Test in accordance with 807.05.2.1 to determine
 acceptance of the bolt, nut and hardened washer lot.
 Accept the DTI lot if the recorded tension during the DTI pre-installation
 verification method at one visible gap is less than 95 percent of the average
 tension recorded at Test Rotation in the field Rotational Capacity Test.

 2. DTI Method Installation:
 Install fasteners in all holes of the connection and bring to snug condition.
 Snug condition is defined as the fastener tension that exists when all joint
 material plies are in firm contact and DTI protrusions are partially compressed
 with a visible gap greater than 0.005 inch in all spaces. If a DTI exhibits a
 refusal of the 0.005 inch feeler gauge, remove the fastener, install a new
 unused DTI, and bring the fastener to snug condition.
 Further tension all fasteners, progressing systematically from the most rigid
 part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize
 relaxation of previously tensioned fasteners. Proper tensioning of fasteners
 may require more than a single cycle of systematic partial tensioning prior to
 final tensioning. Final tensioning is defined as compression of the DTI
 protrusions resulting in having the minimum number of refusals in accordance
 with Table 807-9 and having at least one visible gap. If a DTI does not
 conform to these specifications, remove the fastener assembly, install a new
 fastener assembly, and bring the fastener to specified final tensioning.
 3. DTI Method Inspection:
 Visually inspect all DTIs in the connection to verify protrusions are
 deformed to approximate final position and that a visible gap remains. If a DTI
 exhibits no visible gap, remove the fastener assembly, install a new fastener
 assembly, and bring the fastener to specified final tensioning.
 Use the specified 0.005 inch feeler gauge on at least 10 percent of the
 fasteners in a connection, but not less than two fasteners, and verify that the
 number of refusals conforms to Table 807-9. If the number of refusals on any
 inspected DTI does not conform to Table 807-9, all DTIs in the connection
 will be inspected with the 0.005 inch feeler gauge, and any fasteners not
 sufficiently tensioned shall be further tensioned and re-inspected for visible
 gap and number of refusals of the 0.005 inch feeler gauge.
 If all inspected DTIs conform to the specifications, the connection will be
 accepted. Should inspection reveal excessive tension (no visible gap) or
 inadequate tension (less than minimum required refusals of the 0.005 inch
 feeler gauge), adjust installation procedures to meet specifications.

 807.05.2.5.2 Turn-of-Nut Method:
 1. Turn-of-Nut Method Pre-installation Verification:
 Test a representative sample of not less than three fastener assemblies for
 each bolt diameter, length, type, and grade used in the work using a tension
 measuring device. The test assembly shall include flat hardened washers
 arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned. Demonstrate in all
 tests that the method for estimating the snug condition and controlling the turns
 from snug condition given in Table 807-10 develops a tension not less than
 105 percent of MRT in Table 807-7. Follow the tension measuring device
 procedures for fastener assembly installation during testing.
 
 673
 
 2. Turn-of-Nut Method Installation:
 Install fasteners in all holes of the connection and bring to snug condition.
 Snug condition is defined as the fastener tension that exists when all joint
 material plies are in firm contact. This may be attained by a few impacts of an
 impact wrench or the full effort of a worker using an ordinary spud wrench.
 Temporarily match mark bolt, nut, and bolted part. Tension all fasteners
 progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the
 free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tensioned
 fasteners in accordance with the rotations specified in Table 807-10.
 The rotations specified in Table 807-10 are relative to the bolt, regardless of
 the element (nut or bolt) being turned. The rotations specified are applicable
 only to connections in which all material within the grip of the bolt is steel.
 For fasteners installed by 1/2 turn and less, tolerance for the specified
 rotation is minus 0 degrees, plus 30 degrees. For fasteners installed by 2/3 turn
 and more, tolerance for the specified rotation is minus 0 degrees, plus
 45 degrees.
 When bolt length exceeds 12 bolt diameters, determine required rotation by
 testing in a suitable tension device simulating actual conditions.

 3. Turn-of-Nut Method Inspection:
 Calibrate a manual job inspection torque wrench in a tension measuring
 device. Install five fastener assemblies of each bolt diameter, length, type, and
 grade to be used in the work in the tension measuring device and tension to
 674
 
 10 percent of MRT shown in Table 807-7. Further tension the fastener
 assemblies to MRT with the job inspection torque wrench and record the
 respective torque value. For the five torque values corresponding to MRT,
 discard the low and high values and average the remaining three values to
 determine the Job Inspection Torque.
 Inspect fasteners by applying the job inspection torque wrench to at least
 10 percent of the fasteners, but not less than two fasteners, selected by the
 engineer at random in each connection. If no bolt or nut is turned by
 application of the Job Inspection Torque, the connection will be accepted as
 properly tensioned. If a bolt or nut is turned by the application of less than the
 Job Inspection Torque, either apply the Job Inspection Torque to all fasteners
 in the connection, or re-tension all fasteners in the connection using the
 original installation method and in accordance with the specified tension.
 Repeat the inspection process until the connection is accepted.
 807.05.2.5.3 Calibrated Wrench Method:
 Only use Calibrated Wrench Tightening when required by the plans or
 directed by the engineer. This specification does not recognize standard
 torques determined from tables or from formulas, which are assumed to relate
 torque to tension.
 1. Calibrated Wrench Method Pre-Installation Verification:
 Set wrenches to provide a tension not less than 105 percent of and not
 greater than 110 percent of MRT in Table 807-7. Calibrate the installation
 procedures at least once each working day for each bolt diameter, length, and
 grade using the following:
 a. The length of air hose that will be used during installation and the
 fastener assemblies that are being installed in the work.
 b. Accomplish calibration in a tension measuring device capable of
 indicating bolt tension. Tension three fasteners of the diameter, length, type,
 grade and washer orientation as those being installed in the work.
 c. Recalibrate wrenches when significant differences are noted in the
 surface condition of the bolts, nuts, bolt/nut threads, or washers.
 2. Calibrated Wrench Method Installation:
 Install fasteners in all holes of the connection and bring to snug condition.
 Snug condition is defined as the fastener tension that exists when all joint
 material plies are in firm contact. This may be attained by a few impacts of an
 impact wrench or the full effort of a worker using an ordinary spud wrench.
 Further tension the connection using the calibrated wrench. Tension all
 fasteners, progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection
 to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously
 675
 
 tightened fasteners. Return the wrench to touch up previously tensioned
 fasteners which may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tensioning
 of adjacent fasteners until all fasteners are tensioned to the specified value.
 3. Calibrated Wrench Method Inspection:
 Perform Calibrated Wrench Method Inspection in accordance with Turn-ofNut Method Inspection of 807.05.2.5.2.
 807.05.3 Falsework: Design falsework in accordance with Section 817.
 807.05.4 Straightening Bent Material: Submit for review and
 acceptance; repair procedures for corrective action. Straighten plates, angles,
 other shapes and built-up members using methods that will not produce
 fracture or other damage. Straighten distorted members by mechanical means
 or by supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat. In no case
 shall the temperature of the steel exceed 1100°F (590°C).
 Following the corrective action, carefully inspect the surface of the metal
 for evidence of fracture or other damage.
 807.05.5 Installing Pin Connections: Use pilot and driving nuts to
 install pins when required at no additional cost to the Department. Drive pins
 so that members will be in full bearing with the pins. Tighten pin nuts and
 burr threads at face of nut to restrain nut.
 807.05.6 Field Welding: Field welding is not allowed on structures
 unless specifically shown on the plans. When shown, comply with
 Section 809.
 807.05.7 Misfits: Correction of minor misfits may be expected. Minor
 reaming will be considered a legitimate part of erection. Use a reaming tool no
 larger than the bolt hole diameter. Ream no more than 5 percent of the holes in
 the connection.
 Immediately report any error in fabrication or deformation which prevents
 proper assembly and fitting of parts. Submit corrective measures to the
 engineer for review and acceptance. Make all corrections in the presence of the
 Department’s inspector. All corrections and replacements shall be at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 807.05.8 Field Painting: Comply with Section 811.

 three random tape samples in the first 1000 square feet of surface area and one
 additional random tape sample for each subsequent 1000 square feet of surface
 area in a work area. A work area will be defined as the area cleaned during the
 same shift using the same blast equipment and abrasive, represented by all the
 
 706
 
 samples taken in that area. Any changes made to personnel, blast equipment,
 or abrasive will result in establishing a new work area.
 On the first day of abrasive blasting operation, blast two metal panels to the
 specifications. The metal panels shall be ASTM A709 Grade 36 and measure
 0.25 inch by 8.5 inch by 11 inch, which the contractor and engineer shall date
 and initial. Coat one panel with a clear, non-yellowing finish as a visual
 example and use the uncoated panel to calibrate the dry film thickness gauges
 used on the project. Wrap panels in corrosion inhibitive paper and keep in a
 clean, dry area. Use panels as a comparison standard throughout the project.
 Upon initiation of abrasive blasting operation on structures containing pack
 rust areas, blast clean to an acceptable level at least one representative area of
 pack rust selected by the Project Engineer that is easily accessed. Coat the area
 with a clear, non-yellowing finish. Use as a visual comparison standard
 throughout the project.
 On the first day of abrasive blasting operation, blast the structure for no
 more than 15 minutes, blow down the prepared surface, and perform three
 surface profile tape tests in the presence of the QA inspector. If the average
 surface profile does not fall within specifications, adjust means and methods
 (grit size, pressure, standoff distance, nozzle angle, etc.). Perform further 15minute maximum blasting, cleaning, and testing until the surface profile is
 within specifications, at which time the contractor will be allowed to proceed
 with full production blast cleaning. Rework any area that does not meet
 specifications until it meets the requirements of the contract.
 Schedule cleaning and painting so surfaces to be coated are completely free
 of any contaminant prior to coating. Remove all abrasive, dust, and paint
 residue from steel surfaces and any scaffolding, staging, or support steel above
 the area with a commercial grade HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner equipped with
 a brush type cleaning tool, or by double blowing. If using the double blowing
 method, complete all blow-down operations within the contained area and then
 vacuum all exposed top surfaces of structural steel (flanges, longitudinal
 stiffeners, splice plates, hangers, etc.). Test all horizontal prepared surfaces for
 cleanliness prior to coating by simply wiping the surface with a finger; any
 accumulation requires re-cleaning. If prime coat is not applied within
 eight hours after the surface has been approved for coating application, the
 surface will require an additional QA inspection.
 The QC Inspector shall verify compliance with applicable specifications
 and conduct required testing prior to notifying the Project Engineer that work
 area surfaces are ready for primer application.
 
 707
 
 The QA Inspector will conduct surface profile readings in accordance with
 ASTM D4417 Method C and the contract. The work area will be divided up
 and tape readings will be taken. All cleaned structural members in the work
 area shall be represented in the random sampling (truss post, chord, and
 diagonals, beam flanges and webs, diaphragms, cross-frames, etc.). If the
 averages of all the QA readings fall within contract specification, the area is
 compliant and may be primed. If the average of all the QA readings falls
 outside of the contract limits and the cause is from more than one sample
 location, the work area is non-compliant and cannot be primed. If the average
 of all the QA readings falls outside of the contract limits and the cause can be
 attributed to one location, then the QC Inspector will be notified of the noncompliant work, will be requested to accompany the QA Inspector on a second
 sampling of the identified area, and will witness the sampling. The secondary
 sampling will consist of three individual tape readings taken at the initial outof-compliant location within a 1-square-foot area. Substitute the average of
 the three secondary readings for the initial out-of-compliant location sample in
 calculating a new overall average of the work area. If the new average for the
 work area falls within the contract requirements, the area is compliant and may
 be primed. If the new average does not fall within the contract requirements,
 the work area is non-compliant and shall not be primed. Re-work and re-test
 all work areas that are non-compliant until they fall within specifications.
 Primer applied to non-compliant work areas will result in reporting the
 activity to the QCS, notifying the Project Engineer, documenting in the DIR,
 and reworking of the area until surface is compliant.
 Perform abrasive blast cleaning within a containment system and confine
 all particulates.
 811.06.5 Application: Apply a complete coating system to all metal
 surfaces specified to be coated. Apply coatings in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations, SSPC-PA1 Paint Application Specification
 No. 1 and the contract.
 Prior to the application of prime coat, inspect the substrate for
 contamination and defects, and prepare the surface in accordance
 with 811.06.4. For new steel, the Department’s Fabrication Inspector will
 perform the QA required at the shop. For existing steel, provide the Project
 Engineer with passing QC documentation for cleanliness and surface profile.
 Permit the Project Engineer to inspect the substrate to verify proper cleanliness
 and surface profile. Apply prime coat after acceptance of the surface
 preparation by the Project Engineer.
 
 708
 
 Prior to the application of each subsequent coat, inspect the coating for
 contamination and defects. Provide the Project Engineer with passing QC
 documentation, including DFT readings conforming to SSPC-PA2. Permit the
 Project Engineer to inspect the coating and verify proper surface preparation
 and dry film thickness. Apply subsequent coat after acceptance of the previous
 coat by the Project Engineer.
 Application of coats without the Project Engineer’s acceptance of the
 underlying surface or previous coat will be considered non-compliant work.
 Apply each coat, including a stripe coat, in a color that contrasts with the
 substrate or preceding coat.
 Provide a finished surface free from foreign contaminants, grease, stains,
 dry spray, overspray, runs, sags, drips, excessive paint build up, ridges, waves,
 laps, streaks, brush marks, blisters, bubbles, craters, mud cracking, holidays,
 and variations in color, texture, and finish (glossy or dull). Apply coating so
 each coat has complete coverage (including corners and crevices), has a film of
 uniform thickness, and bonds to the underlying surface.
 811.06.5.1 Paint Systems for New Steel and Cleaned
 Existing Steel: Apply each coat of paint with airless or conventional spray
 equipment in a fine, even spray. If thinning of paint is allowed, thin in
 accordance with the paint manufacturer’s recommendations, but in no case

 coat of paint has dried.
 • Daily air movement measurements inside containment before blasting
 for field operations. Acceptance criteria per ventilation requirements in
 the plan notes and accepted contractor containment plan.
 • Wind speed and direction daily every 2 hours. Take readings near
 members being coated.
 • For the initial section of work, inspections by the Project Engineer,
 contractor, and lead coating inspector will take place for each phase
 described in 811.05.12 upon completion of each respective phase.
 Request in writing to the Project Engineer to schedule these inspections.
 811.06.5.3 Weather and Temperature Limitations: Do not
 spray coatings when the measured wind speed in the immediate coating area is
 above 15 miles per hour. Do not apply coatings when contamination from
 rainfall is imminent or when the ambient air temperature, relative humidity,
 dew point temperature, or temperature of the steel is outside limits provided on
 the coating manufacturer’s product data sheet and these specifications.
 Protect the cleaning and painting area of the structure from environmental
 conditions during and after the coatings application. Rework any coating
 which has been adversely affected by the environmental conditions.
 If utilizing fans, heaters, ventilators, or other equipment to achieve
 acceptable environmental conditions for coating applications, maintain those
 conditions until coating reaches a dry-to-touch condition and as recommended
 by the coatings manufacturer. Provide a time lapse recording instrument for
 monitoring all controlled conditions during this period.
 During application, coatings shall be between 40°F and 100°F and
 according to the manufacturer. Do not apply paint unless the surface
 temperature of the metal is at least 45°F and rising, and not in excess of 120°F
 and according to the manufacturer.
 710
 
 Do not apply coatings to wet or damp surfaces, during rain, snow, fog, or
 misty conditions, or when the steel surface temperature is less than 5°F above
 the dew point.
 Do not apply coatings when the relative humidity exceeds 85 percent and
 according to the manufacturer. Maintain temperature and humidity limits from
 before commencement of painting to the time of dry-to-touch.
 811.06.5.4 Penetrating Sealer: If required by the plans, apply to
 all locations where irremovable crevice corrosion remains after all surface
 preparation best efforts have been made, as determined by the Project
 Engineer. Apply penetrating sealer to crevice corrosion and allow curing in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation prior to applying
 subsequent coatings.
 811.06.5.5 Stripe Coat: Stripe coat is a separate coat and operation,
 and is applied to welds, corners, edges, crevices, seams, fastener assemblies,
 and rough or pitted surfaces.
 For shop applied primer, apply stripe coat in the field after erection.
 For existing steel, apply coatings and penetrating sealer in the following
 sequence.
 Apply full prime coat to all areas except where penetrating sealer will be
 applied.
 Apply penetrating sealer.
 Apply stripe coat.
 Extend stripe coat a minimum of 1-inch beyond the edge, seam, fastener
 assembly, etc. In general, use brush or dauber to apply stripe coat and work
 into crevices and uncoated areas. For continuous uninterrupted edges (not
 lattice or built-up members), apply stripe coat by spray or rollers.
 Stripe coating procedures are subject to acceptance by the Project
 Engineer.
 811.06.5.6 Caulking: For painted steel, apply caulk between
 applications of intermediate coat and top coat. When a two coat paint system is
 used, caulk between application of primer coat and top coat. For unpainted
 weathering steel, field clean surfaces to receive caulk and apply caulk as soon
 as possible after cleaning. Prepare surfaces and apply caulking in accordance
 with caulk manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Use caulk to seal the perimeter of all faying surfaces, cracks, crevices,
 joints, gaps less than 1/2 inch, and skip-welded joints. For gaps 1/2 inch or
 greater, treat in accordance with the plans. Apply caulking bead with a smooth
 uniform finish and cure according to the caulk manufacturer’s
 recommendations.
 711
 
 811.06.5.7 Protection of Surfaces: Protect surfaces and working
 mechanisms not intended to be coated during application of coatings. Clean
 surfaces that have been contaminated with coatings or other substances until all
 traces of the coating or substance have been removed. If contaminated
 surfaces were lubricated, solvent clean to remove contaminants and lubricant,
 and re-lubricate as directed by the Project Engineer. Do not allow material
 from cleaning and coating operations to be dispersed outside the intended work
 area. Remove and repair, to the satisfaction of the Department as a condition
 of Final Acceptance, all contamination, scratches, marks, stains, and other
 effects to the work introduced by cleaning and painting, including the
 installation and removal of temporary works, which are deemed unacceptable
 by the Department.

 stripe coats, or when otherwise approved by the Project Engineer. Adjust
 spray equipment to produce an even, wet coat with minimum overspray.
 Apply coatings in even, parallel passes, overlapping 50 percent. Agitate
 coatings during application as required by the coating manufacturer’s product
 data sheet to provide uniform consistency.
 Touch up missed or damaged locations after a coat dries and before
 applying succeeding coats.
 Strictly abide by the manufacturer's specified recoat period. Apply no paint
 until the preceding coat has met the recoat criteria and has been both tested and
 accepted by the Project Engineer. Where conditions require recoat after the
 specified recoat period, employ the manufacturer’s recommended remedial
 procedures. Any coating removed during this process shall be replaced prior
 to applying additional coats. Protect adjacent surfaces already properly coated.
 811.06.5.10 Thickness and Completeness of Coats: Apply
 coatings to the DFT as identified in the AML for the paint system selected and
 at least the number of coats specified. When required, apply penetrating sealer
 to the amount specified by the manufacturer and accepted by the Project
 Engineer.
 
 712
 
 After application of each coat, thoroughly inspect the surfaces for
 completeness of coat and measure the DFT in accordance with SSPC-PA2.
 When the DFT does not meet specifications, repair in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Retest the repaired areas and remediate as
 required to the satisfaction of the Project Engineer.
 811.06.5.11 Coating, Drying, and Curing: Apply coatings within
 the time specified by the coating manufacturer’s product data sheet for drying
 and recoating.
 Before handling the coated member, test for cure in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommended method.
 811.06.5.12 Coating Finish:
 Protect the surface from
 contamination and disfigurement by construction activities. All marred painted
 surfaces are considered damaged areas and require repair.

 environmental regulation or when failure to properly execute any pollution
 control provisions occurs. Resume operations after written proposed
 
 717
 
 corrective procedures have been submitted to and approved by the Project
 Engineer and implemented.
 811.09.3 Permits: Seek permit determination from regulatory agencies
 to avoid any potential permit non-compliance issues during work activities.
 811.09.4 Ambient Air Quality Compliance and Protection of the
 Air:
 811.09.4.1 Visible Emissions: Assess the visible emissions using
 EPA Method 22, Timing of Emissions as defined by 40 CFR § 60, Appendix A,
 Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources. During abrasive
 blasting, do not allow visible emissions from a containment to exceed a
 random cumulative duration of more than one percent of the work day (SSPC
 Guide 6, Level 1 Emissions). A work day shall be defined for purposes of
 visible emission assessment as an 8-hour day. This amounts to a cumulative
 emission duration limit of 4.8 minutes per work day. Emissions occurring in
 any one hour of any work day that cumulatively exceeds 36 seconds shall be
 cause for immediate suspension of cleaning work and modification or
 adjustment of the containment system to eliminate the source of emissions
 prior to resuming cleaning operations.
 For quality assurance, visible assessments will be conducted by an
 independent third party environmental testing firm under separate contract with
 the Department. These visible assessments of emissions may be used to
 indicate the need for immediate changes in containment or work practice.
 During pressurized water cleaning, do not allow visible emissions from a
 containment to exceed a random cumulative duration of more than 10 percent
 of the work day (SSPC Guide 6, Level 3 Emissions).
 811.09.4.2 Visual Accumulation: Conduct all activities so that
 paint, solvents, fuel, waste, abrasives, dust, lead contaminated materials,
 debris, etc. are not released or spilled onto the pavement, soil, water, sediment,
 or into the air or storm sewers.
 Visual accumulation on the bridge deck, ground, or any other surface
 outside the constructed containment, as determined by the Project Engineer,
 shall result in the immediate suspension of the emission generating activities.
 Determine the source of the emissions and perform corrective measures to
 prevent further emissions. Clean up all visual accumulations by vacuuming or
 other appropriate methods and contain and store emitted materials to the
 satisfaction of the Project Engineer. Delays due to deficient work will be at no
 additional time or cost to the Department.
 
 718
 
 811.09.4.3 Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) Matter
 Control emissions from the containment area to prevent exceeding the TSP
 Lead Level of 1.5 μg per cubic meter over a 24-hour period.
 811.09.4.4 Penalty for Exceeding TSP Lead: An independent
 third party environmental testing firm under separate contract with the
 Department will conduct TSP Lead monitoring in accordance with 40 CFR §
 50, Appendix B, Reference Method for Determination of TSP Matter in the
 Atmosphere (high volume sampler required), and 40 CFR § 50, Appendix G,
 Reference Method for Determination of TSP Matter Collected from Ambient
 Air and position the TSP Lead monitoring equipment in general accordance
 with 40 CFR § 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. The Department
 reserves the right to place TSP monitors anywhere within the project limits,
 including the regulated area.
 Whether or not a penalty may be assessed under the provisions below, the
 Department shall have the authority to suspend and shall suspend all cleaning
 operations whenever air sampling results taken at any location around the work
 site indicate that TSP Lead emissions have exceeded the specified limit defined
 in 811.09.4.3. The Department will provide the contractor with written notice
 of suspension and all cleaning operations shall be suspended until corrections
 are made to the containment or work procedures are modified to comply with
 these requirements.
 The Department will monitor and review the TSP Lead sample results. The
 first set of sample results that exceed the limit will set the penalty date. The
 Department will not assess the penalty for all sample results on and previous to
 the penalty date. The Department shall assess the penalty for all sample results
 that exceed the limit after the penalty date.
 The Department shall deduct from the next payment to the contractor for
 the amount earned, a penalty in the amount of $1,500 for each 24-hour period,
 subsequent to the penalty date, in which one or more TSP monitors indicates
 that lead emissions exceeded the limit. The contractor shall be liable for this
 penalty on the basis of the aforementioned sample results, whether or not the
 Department has sustained any loss or damage, and whether or not the
 Department has incurred any cost as a result of lead emissions in excess of the
 limit. In addition, the contractor shall reimburse the Department for any
 penalties or fees assessed against it arising from such occurrences. The
 contractor waives any and all right to contest the sample results and any right
 to contest an adjustment of the contract price in the amount of any penalties or
 fees on the grounds that lead emissions in excess of the limit did not cause
 injury or harm to the Department or to third persons.
 719
 
 Upon the Department receiving the third TSP failing report after the penalty
 date, the contractor will be required to suspend all cleaning operations,
 examine the entire operation to determine the cause of the lead emissions in
 excess of the limits, determine appropriate corrective measures, revise, and
 resubmit the previously accepted submittals to reflect the corrective measures
 to the engineer for review, then take the appropriate steps before resuming
 production.
 In the event that work is suspended for corrective measures in accordance
 with the previous paragraphs TSP Lead monitoring, Contract Time will not be
 suspended.
 811.09.4.5 Regulated Areas: Establish regulated areas around the
 work site to prohibit entry of unauthorized persons. Clearly mark the regulated
 area by the use of warning signs, rope, barrier tape, or temporary construction
 fencing.
 Conduct monitoring in accordance with the NIOSH procedures upon
 initiation of dust producing operations.
 811.09.4.6 Soil/Ground Quality: Submit a drawing showing the
 locations of the regulated areas, sensitive receptors, and storage and transfer
 areas to the Project Engineer for record and stake out these areas on the ground
 so the soil sampling can be performed.
 Inspect the ground beneath and in proximity to the structure in the presence
 of the Project Engineer and the Environmental Compliance Unit for visible
 paint chips to establish an initial job site cleanliness standard. When heavy
 metals are in the existing coatings, the Department will collect soil samples
 prior to and after construction activities and test for heavy metals. If the
 Department determines that construction activities increased the heavy metal
 content in the soil, return the site to the pre-job levels or as directed at no
 additional cost or time to the Department. Submit proposed remediation
 procedure to the Project Engineer for review prior to initiation of remediation
 work.
 The Department may conduct additional soil sampling and testing as
 necessary to determine the effectiveness of pollution controls, remediation

 sufficient interior clearances for form construction, inspection of form
 exteriors, and to permit control of water.
 Cofferdams that tilt or move laterally shall be righted, reset, and enlarged as
 needed to provide necessary interior clearances.
 751
 
 Control ingress of water so that construction can be performed in the dry.
 Dewater after seal concrete has cured. When weighted cofferdams are
 employed and the weight is utilized to participate in vertical stability of the
 system, provide anchorage to transfer cofferdam system weight to the seal.
 During placing and curing of seal, control the water elevation inside the
 cofferdam to prevent water flow through the seal.

 test listed in Table 818-1. For these tests, extract all test specimens from a fullscale product of the specified size. The results of these tests may be extended
 
 764
 
 through engineering calculations, to a product of another size only if the other
 size has the same or smaller cross section than the tested product.
 Cut test specimens from plastic from the full-scale product, except those
 tests that require the entire cross section of the product to be tested. Test the
 product full-scale in bending, to quantitatively determine the flexural modulus
 of elasticity and the bending yield stress. Scale model tests are not acceptable.
 Use a test configuration which provides three point bending, with the product
 simply supported at two locations, with the load applied equidistant from the
 two supports. Use a supported span to depth ratio of a minimum of 16:1.
 Load the product at least until the specified minimum yield stress is reached.
 During the test, load and record the corresponding deflection data. Measure
 deflection at the load point, and at two other points, each equidistant between
 the supports and the load. Measure deflection at least at 1,000 pound load
 increments.
 Use load and deflection data acquired during the test to calculate the
 stiffness (EI), and the bending stress. The flexural modulus of elasticity is
 calculated by dividing EI by the moment of inertia of the cross section of the
 product. Calculate the properties utilizing standard elastic beam flexure
 formulas. Report the stiffness (EI) as the average of the stiffness at all
 measurement locations, between zero load and half the load corresponding to
 the specification yield stress. The specified minimum yield stress in bending is
 required to be reached before failure of the product. Calculate stress at the

 Project Engineer. At all times, construction must comply with the United
 States Coast Guard (USCG) permit or negotiated agreement with the USCG.
 Maintain marine and vehicular traffic requirements and closures as
 specified in the plans.
 
 775
 
 820.07.2 Survey of Structural Elements: Perform all survey
 measurements of structural bridge elements that may be affected by
 temperature and sunlight in the early morning prior to development of a
 temperature differential in the structure.
 820.07.3 Shop Assembly of Structural Steel: Shop assemble the
 structural steel for all movable spans in accordance with 807.04.10 and mark
 for reassembly in accordance with 807.04.24.
 820.07.4 Construction Sequence: Adhere to construction
 sequencing specified herein unless otherwise specified on the plans. Any
 deviation from the construction sequencing must be submitted to the Bridge
 Engineer for review.
 820.07.5 Concrete Test Blocks: Provide test blocks to determine the
 exact density (weight) of the concrete individually for the movable span deck
 (if applicable), the counterweight, and the balance blocks. All concrete shall be
 Class A unless otherwise noted on the plans. Cast test blocks early enough in
 the construction period such that the test data will be available when it is time
 for the contractor to perform counterweight calculations.
 Casting and weighing test blocks must be performed in the presence of the
 Project Engineer. Notify the Project Engineer at least three working days in
 advance. Test blocks shall be of known volume, and shall contain at least one
 cubic foot (0.03 cu m) of concrete. For each concrete mixture, cast three test
 blocks. Record the exact concrete mixture used, and the weight of the test
 blocks the day they were cast. Continue to record the weight of each test block
 every day for at least seven days. If the weights are still changing after seven
 days, continue to record weights each day until the weights stabilize. Use the
 average weight of each set of three test blocks for the counterweight
 calculations.
 For the movable span deck, select the mixture to be used and record the
 density for future use in the counterweight calculations.
 Balance blocks have been standardized and shall weigh 80 - 85 pounds
 each, with a concrete unit weight of approximately 145 pounds per cubic foot.
 Continue to make test blocks until a mixture with this density is achieved.
 Record mixture for future use in casting balance blocks.
 For the counterweight, concrete density shall not exceed 180 pounds per
 cubic foot. Record mixtures with several known densities for possible use in
 the counterweight.
 820.07.6 Construction of Counterweight:
 1. Counterweight Calculations and Shop Drawings: Counterweight
 dimensions shown on the plans are estimates based on an estimated design
 776
 
 weight of the movable span and an estimated concrete density for both the
 counterweight and the movable span deck. Prior to beginning construction of
 the counterweights, prepare and submit to the Bridge Engineer for review
 calculations and shop drawings that show the proposed construction of the
 counterweight and the proposed concrete density to be used. Calculations shall
 be based on the submitted shop drawings for the movable span structural steel,
 grid deck, concrete deck (including actual concrete density from test blocks),
 concrete reinforcing steel, barrier rails, sidewalks, counterweight wire ropes,
 balance chains, mechanical equipment, electrical equipment, nuts, bolts,
 washers, and any other appurtenances that are part of the movable span.
 Calculations shall show the center of gravity of the movable span and the
 counterweight if needed.
 Maintain the method of construction shown on the plans and plan
 dimensions. In the event that the counterweight must be resized, shape and
 construction of counterweight shall be as similar to the plans as practical. If
 needed, add plate steel or steel billets to the counterweight to increase weight
 with approval of the Bridge Engineer. If used, they shall be uniformly
 distributed throughout the counterweight, individually supported within the
 counterweight, clean and free of oil or grease, and not galvanized or coated
 with other materials. Vertical clearance between the counterweight and the
 roadway shall be not less than 5 feet when the movable span is in the fully
 open position including allowable over-travel. Vertical clearance between the
 counterweight and any other obstruction (barrier rail, hand rail, etc.) shall be
 not less than 2 ½ feet in the fully open position, including allowable overtravel. In calculating minimum clearance, counterweight ropes shall be
 assumed to stretch 2 percent of their calculated length.
 2. Counterweight Pockets: Size counterweight pockets to hold balance
 blocks equal to 15 percent of the weight of the counterweight. Calculations
 shall assume that the counterweight pockets are 1/3 full of balance blocks.
 Any counterweight pocket exposed to rainwater shall have at least two
 drain holes that are at least 6 inches in diameter.
 For vertical lift bridges, size counterweight pockets so that the balance
 blocks do not show above the sides of the pocket.
 For bascule spans with counterweights that rotate with the movable span,
 position counterweight pockets to allow for adjustment of the center of gravity
 of the movable span. Counterweight pockets must securely hold balance blocks
 during operation of the movable span.
 3. Balance Blocks: Fabricate balance blocks as shown on the plans and
 in a uniform manner using Class A concrete with a density of approximately
 777
 
 145 pounds per cubic foot as determined from the test blocks. Balance blocks
 shall weigh between 80 – 85 pounds to facilitate handling by a single worker.
 Weigh at least 10 percent of the balance blocks at random after they have cured
 to their final weight. Discard all balance blocks outside of this range, and
 continue weighing questionable balance blocks to the satisfaction of the
 Project Engineer.
 Construct enough balance blocks to counterbalance the movable span when
 it is fully completed. A complete and balanced counterweight shall have at
 least 1 percent of its weight in balance blocks installed in the counterweight
 pockets, and at least an additional 1/2 percent of its weight in extra balance
 blocks to be stored on site as directed by the Project Engineer for future
 adjustment.

 Alignments shall meet tolerances specified in the Contract, or the
 manufacturer’s minimum requirements, whichever is more stringent.
 820.07.8 Temporary Operation and Maintenance of Movable
 Span: Provide qualified personnel to operate and maintain the movable
 bridge as directed below. All bridge operations shall be in accordance with the
 United States Coast Guard (USCG) permit or negotiated agreement with the
 USCG. While operating the movable bridge, the contractor is responsible for
 maintenance of the structure. In addition to 107.19, damages that are the result
 of either negligent operation or negligent maintenance are the responsibility of
 the contractor.
 1. New Construction: Operate and maintain the movable span until the
 Department agrees to take final acceptance of the project. If the project utilizes
 a movable detour bridge during the construction of a new movable bridge,
 operate and maintain the detour bridge for the duration of the project.
 2. Repair and Rehabilitation Projects: The Department will continue to
 operate and maintain the movable span during construction if the contractor is
 performing work away from the movable span such that neither his personnel
 nor his equipment could be harmed by its operation, and if the work being
 performed in no way affects the operation of the movable span. Once work
 begins on or within the limits of the movable span, or if the work affects the
 operation of the movable span, the contractor shall begin operating and
 maintaining the movable span. The Department’s operator will remain in the
 778
 
 operator’s house during normal operating times, and will continue to monitor
 the marine radio and log marine traffic, however, the contractor will be
 responsible for the actual operation of the movable span. If the work has
 involved the mechanical or electrical systems, or if the work has altered the
 operation of the movable span in any way, the contractor shall continue to
 operate the movable span until final acceptance of the project.
 820.07.9 Final Setup, and Field Testing of Mechanical and

 4. Installation of Bridge Railings, Mechanical Equipment and Balance
 Blocks: Set and complete bridge railings, install all mechanical equipment,
 and add balance blocks to balance the movable span.
 820.08.7 Rack and Pinion Installation (Swing Span): For swing
 span bridges with rack and pinion gears, installation requirements are similar
 to the requirements for vertical lift bridge rack and pinion gears.
 820.08.8 Span Balancing (Swing Span): Perform span balancing in
 the morning when the effects of temperature on the main girders are at a
 minimum. Do not perform span balancing during wind that could cause the
 balance wheels to contact with the track.
 After the movable span is fully constructed, including all mechanical and
 electrical equipment, and deflected under dead load, adjust the balance wheels
 to have a 1/2-to 3/4-inch gap between the balance wheels and the track.
 Check the vertical profile ordinates of both main girders and compare with
 the ordinates shown in the plans for the span swinging freely with equal end
 lifts. Adjust balance blocks, swing the span open and closed, and recheck
 ordinates. Repeat until the ordinates match the ordinates shown on the plans as
 close as achievable. Operate the span multiple times and recheck ordinates to
 ensure the results are repeatable.
 Adjust balance wheels to have a minimum 1/16-inch gap with the track at
 all times during the operation of the span. Swing the span open and closed. If
 at any point the gap between the balance wheels and the track exceeds 3/16
 inch, that portion of the track must be re-leveled.
 820.08.9 End Lift Reactions and Elevations (Swing Span):
 Notify the Bridge Engineer 14 calendar days prior to measuring the end lift
 reactions so the EOR or a designated representative may be present.
 Measurement of end lift reactions and elevations shall be performed after span
 balancing has been completed.
 Submit cut sheets to the Bridge Engineer for review of hydraulic jacks and
 pressure gauges. Select jack size so that the expected load will register between
 2,000 and 4,000 psi. Use 0-5,000 psi digital pressure gauges with an accuracy
 of ± 0.25 percent full scale. New gauges shall come with NIST certification.
 Used gauges shall be newly certified. Power units shall be capable of holding
 the load for the duration of the measurement process without significant
 leakage of hydraulic fluid.

 and two identical hydraulic jacks with known bore sizes for the short arm. All
 four jacks shall be the same size for an equal arm span. Locate the jacks at the
 end lift locations as shown on the plans. Each jack shall be connected to a
 786
 
 separate power unit. Pressure gauges should be mounted directly to the jacks,
 if possible. Otherwise, pressure gauges shall be located as close to the jacks as
 practical. Jacks must be completely free of air before measurement.
 Measure end lift reactions in the morning when the effects of temperature
 on the main girders are at a minimum. Jack all four corners of the span
 simultaneously until design reactions are achieved. Allow time for pressure
 readings to stabilize. Monitor elevations to ensure that each corner is lifting
 correctly. Survey roadway surface elevations at each gutter line, the profile
 grade line at each end of the span, and at the pivot girder location. Tolerances
 between survey and plan elevations are ± 1/4 inch at span ends and ± 3/8 inch
 at the pivot girder location. If elevations are not within tolerances, adjust
 spacer plate under the pivot girder while weighing the span under 820.08.10
 and repeat the process until tolerance is achieved.
 After end lift elevations have been determined, construct risers for end
 wedge shoes and install/shim the end wedge shoes to meet elevations. At this
 point, approach spans adjacent to the movable span may be constructed to
 match movable span elevations.
 820.08.10 Weighing the Movable Span (Swing Span): Notify the
 Bridge Engineer 14 calendar days prior to weighing the movable span so the
 EOR or a designated representative may be present. Weighing of the movable
 span shall be performed after measurement of end lift reactions has been
 completed. Spacer plate under the pivot girder can be adjusted at this time if
 required.
 Submit Cut Sheets for hydraulic jacks and pressure gauges to the Bridge
 Engineer for review. Select jack size so that the expected load will register
 between 6,000 and 8,000 psi. Use 0-10,000 psi digital pressure gauges with an
 accuracy of ± 0.25 percent full scale. New gauges shall come with NIST
 certification. Used gauges shall be newly certified.
 Use two identical hydraulic jacks with known bore sizes, and locate them
 under the pivot girder where shown on the plans. Each jack should be
 connected to a separate power unit. Power units shall be capable of holding the
 load for the duration of the weighing process without significant leakage of
 hydraulic fluid. Pressure gauges should be mounted directly to the jacks if
 possible. Otherwise, pressure gauges shall be located as close to the jacks as
 practical. Jacks shall be completely free of air before measurement.
 Retract wedges and raise the span until all load has been removed from the
 pivot bearing. Allow time for pressure readings to stabilize. Record readings
 and repeat two more times. Measurements are good if they are within 1 percent
 of each other. Submit pressure readings to the Bridge Engineer for review.
 787
 
 Actual span weight shall not differ from the design weight by more than ± 5
 percent.
 If an adjustment needs to be made to the pivot girder elevation during this
 procedure, remove the existing spacer plate while jacking the span and replace
 with a single spacer plate machined to the required thickness.

 sheave pedestals with an embedded template as shown on the plans. Use
 survey equipment to locate templates horizontally and vertically. All four
 templates must be square to each other and at the same elevation ±1/2 inch. No
 individual anchor bolt can be located more than 1/2 inches from its specified
 location in all directions. Anchor bolts shall be vertical to within 0.5 degrees.
 788
 
 Securely anchor template and monitor template locations while the concrete
 deck is placed and vibrated to assure no movement.
 2. Installation of Sheave Pedestals: After both machinery decks have
 met the requirements for form removal, survey the elevations of all four sheave
 locations to determine the highest location. Place the first sheave pedestal at
 this location. Using the leveling screws provided, set the elevation of the top of
 the sheave pedestal to ±1/16 inch of the design elevation. Adjust pedestal
 elevation, if needed, to allow for a minimum 2-inch grout pad. Level pedestal
 in all directions with a machinist’s level.
 Install remaining three sheave pedestals, and adjust the elevations of these
 pedestals to match the elevation of the first pedestal. This should require these
 pedestals to have a grout pad greater than 2 inches. Level all pedestals with a
 machinist’s level. The Project Engineer will verify all pedestal elevations.
 Submit elevations to the Bridge Engineer for review. All elevations shall be
 accurate to within ±1/16 inch.
 Coat leveling screws with lubricant to prevent adhesion of grout. Form up
 and grout under the sheave pedestals as shown on the plans using a prepackaged non-shrink epoxy grout with a minimum seven day compressive

 horizontally.
 c. Sheaves on the same tower are the correct distance apart and the
 correct distance from the centerline of the bridge.
 
 789
 
 d. Sheaves on opposite towers are the correct distance apart and the
 correct distance from the centerline of the channel.
 e. The diagonal distances between the sheaves are equal.
 All distances shall be accurate to within ± 1/8 inch.
 After review of the data, a representative of the EOR will schedule a site
 visit to verify sheave placement. Be prepared to demonstrate the submitted data
 with survey equipment and other measurement devices. After sheave
 placement has been verified, install turned bolts/fitted pins in trunnion
 bearings.
 4. Determination of Maximum Gear Runout: Prior to installing the
 counterweight wire ropes, determine the maximum and minimum gear runout
 on each sheave. Record this data and submit to the Bridge Engineer for review.

 tooth with the maximum runout is aligned with the future placement of the
 pinion gear.
 5. Clean Sheave Assemblies and Apply Touch-up Paint: Immediately
 after completing the installation of the sheave assemblies, clean sheave
 assemblies and pedestals, and touch up paint where damaged. Do not remove
 the protective grease from or paint the face of the sheave gear teeth.
 820.09.4 Installation of Sheave Assemblies (Steel Towers):
 Use the same installation procedure as 820.09.3 “Installation of Sheave
 Assemblies (Concrete Towers)” except as follows:
 1. Installation of Sheave Pedestals: Survey area of machinery deck
 where sheave pedestals will be located. Machinery deck plate steel must be flat
 to within ±1/16 inch in all locations under the pedestals. Project Engineer must
 verify flatness measurements. Install all four sheave pedestals.
 Use survey equipment to determine the elevation of the top of each sheave
 pedestal. Project Engineer must verify elevation measurements. Calculate the
 thickness for a single spacer plate on each sheave pedestal (eight plates) to
 bring the sheave pedestal elevations to the design elevation. Submit shop
 drawings for the spacer plates to the Bridge Engineer for review. Shop
 drawings shall show current pedestal elevations. After completing the review
 process, fabricate and install spacer plates. Re-survey sheave pedestal
 elevations and submit the data to the Bridge Engineer for review. All final
 elevations shall be within ± 1/16 inch of the design elevations.

 to install span drive machinery until the movable span nears completion.
 Turned bolts/fitted pins for pinion shaft bearings shall not be installed until the
 sheave is fully loaded with the weight of the completed movable span and
 counterweight.
 1. Installation of Span Drive Machinery: Sheaves should still be locked
 in position, and the sheave gear teeth with the maximum runout should still be
 in position to mate with the pinion gears. Without removing the protective
 grease on the pinion gear or the sheave gear that was applied in the shop,
 perform a preliminary alignment of the pinion gears. Locate and install the
 span drive machinery base by aligning with the pinion shafts. Span drive
 machinery base and pillow block bearing supports shall be installed as shown
 on the plans, and in a similar method as the sheave pedestals. Install all span
 drive machinery. Fully lubricate all bearings, gearboxes, couplings, and seals.
 
 792
 
 2. Alignment of Pinion Gears: After the sheave has the full load of the
 completed movable span and counterweight, remove the protective grease from
 the pinion and sheave gears. Fully align the pinion gear so that the backlash is
 near the lower end of the range shown on the plans. Backlash at each end of a
 tooth shall be equal. Install undersized bolts, and use chock blocks as shown
 on the plans to fix the pinion bearings in place. Do not install turned
 bolts/fitted pins at this time.
 Apply non-drying gear bluing compound to the entire sheave gear. Unlock
 sheave, rotate one full revolution, and inspect tooth contact. For acceptable
 gear contact, 80 percent of the teeth shall have 80 percent contact along the
 face of the teeth, and no teeth shall have less than 50 percent contact. If tooth
 contact does not meet this requirement, adjust pinion alignment and retest.
 Repeat until gear alignment meets both the backlash and tooth contact
 requirements.
 Record all backlash measurements (all sheaves and both ends of the teeth)
 and take pictures of the tooth contact. Pictures shall show teeth with best
 contact and worst contact. Submit data to the Bridge Engineer for review.
 3. Site Inspection to Check Pinion Gear Alignment: Provide a 14
 calendar day notice to the Bridge Engineer to schedule a site inspection to

 elevations shall be accurate to within ± 1/16 inch. Locate span lock on base
 such that the center of the latch, when extended, is over the center of the catch
 when the latch is horizontal. Shim span lock so that there is a 1/16-inch gap
 between the latch and the catch when the latch is extended. Adjust limit
 switches so that the span lock latch is fully inside the enclosure when retracted
 and horizontal when extended.
 820.09.13 Installation of Air Buffers (Vertical Lift): Install air
 buffers as shown on the plans and thoroughly lubricate. Provide air pressure
 gauges (0-300psi) and install in place of the oilers. Operate span and adjust air
 valves until the span seats gently and all buffers see approximately the same
 maximum pressure. This should be between 75 and 100 psi. Be prepared to
 demonstrate pressure settings during final setup and inspection, and have
 personnel and tools available to make additional adjustments at that time. After
 air buffer operation has been accepted, match mark the air valve position and

 wires that have been joined, the joints shall be spaced at least 25 feet apart.
 8. Strand Testing: No testing is required.
 9. Wire Rope Fabrication: Notify the Bridge Engineer 45 calendar days
 prior to fabrication of the wire rope so the Department may have an inspector
 present.
 Fabricate in accordance with the current revision of ASTM A1023 and
 these specifications. Wire ropes shall be 6x19 classification with 6x25 filler
 wire construction. Wire ropes shall be preformed, have right regular lay, and
 the maximum length of the lay shall be 7.5 times the diameter of the wire rope.
 Wire ropes shall have uniform physical properties in accordance with Tables
 821-6 and 821-7, and shall be laid in accordance with the best industry
 practices.
 
 833
 
 All counterweight ropes used on one bridge structure shall be fabricated
 from one production length of wire rope. If this is not possible due to the
 amount of wire rope required, an additional production length can be used.
 a. Independent Wire Rope Core (IWRC): If the wire rope is specified to
 have an IWRC, fabricate the IWRC in accordance with the same specifications
 as the wire rope, except that the classification and type of construction of the
 IWRC shall be in accordance with the wire rope manufacturer's standards.
 b. Lubrication: Fiber cores shall be lubricated prior to fabrication of the
 wire rope. All other wire rope components shall be lubricated during the
 fabrication process. The lubricant shall contain a rust inhibitor and shall be

 10. Wire Rope Testing: Notify the Bridge Engineer 45 calendar days prior
 to assembly of the test segments and any wire rope testing so the Department
 may have an inspector present.
 The wire rope manufacturer shall provide proper facilities and test
 equipment to perform required tests. Detailed test reports shall be submitted to
 the Fabrication Engineer and the Bridge Engineer for review and acceptance
 for each test performed. Test reports shall describe all test procedures and list
 all test results.
 a. Test Segments of Wire Rope: Test one segment from each end of
 each production length of wire rope used on the project. Test segments shall be
 at least 50 rope diameters long, but not longer than 12 feet.
 b. Test Sockets: For testing purposes, select sockets at random from the
 sockets fabricated for use on the project. Use one span socket and one
 counterweight socket for each test segment. No sockets used in testing shall be
 used on the project.
 c. Test Segment Assembly: Attach one span socket and one
 counterweight socket to each end of a wire rope test segment in a similar
 manner to that which will be used for the counterweight ropes. Clean area
 where the wire rope enters the socket, and make a suitable mark around the
 rope adjacent to the socket such that any movement can be readily measured.
 Repeat process for each test segment.
 d. Wire Rope Strength Test: Stress each test segment assembly until
 destruction. If a test segment assembly breaks before reaching the ultimate
 strength listed in Tables 821-6 and 821-7, select two additional test segments
 from that production length and retest. If either of these test segments fail the
 834
 
 strength test, the entire production length shall be rejected. Fabricate a new
 production length and repeat the testing procedure.
 e. Socket Strength Test: Sockets shall be stronger than the wire rope. If
 a socket fails during the wire rope strength test, perform the test again with
 four more sockets of the same type that failed (span or counterweight) selected
 at random from the sockets that will be used on the project. If any of these
 sockets fail, all sockets of that type shall be rejected. Fabricate new sockets
 from stronger steel or a heavier design, and retest.
 During the strength test, the seating of the wire rope between the zinc and
 the socket shall not exceed 1/6 the diameter of the wire rope. Seating in excess
 of 1/6 the diameter of the wire rope shall be cause for rejection of that
 connection.
 11. Prestretching: Lay wire rope straight and twisted to the correct lay.
 Paint a line along the entire length of one side of the wire rope to indicate the
 proper lay for installation in the field. Apply a load equal to 40 percent of the
 wire rope's ultimate strength as listed in Tables 821-6 and 821-7 and hold for
 five minutes. Reduce the load to five percent of the wire rope's ultimate
 strength, and repeat the process two more times. Release load.
 12. Measurement of Segment Lengths: After prestretching is complete,
 support the wire rope at intervals no greater than 25 feet. Apply a load equal to
 12 percent of the wire rope's ultimate strength to approximate the "as installed"
 load. Measure and cut the wire rope segments to lengths as shown on the plans.
 Segments shall be cut from one production length of wire rope. No splicing of
 the wire rope or its component strands will be allowed.
 13. Socket Attachment: Notify the Bridge Engineer 45 calendar days prior
 to the attachment of sockets so the Department may have an inspector present.
 The wire rope manufacturer shall attach the sockets to the wire rope using a
 molten zinc method sufficient to meet all requirements for wire rope testing
 specified in 821.07.33.10. Use the best industry practices to make attachments.
 Sockets for wire ropes that are smaller than or equal to 1 1/2 inches shall be
 preheated to insure zinc flows to the bottom of the socket.
 Clean excess wire rope lubricant from the socket connection and any excess
 wire rope lubricant that may have run onto the sockets due to the heat of the
 connection process. Paint a line around the wire rope where it enters the
 sockets so that any slippage between the wires and the zinc can be seen.
 14. Proof Loading: Apply a load equal to 40 percent of the wire rope's
 ultimate strength as listed in Tables 821-6 and 821-7 to each counterweight
 rope and hold for five minutes. Remove load and inspect the connections
 between the wire rope and the sockets. Seating of the wire rope between the
 835
 
 zinc and the socket shall not exceed 10 percent of the diameter of the wire
 rope. Seating in excess of 10 percent of the diameter of the wire rope shall be
 cause for rejection of that connection. Any visible movement between the
 individual wires of the wire rope and the zinc shall be cause for rejection of the
 connection. If either of these cases occurs, the wire rope manufacturer shall
 determine the cause of the failure, develop a new connection method, and
 assemble a replacement counterweight rope.
 15. Measurement of Counterweight Ropes: After proof loading is
 complete, lay the counterweight ropes straight and twisted to the correct lay.
 Support the counterweight ropes at intervals not greater than 25 feet, and apply
 a load equal to 12 percent of the wire rope's ultimate strength to approximate
 the "as installed" load. Measure and record the lengths of the counterweight
 ropes. For counterweight ropes shorter than or equal to 100 feet in length, the
 measured length shall be plus or minus 1/4 inch of the design length. For
 counterweight ropes longer than 100 feet in length, the measured length shall
 be plus or minus 0.0002 times the design length. Reject counterweight rope
 lengths that do not conform to these tolerances.
 16. Paint: If paint has been specified for the sockets, clean and apply all
 paint coatings in the Shop after measurement of counterweight ropes has been
 completed. Protect the wire rope during the cleaning and painting process.
 17. Shims: To adjust for the permissible deviation in counterweight rope
 lengths specified in 821.07.33.15, the wire rope manufacturer shall fabricate a
 single, stainless steel, slotted shim (see material specification) that shall be
 attached to the rope end of the span socket. This shim is not load bearing, but
 will assist the contractor during the initial installation of the counterweight
 ropes by providing a visual cue for the actual counterweight rope length.
 Fabricate shims such that the actual counterweight rope length will be within
 1/32 inch of the design counterweight rope length. Minimum shim thickness
 shall be 3/8 inch. Maximum shim thickness shall be two times the
 counterweight rope length tolerance plus 3/8 inch. For a counterweight rope
 100 feet or less, this would be 7/8 inch. Attach shim to the span socket with
 two cap screws (see material specification). Cap screw length shall be based
 upon the thickness of the shim and a minimum thread engagement in the
 socket of 5/8 inch.
 Stamp the shim thickness and the counterweight rope number on the
 outward facing side of each shim.
 18. Packaging and Identification: The wire rope manufacturer shall supply
 the assembled counterweight ropes on individual reels. Provide reels with the
 span socket out or the counterweight socket out, in accordance with
 836
 
 the installer's preference. The diameter of the reels shall be not less than 25
 times the diameter of the counterweight rope.
 Fabricate and permanently attach a corrosion resistant metal tag to the span
 end of each counterweight rope. The tag shall list the wire rope manufacturer
 and address, the counterweight rope number, the design length, the fabricated
 length, shim thickness, and a number traceable to the wire rope manufacturer's
 production length.
 19. Field Storage: Once shipped to the project site, locate counterweight
 rope reels such that neither the wire rope nor the sockets can come in contact
 with vegetation, mud, or standing water.
 20. Field Installation: Conform to 820.09.6 for field installation.

 Section 901
 Portland Cement Concrete
 901.01 GENERAL. This section specifies requirements for portland
 cement (PC) concrete, including methods and equipment for handling and
 storing materials, mixing, transporting, and placing concrete.
 Fresh concrete is being in a plastic state that has not achieved initial set.
 Structural concrete is designated by “Class” and pavement concrete by
 “Type.”
 Portland cement concrete shall conform to the requirements of Table 9013, “Master Proportion Table for Portland Cement Concrete.” Fly ash or
 ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) is permitted as a partial
 replacement for PC in accordance with 901.08.2. All structural class
 concrete, except minor structure class concrete, requires permeability testing
 by surface resistivity in accordance with DOTD TR 233.
 Provide portland cement concrete from a Department approved mix
 design, produced from a Department certified plant, and transported in
 Department certified trucks.
 Provide sufficient plant capacity and transporting equipment to ensure
 delivery at required rates.
 Methods of delivery and handling concrete shall facilitate placing with
 minimum rehandling.
 Provide adequately equipped facilities or means for all quality control
 testing.
 Quality assurance requirements shall be as specified in the latest edition
 of the Department's publications entitled Application of Quality Assurance
 Specifications for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement and Structures or

 Microsilica (Silica Fume)
 Use cement, fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, and microsilica
 (silica fume) certified by the manufacturer in accordance with current
 Department procedures.
 Maintain accurate records of cement, fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace
 slag, and silica fume deliveries and their use. Furnish copies of these records
 to the engineer in such form as required.
 901.03 TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF CEMENTITIOUS
 MATERIALS. Transport cementitious materials in watertight conveyances
 and store in separate dry facilities. Reject material that is contaminated,
 partially set, or contains lumps of caked material.
 Do not mix brands, mills, types, grades, or classes unless authorized by
 the DOTD Materials Engineer Administrator. The engineer may waive this
 requirement in case of plant breakdown during production to allow concrete,
 conforming to the requirements of this Section 901, furnished from another
 plant to finish a placement in progress.
 901.04 HANDLING AND STORAGE OF AGGREGATES. Stockpile
 aggregates so that no detrimental degradation, contamination or segregation
 of aggregates results. Do not incorporate any foreign material into the
 aggregates. Provide a positive separation between natural ground and
 stockpile. Do not intermingle individual stockpiled materials. Do not add
 material to working faces of the stockpiles during continuous operations.
 Maintain drainage of stockpiles to control moisture content. Control
 aggregates to maintain the required gradation. Do not use aggregates that
 have become segregated or contaminated.
 901.05 SAMPLING AND TESTING. Perform sampling and testing in
 accordance with the Department's “Materials Sampling Manual and Testing
 Procedures Manual”. Furnish necessary materials for testing at no direct pay.
 For pumped concrete, sample at the discharge end of pump.
 901.06 QUALITY CONTROL OF CONCRETE. The contractor is
 responsible for quality control of materials during handling, proportioning,
 mixing, and placing operations, which includes the following:
 
 915
 
 1. Initial determination and necessary subsequent adjustments in
 proportioning of materials used to produce the specified concrete;
 2. Providing suitable equipment for determination of aggregate
 gradation, moisture, air content, slump, unit weight, and temperature;
 3. Trial mixes as necessary;
 4. Testing and analysis of the mix for quality control purposes;
 5. The setting of dials, gauges, scales or meters, adjusting batch
 weights; and accurate batching.
 Furnish a Certified Concrete Technician at the plant or job site to make
 adjustments in batch weights for moisture content, to perform necessary
 adjustments in proportioning materials, and to perform tests necessary for
 control of the concrete mix within specification requirements. Do not begin
 daily plant operations until the Certified Concrete Technician has determined
 that gradations and batch weight adjustments are within specification limits.
 The Certified Concrete Technician or the Authorized Concrete Field Tester
 shall perform the job-site control tests for slump, air content, mix
 temperature, and then report the documented results to the contractor. The
 use of an Authorized Concrete Field Tester will not relieve the Certified
 Concrete Technician from performing the remaining duties as outlined in
 these specifications.
 The contractor's Certified Concrete Technician and Authorized Concrete
 Field Tester shall be certified or authorized upon satisfactory completion of
 the Department's requirements. Personnel with a current ACI Concrete Field
 Testing Technician Grade I certification qualify as an Authorized Concrete
 Field Tester.
 901.06.1 Mix Design: The Certified Concrete Technician shall submit
 a proposed concrete mix design on the form provided by the Department
 showing details for concrete to be furnished. Do not start work until the
 concrete mix design has been accepted and signed by the District Laboratory
 Engineer. Review and acceptance of this mix design does not release the
 contractor from the responsibility of producing concrete that meets the
 minimum requirements of the specifications.
 Proportion the volume of coarse aggregates in concrete mixes in
 accordance with Table 901-1 below. This does not apply to mixes for
 concrete pipe, Types B and D pavement, and minor structure class concrete.
 Fine aggregate must have fineness Moduli (FM) between 2.20 and 3.00. For
 an example of proportioning of coarse aggregate, see the Department's
 publication entitled Application of Quality Assurance Specifications for
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement and Structures.

 1Volumes are based on aggregates in dry-rodded condition as described in AASHTO
 T19, Unit Weight of Aggregate. These volumes are selected from empirical relationships
 to produce concrete with a degree of workability suitable for usual reinforced concrete
 construction. For less workable concrete such as required for concrete pavement
 construction, these volumes may be increased up to 10 percent. For more workable
 concrete, as may be required for pumping, these volumes may be reduced up to 10
 percent.
 
 Proportion aggregates for pavement Types B and D mixes in accordance
 with 1003. 08.3.
 Perform trial mixes to demonstrate the mix’s performance and the
 compatibility of components.
 Submit test results for slump, unit weight, air content, set times, and
 surface resistivity (i.e., permeability) when required. Develop a curve for
 compressive strength (flexural strength for pavements if required) at 3, 7, 14,
 and 28 days. All trial mixes, especially those incorporating ASTM C494
 Type S admixtures, shall demonstrate their intended specific use and
 compliance with this section to the District Lab Engineer. Submit these
 findings to the DOTD Fabrication Engineer for all precast and prestress
 elements.
 Furnish materials to the Department for verification of trial mixes as
 requested.
 The District Laboratory Engineer may waive trial mixes, in writing, for
 previously accepted mix designs. Waiver of trial mixes does not release the
 contractor from the responsibility of producing concrete that meets the
 minimum requirements of the specifications.
 Ensure that slumps are within the ranges shown in Table 901-3 when
 tested in accordance with DOTD TR 207. The Chief Construction Engineer
 may authorize an increase in maximum slump, without mix segregation, by
 use of water reducing admixtures. Formulate mixes to produce concrete that,
 917
 
 when molded and cured in accordance with DOTD TR 226 and tested in
 accordance with DOTD TR 230, show an average compressive strength not
 less than shown in Table 901-3.
 901.06.2 Quality Control Tests: Conduct tests to confirm the mix
 complies with the accepted mix design. Determine gradation and moisture
 content of aggregates used in the concrete mixture. Test the mixture at the
 job site for slump, unit weight, temperature, and air content. Keep mix
 variations within specified control limits for individual samples. Plot test
 results for gradation, slump, unit weight, and air content on control charts
 for individual samples. Submit these control charts to the engineer.
 Monitor the mix components (cementitious materials, chemical
 admixtures, chemical additives, and aggregates) for variations. As
 cementitious materials and chemical admixture shipments arrive, verify
 slump, air content, and initial set time by testing at ambient temperatures.
 Adjust the mix design to rectify any changes, which would adversely affect
 constructability, concrete placement, or compliance with the specifications.
 Document the testing to validate component consistency on the control
 charts. Note conformance or variation in mix parameters (workability, set
 times, air content, etc.) on the control charts. Provide a copy of the proposed
 testing plan to the engineer for record. Acceptance of the plan does not
 relieve the contractor of the responsibility for satisfying specifications.
 Select times to obtain control test samples using random number tables
 in accordance with DOTD S 605 or by random selection. Conform to
 gradation control limits of aggregates as shown in 1003.08.
 Use the Materials Sampling Manual to determine the minimum number
 of quality control tests for structural and pavement concrete. Take additional
 test samples as directed for slump, concrete temperature, and air content.
 For minor structure concrete only, a Certified Concrete Technician or
 Authorized Concrete Field Tester will not be required, but implement a
 quality control testing program to ensure that the concrete meets the
 requirements of these specifications.
 When producing concrete for Types B and D pavements, determine
 gradations daily on each stockpile of aggregates. Base all gradation
 calculations on percent of dry weight. Upon determination of the gradation
 of each stockpile, mathematically determine the percent of the total
 aggregates retained based on the proportions of the combined aggregate
 blend, and check for conformance with Table 1003-19.
 For additional QC requirements for Mass Concrete, see 901.12.
 901.06.3 Mix Adjustments: It is permissible to adjust the ratio of fine
 to coarse aggregates of the approved mix design by no more than 5 percent.
 918
 
 Never adjust to materially affect the volume of concrete. For mixtures
 incorporating the Type B or D gradation, if the proportions of the aggregate
 sizes used do not satisfy the gradation requirements of 1003.08.3 due to
 changes in the gradation, adjust the proportions to bring the combined
 aggregates back within specification limits. These minor adjustments for
 gradation will not require a new mix design. Ensure that the mix produced
 is uniform, workable and within the specification limits of Table 901-3.
 When plant operations do not produce a uniform and workable mix, cease
 plant operations and take corrective action prior to restart.
 When slump, air content, concrete temperature, or gradation
 measurements, as plotted on control charts, indicate that the mix is not
 uniform and may fall outside tolerance limits, immediately make
 adjustments to keep the mix within specified limits. Failure to make proper
 adjustments or the mix deviates from specification requirements, or the mix
 is obviously defective, the Department will reject the mix.
 Do not change sources of any materials or percentages of cementitious
 materials, until a new Mix Design form showing the new material or
 adjusted proportions hasbeen accepted.
 901.06.4 Acceptance and Verification for PCCP Types B
 and D Concrete: Use the Materials Sampling Manual to determine
 sampling and testing requirements for acceptance and verification for
 concrete for Types B and D pavements, except as follows:
 1. Gradation testing of individual stockpiles for acceptance will not
 be required.
 2. Verification tests, performed by the District Laboratory to assure
 conformance to the combined aggregate gradation shown in Table 1003-19,
 are at the frequency of one sample every five days of production.
 3. Upon determination of the gradation of each aggregate size
 sampled, mathematically determine the percent retained based on the dry
 weight of the total combined aggregates based on the proportions of the
 combined aggregate blend, and check for conformance with Table 1003-19.
 4. If the results of the verification sample indicate that, the
 combination of aggregates does not meet the requirements of 1003.08.3, resample the aggregates, and test again. If the results of the second verification
 sample indicate that the combination of aggregates does not meet the
 requirements of 1003.08.3, adjust operations to produce a mix meeting these
 specifications. The Department will investigate and compare verification
 results to quality control results, for the same period, to determine
 appropriate action.

 concrete may be substituted with Class A1 concrete.
 
 901.08 COMPOSITION OF CONCRETE.
 Type of cement and
 composition of concrete shall be in accordance with the requirements of this
 Section 901 and Table 901-3. For mix designs not conforming to Section
 901 or Table 901-3, the approval of the Chief Construction Engineer is
 required.
 
 920
 
 901.08.1 Cement: Allowable types of cement are as follows:
 Use
 General Construction (Structural
 Class Concrete and Minor
 Structure Class Concrete)
 
 Allowable Cement Types
 Type I and/or II portland cement;
 Blended Hydraulic Cement
 Type IL portland lime cement
 
 Concrete Pavement
 
 Type I and/or II portland cement;
 Blended Hydraulic Cement
 Type IL portland lime cement
 Type III portland cement for high early
 strength (HES) applications only
 
 Prestressed
 Concrete
 
 or
 
 Precast Type I and/or II, or III portland cement;
 Blended Hydraulic Cement
 Type IL portland lime cement
 
 901.08.2 Cementitious Material Substitution: For structural
 classes of concrete, fly ash conforming to 1001.04 and GGBFS conforming
 to 1001.05 may be partially substituted for portland cement on a pound for
 pound basis. For purposes of cement material substitution with fly ash and
 slag, do not treat Type IL cement as blended.
 A binary concrete mix is one that combines portland cement and one
 additional cementitious replacement, e.g., GGBFS or fly ash (class C or F).
 A ternary concrete mix is one that combines portland cement with two
 additional cementitious replacements, e.g., GGBFS and fly ash (class C or
 F) or fly ash (both class C and F).
 The maximum substitution rate for binary mixtures is 30 percent fly ash
 or 50 percent GGBFS.
 The maximum substitution rate for ternary mixtures containing Type I,
 II, III, or 1L portland cement is 70 percent of cement. When using Type IP
 or IS portland cement, the maximum substitution rate for ternary mixtures is
 40 percent. Ternary combinations using both class C and F fly ash are
 allowable. When using fly ash ternary mixtures, replace portland cement
 with class C and class F fly ash in equal amounts. When using combinations
 of GGBFS and fly ash, the amount of GGBFS must be equal to or greater
 than the amount of fly ash.
 For pavement types of concrete (Types B and D), the maximum
 substitution rate for ternary mixtures is limited to 50 percent of cement and
 for binary mixtures is 30 percent fly ash or 50 percent GGBFS.
 
 921
 8
 
 The use of Type III portland cement outside of the specified allowances
 for precast, prestress, and specified HES pavements requires the approval of
 the Chief Construction Engineer.
 901.08.3 Chemical Admixtures: Only use admixtures complying
 with 1011.02, or listed on the Approved Materials List.
 Use an air-entraining admixture in all concrete. Test the total air content
 of the concrete in accordance with DOTD TR 202, and meet the
 requirements specified in Table 901-3.
 Use set-retarding admixtures in an amount sufficient to produce the
 necessary retardation. Consider the influence of different materials and job
 conditions, including local weather on setting characteristics.
 Include the amount of water incorporated in admixtures as a part of
 required mixing water.
 Follow manufacturer’s recommendations for adding and mixing high
 range water reducers (HRWR, superplasticizer) to the mix.
 When using multiple admixtures, ensure the same company manufactures
 all the admixtures, and they are all compatible.
 901.08.4 Water: Ensure that the total amount of water in the
 mixture, including admixtures and free water, does not exceed the maximum
 water- cementitious ratio specified in Table 901-3. Free water includes all
 water entering the mix with the aggregates, except water absorbed by the
 aggregate.
 901.08.5 Aggregates: Ensure that all aggregates for use in
 portland cement concrete meet the requirements of 1003.01.
 901.08.5.1 Fine Aggregates: Ensure that fine aggregates, except
 for combined gradations for Types B and D, comply with the requirements
 of 1003.08.1.
 901.08.5.2 Coarse Aggregates: Ensure that coarse aggregates,
 except for combined gradations for Types B and D, are the grade specified
 in Table 901-3 and comply with the requirements of 1003.08.2. In concrete
 for bridge decks, use coarse aggregates with a friction rating of I, II, or III in
 accordance with 1003.01.2.4.
 901.08.5.3 Aggregates for Types B and D Gradations:
 Ensure that combined aggregate gradations comply with the requirements of
 1003.08.3.
 901.09 EQUIPMENT. Provide sufficient plant capacity and transporting
 equipment to ensure delivery at the required rate. Ensure that the rate of
 delivery provides for proper handling, placing and finishing of concrete and
 maintains a workable surface. Ensure that methods of delivering and
 922
 
 handling concrete facilitate placing with a minimum of rehandling and
 without damage to the structure or concrete.
 901.09.1 Plant Equipment: Ensure that batch plants include
 approved storage, weigh hoppers, and measuring devices. Properly seal
 and vent equipment to minimize contamination, dusting and loss of material.
 Ensure uniform distribution of the incorporated materials.
 Provide adequate water supply and a device for automatically controlling
 the amount of water used in each batch.
 Provide communication between the concrete batcher and loader
 operator.
 901.09.1.1 Direct-Fill Elevating Weigh Hoppers: For plants
 using direct-fill elevating weigh hoppers, use computer controlled lights as
 an indicator of aggregate weights, but not as the sole means of control for
 aggregate proportioning. Provide means of control so that, as approaching
 the quantity desired in the weigh hopper, material may be added slowly and
 shut off with precision. Ensure that weigh hoppers eliminate accumulation of
 materials and discharges completely. Make provisions for removal of
 overloads.
 901.09.1.2 Storage Bins and Silos: For plants with storage bins,
 ensure that the bins have adequate separate compartments for each size of
 aggregate. Design each compartment to discharge efficiently and freely.
 Provide a means of control so that, as approaching the quantity desired in the
 weigh hopper, material may be added slowly and shut off with precision.
 Ensure that silos are weatherproof, sealed, free of holes, and prevent
 contamination. Ensure complete separation for each cementitious material.
 Design silos to freely discharge and equip with vibrators and/or aerators to
 maintain flow of material and prevent accumulation. Provide silos with a
 positive means of shut off without leaking into the weigh hopper.
 901.09.1.3 Measuring Devices: Equip batch plants to proportion
 materials by approved weighing/metering devices. Moisture probes are
 allowed to determine the moisture content of aggregates for batch
 adjustment, provided the accuracy is within 0.5 percent of the results
 obtained by the Certified Concrete Technician in accordance with DOTD TR
 106 and confirmed by the engineer.
 Use separate scale systems: one for aggregates, and another for
 cementitious materials. Weigh each size of aggregate from separate bins
 either individually or cumulatively. Weighing each cementitious material
 cumulatively in the same hopper is allowable but measure the weight of the
 cement first before other cementitious materials.
 
 923
 
 Ensure that weigh hoppers eliminate accumulation of materials and
 discharge completely. Make provisions for removal of overloads.
 Ensure that scales are accurate to 0.5 percent throughout the range of use.
 Maximum graduation on scales shall be 0.1 percent of the rated scale
 capacity. When beam type scales are used, ensure that poises are lockable
 into any position to prevent accidental change of position, and the weigh
 beam and a telltale device is in view of the operator. Plant measuring devices
 shall be subject to approval by the Department. They shall be tested,
 inspected, and certified every 90-calendar days by a qualified independent
 scale service or the Weights and Measures Division of the Louisiana
 Department of Agriculture and Forestry at no direct cost to the Department
 and more frequently when the engineer deems it necessary to assure their
 accuracy. A qualified independent scale service or the Weights and Measures
 Division of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry shall
 certify the plant’s laboratory-measuring devices annually at no direct cost to
 the Department.
 Batch individual aggregates within 2 percent, and the cumulative total
 weight of aggregates within 1 percent of the required weight.
 Ensure that cementitious materials are within 1 percent of the required
 weight. For smaller batches of 1 to 3 cubic yards, the quantity of cement and
 cumulative quantity of cementitious materials shall be neither less than the
 required amount nor more than 4 percent in excess. Cement in standard bags
 need not be weighed; however, furnish in full bag increments and adjust the
 quantities of other materials accordingly. Do not use bagged fly ash or
 GGBFS.
 Measure the mixing water by volume or weight. Ensure that water
 measuring devices are accurate to 1 percent at 1/2 the maximum allowable
 water per batch and the maximum graduation is 1 gallon.
 Use approved methods and equipment for adding admixtures into the
 batch. Measure the quantity of admixtures with an accuracy of 3 percent.
 Provide a separate dispensing device for each admixture.
 901.09.1.4 Batch Tickets: Certified concrete plants may be
 equipped with an approved automatic ticket printer system for recording
 required batching information. Enter actual weights of material batched each
 time on the Batch Certification Report or an approved electronic document.
 When an automatic ticket printer system is not used, determine quantities
 and batching information by visual observation. The contractor's authorized
 representative shall record these quantities on the Batch Certification Report.
 Ensure that the approved ticket printer system is tamper-proof and prints
 time of batching, amount of water, batch weights, moisture content of
 924
 
 aggregates, and quantities of admixtures. The Certified Concrete Technician
 may add moisture content of aggregates or quantities of admixtures to the
 printed ticket when the automatic system does not have these capabilities.
 During a printer breakdown, determine quantities by visual observation and
 certify as stated above.
 Ensure that all records of batches show batch number, day, month, year,
 and time of day to the nearest minute for each batch. Record any added water
 on the Batch Certification Report Provide to the engineer, a legible copy of
 all batch records identified with lot number and mix design number.
 901.09.2 Hauling Equipment: Ensure that hauling equipment is
 watertight and capable of discharging concrete at a controlled rate without
 segregation.
 901.09.2.1 Truck Mixer: Provide revolving-drum truck mixers,
 equipped with tanks for carrying any additional portion of the mixing water
 and capable of dispensing to the nearest gallon. Replace pick-up and throwover blades in the mixing drum when worn beyond the limit recommended
 by the manufacturer. Have available a copy of the manufacturer's design,
 showing dimensions and arrangements of blades in reference to original
 height and depth.
 Equip truck mixers with electrically or mechanically actuated revolution
 counters. Locate counters to provide safe and convenient inspection.
 In a prominent place, attach to each truck mixer a metal plate on which is
 plainly marked the maximum rated capacity of the drum in terms of concrete
 volume and rotation speed for both agitating and mixing speeds.
 901.09.2.2 Agitator Hauling Equipment: Furnish agitators with
 blades or paddles to effectively agitate the mix and prevent segregation.
 Provide covers when directed.
 Attach to each agitator in a prominent place, a metal plate on which is
 plainly marked the designed uses for the equipment, the maximum rated
 capacity in terms of concrete volume, and agitation speed.
 901.09.2.3 Non-Agitator Hauling Equipment: Ensure that the
 bodies of non-agitating hauling equipment are clean, smooth, metal, and
 mortar-tight containers. Provide covers when directed.
 901.09.3 Portable (Volumetric) Mixers: Provide portable mixers
 with a minimum capacity of one cubic yard and capable of accurately and
 uniformly mixing and discharging concrete without segregation.
 901.10 BATCHING AND MIXING. Thoroughly mix concrete in a mixer
 of an approved size and type, which will ensure uniform distribution of
 materials throughout the mix.
 925
 
 Do not use mixers with worn blades or excessive build-up. Replace pickup and throw-over blades or mixing paddles in the mixing drum or mixing
 unit when worn beyond the limit recommended by the manufacturer. Have
 available a copy of the manufacturer's design, showing dimensions and
 arrangements of blades in reference to original height and depth.
 Begin mixing operations within 15 minutes after addition of cement to
 the aggregates. When there is an interruption to the mixing operations,
 thoroughly clean the mixer. Remove the entire contents of the mixer from
 the drum before placing materials for a succeeding batch. Add a portion of
 mixing water in advance of cement and aggregates. Do not use a mixer
 having a rated capacity of less than one cubic yard or charge a mixer in
 excess of its rated capacity. The minimum size batch shall be one cubic yard.
 901.10.1 Central Plant and Site Mixing: Mix concrete until
 uniformity is achieved but not less than 60 seconds. Mixing time begins after
 all materials are in the mixer. Mixing time ends when the discharge chute
 opens. Ensure that the mixer is equipped with an approved timing device,
 which automatically locks the discharge lever when charging the drum and
 releases it at the end of the mixing period. During mixing, operate the mixer
 at its designed drum speed as shown on the manufacturer's nameplate on the
 mixer.
 901.10.2 Truck Mixing: In accordance with 901.09, measure
 aggregates and cementitious materials for concrete and charge into the drum
 at the proportioning plant.
 Ensure that the size of the batch does not exceed the maximum rated
 mixing capacity as stated by the manufacturer and stamped on a metal plate
 on the mixer. When using a truck mixer for complete mixing, mix each batch
 at designated mixing speed until uniformity is achieved, but not less than 70
 revolutions. Ensure that all materials, including mixing water, are in the
 mixer drum before actuating the revolution counter or taking an initial
 reading. Ensure that any additional revolutions during transit are at the
 designated agitating speed.
 Add a minimum of 75 percent of the prescribed amount of batch water at
 the plant. If the slump is low at the jobsite, add up to the “maximum water
 that can be added at jobsite” as indicated on the Batch Certification form.
 Ensure that water added at the jobsite does not exceed the maximum
 allowable water-cementitious material ratio or exceed the maximum
 allowable slump by more than 1/4 inch. Reject the load if these criteria are
 exceeded. Add water and/or admixtures at the job site in one or two
 increments with additional mixing within the range of 20 to 30 revolutions
 at designated mixer speed for each increment.
 926
 
 When adding to a partial load, add only a proportional amount of water
 or admixtures. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations when adding
 and mixing admixtures to the mix.
 Perform slump, air, temperature, and unit weight tests, and mold
 cylinders after the addition of all components into the mix.
 901.10.3 Partial Mixing at Central Plant (Shrink Mixing): When
 partially mixing at a central plant, reduce the mixing time to a minimum of
 30 seconds. Complete required mixing in a truck mixer at mixing speed until
 uniformity is achieved but not less than 10 revolutions.
 901.10.4 Time Limitations: Ensure that the maximum time from the
 addition of cement to the mix to final placement of the concrete is 90 minutes
 or a maximum of 300 revolutions, whichever occurs first. When transport is
 by non-agitator truck, ensure that the maximum time from the addition of
 cement to the mix to final placement of the concrete is 45 minutes. The
 engineer may reduce the maximum allowable time for any observed
 conditions contributing to rapid loss of plasticity or uniformity of the
 concrete.
 For special applications, the stated time limitations may be modified
 based on trial batch results.
 901.10.5 Hauling Equipment: Transport fresh concrete in a truck
 mixer, agitator, or other certified equipment. Non-agitator trucks are only
 allowed for pavement concrete. Ensure that the volume of mixed concrete
 transported in an agitator truck at agitation speed is in accordance with the
 manufacturer's specified rating.
 901.10.6 Portable Mixing: Obtain written approval from the Chief
 Construction Engineer to use portable or volumetric mixers for PCCP
 patching and minor structure concrete.
 901.10.7 Delivery: Provide sufficient plant capacity and transporting
 equipment to ensure delivery at the required rate. Ensure that methods and
 rate of delivery and handling of concrete facilitate placement, without
 damage to the structure or fresh concrete.
 901.11 WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE LIMITATIONS. Concrete
 used in precast/prestress structural elements may be exempt from the
 following temperature limitations at the determination of the Construction
 Fabrication Engineer.
 Prepare for rain and hot or cold weather concrete placement well in
 advance of these events.
 
 927
 
 The contractor is responsible for proper mixing, placing, and curing of all
 concrete. At no cost to the Department, remove and replace any unacceptable
 concrete as determined by the Department.
 901.11.1 Cold Weather Limitations: Do not place concrete when
 the internal temperature of the concrete is below 45°F nor on frozen subgrade
 or into forms that are below 32°F.
 901.11.1.1 PC Mixes: Discontinue concreting operations when a
 descending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from
 artificial heat, reaches 35°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less
 than 32°F within the 24-hour period following placement. Do not resume PC
 concreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the
 shade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 32°F; provided the high
 temperature forecasted by NOAA is above 35°F and remains above 32°F for
 a minimum of 24 hours.
 901.11.1.2 Binary Mixes: Discontinue concreting operations when
 a descending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from
 artificial heat, reaches 40°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less
 than 35°F within the 36-hour period following placement. Do not resume
 concreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the
 shade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 40°F; provided the high
 temperature forecasted by NOAA is above 45°F and remains above 40°F for
 a minimum of 36 hours.
 901.11.1.3 Ternary Mixes: Discontinue concreting operations
 when a descending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from
 artificial heat, reaches 45°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less
 than 40°F within the 48-hour period following placement. Do not resume
 concreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the
 shade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 45°F; provided the high
 temperature forecasted by NOAA is above 50°F and remains above 45°F for
 a minimum of 48 hours.
 Written authorization from the Chief Construction Engineer is required for
 all concrete operations outside these cold weather limitations.
 901.11.2 Hot Weather Limitations: During hot weather concreting,
 it is critical to reduce the evaporation rate from concrete to minimize plastic
 shrinkage cracking by having an appropriate concrete mix design, placement
 methods, and curing operations. Furthermore, additional moisture loss
 precautions may be essential when other environmental conditions (i.e.
 relative humidity, air temperature, and wind velocity) accelerate water
 evaporation from the concrete.
 
 928
 
 Hot weather limitations commence when the internal temperature of the
 concrete during placement, exceeds 85°F. If these conditions exist, maintain
 an internal concrete placement temperature less than 90ºF or submit concrete
 trial-batch test results for the concrete mix designs conforming to the
 requirements for production during hot weather conditions.
 The hot weather trial-batch acceptance criteria shall meet the following
 requirements:
 1. Maintain a minimum internal concrete temperature of 94°F throughout
 the trial-batching process.
 2. After initial mixing, hold the trial batch in the mixer for 90 minutes.
 During this period, turn the drum intermittently for 30 seconds every five
 minutes. In between the intermittent turning of the drum, cover the drum
 opening with an impermeable cover to prevent moisture loss and to maintain
 heat. At the end of the 90-minute period, remix the trial batch a minimum of
 one minute and then test for slump and air content.
 3. After completion of a 90-minute mixing period, ensure that the trialbatch has the desired workability, with slump and air content within the
 specified range as shown in Table 901-3. Allow the addition of water if the
 slump is below the target range but do not exceed the maximum water-tocementitious material ratio. Remix a minimum of two minutes after addition
 of second water. Furthermore, ensure that concrete temperature is not less
 than 94°F at any time during the trial batch testing.
 Concrete placed at a temperature exceeding 90ºF that fails to meet the hot
 weather trial-batch acceptance criteria shall be removed and replaced at no
 cost to the Department.
 The contractor is responsible for proper mixing, placing, and curing of
 concrete as determined by the Department.
 Regardless of any hot weather precaution taken, reject all concrete
 attaining an internal temperature in excess of 99ºF during placement.
 901.11.3 Rain Protection: Prior to any concreting operations, have
 available at the jobsite sufficient plastic sheeting material to prevent
 rainwater from marring or leaving indentations in any fresh concrete.
 Lap sections of plastic sheeting a minimum of 18 inches and extend
 coverage beyond edges so that edges are not marred by falling rainwater.
 Secure plastic sheeting so that it will remain in place to protect the surface.
 As soon as conditions permit, reapply all curing compound washed away by
 the rain. Repair all areas of tining or surface finishing marred by rain or
 plastic sheeting coverage. Repair all rain-damaged areas at no cost to the
 Department.
 
 929
 
 901.12 MASS CONCRETE.
 901.12.1 Description: Mass concrete is defined as a structural
 concrete placement having a least dimension of 48 inches or greater, or if
 designated on the plans or in the project specifications as being mass
 concrete. Structural Class S concrete is exempt from mass concrete
 requirements.
 901.12.2 General: Submit proposals for the mass concrete mix design,
 analysis, temperature monitoring, and control, including insulation and
 methods, to the Department for review and acceptance a minimum of 30 days
 prior to the placement of any mass concrete.
 901.12.3 Materials: The structural class designation for mass concrete
 is Class MASS (A1, A2, or A3) as shown in Table 901-3.
 901.12.3.1 Cement/Cementitious Combination: Use Type II
 portland cement. Replace portland cement with fly ash at 20 percent to 50
 percent by weight or replace with slag cement at 50 percent to 70 percent by
 weight or a ternary mix meeting specification requirements. Certify that the
 cementitious combination generates a heat of hydration of not more than 70
 calories/gram at 7 days as determined by ASTM C186 or ASTM C1702.
 901.12.3.2 Aggregates: Use Type B or D aggregate gradation for
 mass concrete. See 1003.08.3.
 901.12.3.3 Admixtures: Do not use accelerating admixtures in
 mass concrete.
 901.12.4 Construction: Produce a structure free from thermal cracks.
 Place mass concrete continuously to eliminate cold joints.
 Control differential temperatures by appropriate use of insulated forms,
 curing blankets, or other acceptable methods.
 If during the first 48 hours after placement, the temperature differential
 nears 35ºF, take corrective measures immediately to remain within the limits.
 Furthermore, revise the plan to maintain the limits on differential
 temperature on any remaining placements of mass concrete. Obtain the
 engineer's acceptance of the revised plan prior to implementation.
 Strength gain and cooling of the mass concrete placements can take a long
 time. Take all such time and strength considerations into account when
 planning construction activities.
 901.12.4.1 Analysis and Monitoring: Submit an analysis to the
 engineer of the projected thermal developments within the mass concrete
 elements for the anticipated concrete and ambient temperatures, along with
 the proposed mix design and construction methods. Include a copy of model
 results, with site and element specific data, and any electronic files. Describe
 the measures and procedures intended to maintain, monitor, and control the
 930
 7
 
 temperature differential between the interior and exterior of the mass
 concrete elements. A maximum temperature during curing of 160ºF and a
 maximum differential temperature of 35°F is allowed. An abbreviated
 submittal may be allowed for previously approved mass concrete mix
 designs.
 901.12.4.2 Monitoring Devices: Provide temperature-monitoring
 devices to record temperature development between the interior and the
 exterior of the element at points acceptable to the engineer. Monitor a
 minimum of two independent sets of interior and exterior points for each
 element to provide redundancy. Locate the monitoring points at the
 geometric center of the element for the interior point and two inches from
 the surface along the shortest line from the geometric center to the nearest
 surface of the element for the exterior point.
 Monitoring devices shall be automatic sensing and recording instruments
 that record information at a maximum interval of one hour. Calibrate
 monitoring devices to the manufacture’s recommendations. These devices
 shall operate within the temperature range of 0 to 180ºF with an accuracy of
 ± 2ºF. Take readings and record the temperature data at intervals no greater
 than 6 hours to ensure that the automatic devices are working properly and
 that the temperatures are within allowable limits. The intervals of one and
 six hours shall begin immediately after casting is complete and shall
 continue until the maximum temperature differential is reached and begins
 to drop. Transmit these readings to the engineer daily.
 Prior to the placement of mass concrete, perform a test of the automatic
 and manual thermal sensing and recording equipment to ensure they are
 operational.
 901.12.5 Payment for Mass Concrete: Materials, labor, equipment,
 and incidental items associated with mass concrete and controlling the heat
 of hydration are paid for under Section 805.
 901.13 ACCEPTANCE AND PAYMENT SCHEDULES. Acceptance

 pH Test: Five grams of fiber are added to 100 ml of distilled water, stirred and let
 sit for 30 minutes. The pH is determined with a probe calibrated with pH 7.0 buffer.
 4
 Oil Absorption Test: Five grams of fiber are accurately weighed and suspended in
 an excess of mineral spirits for not less than five minutes to ensure total saturation. It
 is then placed in a screen mesh strainer (approximately 0.5-square millimeter hole
 size) and shaken on a wrist action shaker for ten minutes (approximately 1-1/4-inch
 motion at 240 shakes/minute). The shaken mass is then transferred without touching,
 to a tared container and weighed. Results are reported as the amount (number of times
 its own weight) the fibers are able to absorb.
 5
 Moisture content: Ten grams of fiber are weighed and placed in a 250 ºF (121ºC)
 forced air oven for two hours. The sample is then reweighed immediately upon
 removal from the oven.

 1002.02.5.2 Mineral Fiber: When mineral fiber is used, a cationic sizing
 will be required. Introduce the cationic sizing at rates recommended by the
 manufacturer to ensure proper dispersion of the fibers. Comply with the
 following:

 1Tank mixers are required. Submit written documentation of tank cleaning annually to the Materials
 Laboratory. Submit written certificates of analysis from the asphalt binder supplier confirming rubber
 source and size distribution of rubber used. Furnish to the Materials Laboratory.
 2The rotational viscosity will be measured to determine product uniformity. The rotational viscosity
 measured by the supplier shall be noted on the Certificate of Delivery. A binder having a rotational
 viscosity of 3.0 Pa·s or less will typically have adequate mixing and pumping capabilities. Binders with
 rotational viscosity values higher than 3.0 Pa·s should be used with caution and only after consulting with
 the supplier as to any special handling procedures and guarantees of mixing and pumping capabilities.

 all polymers are soluble in the specified solvents. If the polymer modified asphalt digested in the
 solvent will not pass the filter media, a sample of the base asphalt used in making the polymer modified
 asphalt should be tested for solubility. If the solubility of the base asphalt is at least 99.0%, the material
 will be considered as passing.
 4Prepare samples per ASTM D7173. Determine softening point of top and bottom per AASHTO T 53.
 Not required when crumb rubber is used. Separation may be waived for plant blending with the approval
 of the Materials Engineer.

 Aggregates
 1003.01 GENERAL. All aggregates shall be environmentally acceptable
 for the intended use and shall be from an approved SiteManager®
 Producer/Supplier. Additionally stone, gravel, slag, lightweight aggregates,
 and coarse and manufactured sand sources shall be from the Approved
 Materials List. Recycled portland cement concrete (RPCC), reclaimed
 asphalt pavement (RAP), blended calcium sulfate (BCS), and fine natural
 sand are required to be from an approved Producer/Supplier. For source
 approval, comply with the requirements in this subsection and any other
 appropriate section. Provide global positioning coordinates (GPS) for the
 aggregate source site location.
 Unless otherwise defined, coarse aggregates have material predominately
 retained on the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve; fine aggregates have material
 predominately passing the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
 An aggregate material stockpile is either a dedicated stockpile or a
 working (non-dedicated) stockpile. A dedicated stockpile is a stockpile,
 which has been sampled and tested by the Department representative. Once
 approved, it shall not be altered unless the additional material has been
 sampled, tested, and approved. For non-dedicated or working stockpiles, the
 contractor may add or remove material as needed, provided the quality and
 gradation is maintained.

 1003.01.3 Recycled, Reclaimed and Synthetic Aggregates:
 1003.01.3.1 Recycled Portland Cement Concrete, (RPCC):
 RPCC shall be from an approved source listed in the SiteManager®
 Producer/Supplier List. RPCC shall be crushed portland cement concrete
 screened and/or graded to meet the requirements of the specification for the
 intended use. For source approval, the raw material feedstock, the crushing
 operation, the quality control program, and the stockpiles will be inspected
 and approved by the District Laboratory Engineer. Quality must be
 maintained in order to retain source approval status. RPCC used for
 Interstate projects shall be stored in dedicated stockpiles used solely for one
 specific project. The RPCC for non-Interstate projects shall be stored in
 working stockpiles that are separate, identifiable, and have a minimum
 quantity of 5000 cubic yards. Stockpiles shall be reasonably free of asphalt
 concrete overlay material, reinforcing steel, joint material, base course
 material and other debris. If the Project Engineer certifies that the stockpile
 contains RPCC exclusively from DOTD pavements or structures, the
 Magnesium Sulfate soundness testing may be waived by the Materials
 Engineer Administrator.
 1003.01.3.2 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement, (RAP): RAP shall be
 from an approved source listed in the SiteManager® Producer/Supplier List.
 Mill or crush RAP in accordance with Section 509 and store in working
 stockpiles. Stockpiled materials shall be uniform and reasonably free of
 lightweight aggregate, debris, soil, and other foreign matter.
 1003.01.3.3 Blended Calcium Sulfate, (BCS): BCS, a synthetic
 aggregate, shall be from an approved source listed in the SiteManager®
 Producer/Supplier List. The quality control program shall be approved by
 the Materials and Testing Section. The source shall provide documentation
 as evidence that the Department of Environmental Quality has given
 environmental clearance specifically for the intended use. Material pH shall
 953
 
 be a minimum of 5.0 when tested in accordance with DOTD TR 122. BCS
 may be blended at the source with an approved limestone or lime to meet pH
 requirements. The blended material shall be non-plastic and reasonably free
 from organic and foreign matter. Samples shall be taken from a dedicated
 stockpile at the point of origin and tested for gradation in accordance with
 DOTD TR 113.
 1003.01.4 Properties for Portland Cement Concrete
 Aggregates: For source approval, aggregates will be evaluated for both
 alkali silica and alkali carbonate reactivity.
 1003.01.4.1 Alkali Silica Reactivity (ASR) of Sands and
 Gravels in Portland Cement Concrete: For source approval,
 aggregates for use in portland cement concrete are tested for alkali silica
 reactivity properties in accordance with ASTM C289. Aggregates
 categorized as “innocuous” (non-reactive) are allowed without restriction.
 Aggregates categorized as “potentially deleterious” or “deleterious” by
 ASTM C289 may be further appraised by ASTM C1260 testing, modified to
 use a minimum 0.53 water cement ratio and a portland cement from the
 Department’s Approved Materials List. If ASTM C1260 then designates
 aggregates as “potentially deleterious,” (less than 0.2 percent expansion)
 then use the maximum cementitious material substitutions as allowed in
 Section 901 for mixes incorporating these “potentially deleterious”
 aggregates. If a fly ash binary mix is selected, the fly ash must be class F.
 Alternatively, AASHTO PP65-11 may be applied to define ASR potential
 for gravel and sand for concrete mixtures. Concrete mixtures shall refrain
 from incorporating aggregates designated as “ASR deleterious.”
 1003.01.4.2 Alkali Carbonate Reactivity (ACR) and Alkali
 Silica Reactivity (ASR) of Limestone in Portland Cement
 Concrete: For source approval, limestone aggregates for use in portland
 cement concrete will be evaluated for alkali carbonate reactivity (ACR) and
 alkali silica reactivity (ASR) utilizing AASHTO PP65-11. Aggregates
 determined to be innocuous (non-reactive) are allowed without
 restriction. For those aggregates determined to be potentially “ASR
 reactive,” use the maximum cementitious material substitutions as allowed
 in Section 901 for mixes incorporating these ASR reactive aggregates. If a
 fly ash binary mix is selected, the fly ash must be class F. Concrete mixtures
 shall refrain from incorporating limestone aggregates designated as “ASR
 deleterious.” Concrete mixtures shall not incorporate aggregates designated
 as “ACR reactive.”
 
 954
 
 1003.01.4.3 Organic Impurities in Fine Aggregate for
 Portland Cement Concrete: For source approval, fine aggregate for
 portland cement concrete is tested for organic impurities in accordance with
 AASHTO T 21. If the color is darker than the Organic Color No. 3 when
 tested, the fine aggregate is then tested in accordance with AASHTO T 71
 for mortar strength. The measured compressive mortar strength shall be at
 least 95 percent of the referenced compressive mortar strength.
 1003.02 NONPLASTIC EMBANKMENT. The maximum organic
 content is 4.0 percent when tested in accordance with DOTD TR 413.
 1003.02.1 Sand: Sand embankment shall be nonplastic material with
 at least 75 percent passing the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve and not more than 15
 percent passing the No. 200 (75 μm) sieve when tested in accordance with
 DOTD TR 112 and DOTD TR 113.
 1003.02.2 Stone: Stone shall be a coarse stone from the Approved
 Materials List. Comply with the following gradation:
