 PART 00100 - GENERAL CONDITIONS
 Section 00110 - Organization, Conventions, Abbreviations, and Definitions
 Organization
 00110.00 Organization of Specifications - The Specifications are comprised of the following:
 • The "2018 Oregon Standard Specifications for Construction", which contain Part 00100
 "General Conditions", which deal with the solicitation process and contractual relationships and
 Parts 00200 through 03000 which contain the detailed "Technical Specifications" involved in
 prosecution of the Work, organized by subject matter; and
 • The Special Provisions.
 In addition, throughout the Specifications:
 • Each Part is divided into Sections and Subsections.
 • Reference to a Section includes all applicable requirements of the Section.
 • When referring to a Subsection, only the number of the Subsection is used; the word
 "Subsection" is implied.
 • Where Section and Subsection numbers are not consecutive, the interval has been reserved
 for use in the Special Provisions or future expansion of the Standard Specifications.
 Conventions
 00110.05 Conventions Used throughout the Specifications Include:
 (a) Grammar - The "2018 Oregon Standard Specifications for Construction", Part 00100
 "General Conditions", is written in the indicative mood, in which the subject is expressed. Parts
 00200 through 03000, the detailed "Technical Specifications", are generally written in the
 imperative mood, in which the subject is implied. Therefore, throughout Parts 00200 through
 03000, and on the Plans:
 • The subject, "the Contractor", is implied.
 • "Shall" refers to action required of the Contractor, and is implied.
 • "Will" refers to decisions or actions of the Agency and/or the Engineer.
 • The following words, or words of equivalent meaning, refer to the actions of the Agency
 and/or the Engineer, unless otherwise stated: "allowed", "directed", "established",
 "permitted", "ordered", "designated", "prescribed", "required", "determined".
 • The words "approved", "acceptable", "authorized", "satisfactory", "suitable", "considered",
 and "rejected", "denied", "disapproved", or words of equivalent meaning, mean by or to the
 Agency and/or the Engineer, subject in each case to Section 00150 of the General
 Conditions.
 • The words "as shown", "shown", "as indicated", or "indicated" mean "as indicated on the
 Plans".
 • Certain Subsections labeled "Payment" contain statements to the effect that "payment will
 be made at the Contract amounts for the following items" (followed by a list of items). In
 such cases the Agency shall pay for only those Pay Items listed in the Schedule of Items.
 
 1
 
 00110.10
 (b) Capitalization of Terms - Capitalized terms, other than titles, abbreviations, and
 grammatical usage, indicate that they have been given a defined meaning in the Standard
 Specifications. Refer to Section 00110.20 "Definitions". Defined terms will always be capitalized
 in Part 00100; in Parts 00200 through 03000, defined terms will generally not be capitalized, with
 the notable exception of "the Contractor", "the Agency", and "the Engineer".
 (c) Punctuation - In this publication the "outside method" of punctuation is employed for
 placement of the comma and the period with respect to quotation marks. Only punctuation that is
 part of the quoted matter is placed within quotation marks.
 (d) References to Laws, Acts, Regulations, Rules, Ordinances, Statutes, Orders, and
 Permits - References are made in the text of the Specifications to "laws", "acts", "rules",
 "statutes", "regulations", "ordinances", etc. (collectively referred to for purposes of this Subsection
 as "Law"), and to "orders" and "permits" (issued by a governmental authority, whether local, state,
 or federal, and collectively referred to for purposes of this Subsection as "Permits"). Reference is
 also made to "applicable laws and regulations". The following conventions apply in interpreting
 these terms, as used in the Specifications.
 • Statutes and Rules - Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) and Oregon Administrative Rules
 (OAR) referenced in the Specifications are accessible on line, including through the Oregon
 Legislative Counsel Committee website (see 00110.05(e)) and through the Oregon
 Secretary of State Archives Division website (see 00110.05(e)).
 • Law - In each case, unless otherwise expressly stated therein, the Law is to be understood
 to be the current version in effect. This also applies where a specific Law is referenced or
 cited, regardless of whether the text of the Law has been included in the Specifications or
 not, and regardless of whether the text of the Law has been summarized or paraphrased.
 In each case, the current version of the Law is applicable under any contract. The reader is
 therefore cautioned to check the actual text of the Law to confirm that the text included in
 the Specifications has not been modified or superseded.
 • Permits - Orders and permits issued by a government agency may be modified during the
 course of performing the work under a contract. Therefore, wherever the term "order" or
 "permit" is used in the Specifications, it is intended to refer to the then-current version. That
 version may be embodied in a modified, superseding order or permit, or it may consist of all
 terms and conditions of prior orders or permits that have not been superseded, as well as
 the additional terms added by amendment or supplement. In certain cases, the orders
 and/or permits are identified by name in the Specifications; in other cases the terms are
 used in the generic sense. The reader is cautioned to check the text(s) of each order and
 permit identified either by name or by generic reference.
 • Applicable Laws and Regulations - Where the phrase "applicable laws and regulations"
 appears, it is to be understood as including all applicable laws, acts, regulations,
 administrative rules, ordinances, statutes, and orders and permits issued by a governmental
 or regulatory authority.
 (e) Reference to Websites - For Specifications that reference this Subsection, the Agency will
 identify the website addresses in the Special Provisions.
 Abbreviations

 00120.17 Use of Agency-Owned Land for Staging or Storage Areas - The Contractor may use
 Agency-owned property for staging or storage areas, subject to the following limitations:
 (a) Within Normal Right-of-Way Limits - If approved by the Engineer, the Contractor may use
 available property within the normal Right-of-Way limits for the purpose of constructing
 improvements under the Contract. Where the Agency owns, or has rights to, other adjacent
 properties in the Project area, "normal Right-of-Way" is limited to a line drawn across that
 property connecting the normal Right-of-Way limits on either side of the property.
 (b) Outside Normal Right-of-Way Limits - The Contractor may not use Agency-owned property
 outside of normal Right-of-Way limits for the Project without the approval of the Engineer.
 If a Bidder obtains approval before submitting a Bid, use of the property will be at no cost to the
 Contractor, or at a cost stated by the Engineer upon granting approval, as confirmed by
 Addendum.
 If approval is not obtained before submitting a Bid, and the Contractor proposes to use
 Agency-owned property outside the normal Right-of-Way limits, then use of the property may be
 approved by the Engineer, but the Contractor will be assessed fair market value, as determined
 by the Engineer, for use of the property.

 Schedule. Payment to the Contractor will be made only for actual quantities of Work performed and
 accepted or Materials furnished and accepted, as required by the Contract. Quantities of Work to
 be performed and Materials to be furnished may each be increased, decreased, or omitted as
 provided in 00120.30 and 00140.30.

 office. If the Agency has retained subsurface samples, they will also be available for inspection.
 Bidders and the Contractor may make arrangements for viewing the samples through the Engineer's
 office.
 The availability of subsurface information from the Agency is solely for the convenience of the
 Bidder and shall not relieve the Bidder or the Contractor of any risk, duty to make examinations and
 investigations as required by 00120.15, or other responsibility under the Contract Documents. It is
 mutually agreed to by all parties that:
 17
 
 00120.30
 • The written report(s) are reference documents and not part of the Contract Documents.
 • The subsurface investigations made by the Agency are for the purpose of obtaining data for
 planning and design of the Project.
 • The data for individual test boring logs apply only to that particular boring and is not intended
 to be conclusive as to the character of any material between or around test borings.
 • If Bidders use this information in preparing a Bid, it is used at their own risk, and Bidders are
 responsible for all conclusions, deductions, and inferences drawn from this information.
 00120.30 Changes to Plans, Specifications, or Quantities before Opening of Bids - The
 Agency reserves the right to issue Addenda making changes or corrections to the Plans,
 Specifications, or quantities. The Agency will provide Addenda only by publishing them on the

 be read publicly at the time and place indicated in the Notice to Contractors and the Bid Booklet.
 Bidders and other interested parties are invited to be present.
 Bids for each Project will be compared on the basis of the total amount of each Bid. The total
 amount of the Bid will be the total sum computed from quantities listed in the Bid Schedule and unit
 prices entered by the Bidder.
 In case of conflict between the unit price and the corresponding extended amount, the unit price
 shall govern, and the Agency may make arithmetic corrections on extension amounts.
 00120.70 Rejection of Non-responsive Bids - A Bid will be considered irregular and will be
 rejected if the irregularity is deemed by the Agency to render the Bid non-responsive. Examples of
 irregularities include, without limitation:

 00120.80 Reciprocal Preference for Oregon Resident Bidders - This Subsection applies only to
 Contracts for Projects financed without federal funds.
 Bidders shall complete the certificate of residency provided by the Agency in the Bid Booklet.
 Failure to properly complete the form will be cause to reject the Bid.
 As used in the certificate of residency and this Subsection, "Resident Bidder" means a Bidder who
 has:
 • Paid unemployment taxes or income taxes in the State of Oregon during any of the
 12 calendar months immediately preceding submission of the Bid;
 • A business address in the State of Oregon; and
 • Certified in the Bid that the Bidder qualifies as a Resident Bidder.
 "Nonresident Bidder" means a Bidder who is not a Resident Bidder as defined above.
 In determining the lowest Bid, the Agency will, for the purpose of awarding the Contract, add a
 percentage increase to the Bid of a Nonresident Bidder equal to the percentage, if any, of the
 preference given to that Bidder in the state in which the Bidder resides (ORS 279A.120). The
 percentage preference applied in each state will be published on or before January 1 of each year
 by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. The Agency may rely on these percentages
 without incurring liability to any Bidder (ORS 279A.120).
 This increase will only be applied to determine the lowest Bid, and will not cause an increase in
 payment to the Contractor after Award of the Contract.
 00120.90 Disqualification of Bidders - The Bid(s) of a disqualified Bidder will be rejected. Any of
 the following reasons is sufficient to disqualify a Bidder:
 • More than one Bid is submitted for the same Work by an Entity under the same or different
 name(s).
 • Evidence of collusion among Bidders. Participants in collusion will be found not responsible,
 and may be subject to criminal prosecution.
 • Any of the grounds for disqualification cited in ORS 279C.440.
 A Bidder will be disqualified if the Bidder has:
 • Not been prequalified as required by 00120.00;
 • Been declared ineligible by the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries under
 ORS 279C.860;
 • Not been registered (licensed) by the Oregon Construction Contractors Board (CCB) or has
 not been licensed by the State Landscape Contractors Board before submitting a Bid
 24
 
 00120.95
 (ORS 279C.365(1)(k), ORS 701.021, ORS 701.026, and ORS 671.530).
 The Bidder's
 registration number and expiration date shall be shown in the Bid form, if requested. Failure to
 furnish the registration number, if requested, will render the Bid non-responsive and subject to
 rejection. (Not required on Federal-aid projects.); or
 • Been determined by the CCB under ORS 701.227 not to be qualified to hold or participate in a
 public contract for a public improvement.
 00120.91 Rejection of Bid on Grounds of Nonresponsibility of Bidder - The Bid of a Bidder
 who is found to be nonresponsible according to the criteria listed in 00130.10 or ORS 279C.375(3)
 will be rejected.
 00120.95 Opportunity for Cooperative Arrangement - The Agency will offer the Contractor and
 its Subcontractors an opportunity to enter into a partnering agreement structured to take advantage
 of the strengths of each organization. The objective of the partnering agreement is the effective and
 efficient completion of the Work, on time and to a standard of quality that will be a source of pride to
 both the Agency and the Contractor. Participation in the program is voluntary and is not a condition
 for Award. An offer to participate should not be included in Bid or Proposal materials. An election
 for a partnering agreement will be included with the Contract Documents to be executed by the
 successful Bidder.
 It is intended that the partnering agreement will result in informal agreements that will allow the
 Contract requirements to be achieved effectively and efficiently by both the Contractor and the
 Agency.
 The Agency will make all arrangements for the orientation workshop and will bear the costs of the
 workshop including meals, facilitator, and workshop materials. The Agency and the Contractor will
 bear the salary, transportation, lodging, and other costs of their own personnel. The orientation
 workshop may include key Agency personnel, other stakeholders, key Contractor personnel and key
 Subcontractor personnel. Generally, workshops are limited to about 20 participants. Participants
 will not be available for other duties during this period.
 
 25
 
 00130.00
 Section 00130 - Award and Execution of Contract
 00130.00 Consideration of Bids - After opening and reading Bids, the Agency will check them for
 correct extensions of unit prices and totals. (See 00120.65.) The total of extensions, corrected
 where necessary, will be used by the Agency for Award purposes.
 The Agency reserves the right to waive minor informalities and irregularities, and to reject any or all
 Bids for irregularities under 00120.70 or for good cause after finding that it is in the public interest to
 do so (ORS 279C.395). An example of good cause for rejection in the public interest is the
 Agency's determination that any of the unit Bid prices are significantly unbalanced to the Agency's
 potential detriment. The Agency may correct obvious errors, when the correct information can be
 determined from the face of the document, if it finds that the best interest of the Agency and the
 public will be served thereby.
 Bids will be considered and a Contract awarded, if at all, within 30 Calendar Days from the date of
 Bid Opening, unless an extension beyond that time is agreed to by both parties and acknowledged
 in writing by the Bidder.
 00130.10 Award of Contract - After the Bids are opened and a determination is made that a
 Contract is to be awarded, the Contract will be awarded to the lowest responsible Bidder. For the
 purposes of this Section, "lowest responsible Bidder" means the responsible Bidder who submitted
 the lowest responsive Bid, who is not on the list created by the Construction Contractors Board
 according to ORS 701, and who has:
 • Substantially complied with all prescribed public bidding procedures and requirements.
 • Available the appropriate financial, Materials, Equipment, facility and personnel resources and
 expertise, or ability to obtain the resources and expertise, necessary to indicate the capability
 of the prospective Bidder to meet all contractual responsibilities.
 • A satisfactory record of performance. In evaluating a Bidder's record of performance, the
 Agency may consider, among other things, whether the Bidder completed previous contracts
 of a similar nature with a satisfactory record of performance. For purposes of evaluating a
 Bidder's performance on previous contracts of a similar nature, a satisfactory record of
 performance means that to the extent that the costs associated with and time available to
 perform a previous contract remained within the Bidder's control, the Bidder stayed within the
 time and budget allotted for the procurement and otherwise performed the contract in a
 satisfactory manner. Satisfactory performance of the Contract also includes compliance with
 the requirements for records in 00170.07 for Contracts with the Agency.
 • A satisfactory record of integrity. In evaluating a Bidder's record of integrity, the Agency may
 consider, among other things, whether the Bidder has previous criminal convictions for
 offenses related to obtaining or attempting to obtain a contract or subcontract or in connection
 with the Bidder's performance of a contract or subcontract.
 • Qualified legally to contract with the Agency.
 • Supplied all necessary information in connection with the inquiry concerning responsibility. If a
 prospective Bidder fails to promptly supply information requested by the Agency concerning
 responsibility, the Agency will base the determination of responsibility upon any available
 information, or may find the prospective Bidder not to be responsible.
 • Not been disqualified by the public contracting agency under ORS 279C.440.
 • An unexpired certificate issued by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services (under
 ORS 279A.167) upon completion of the curriculum and assessment that the Bidder
 understands the prohibitions set forth in ORS 652.220 and in other laws or rules that prohibit
 discrimination in compensation or wage payment. The certificate is only required if the Bidder
 
 26
 
 00130.40
 employs 50 or more full-time workers and submitted a Bid for a procurement with an estimated
 contract price that exceeds $500,000.
 If the Bidder is found not to have a satisfactory record of performance or integrity, the Agency will
 document the record and the reasons for the unsatisfactory finding.
 The Agency will provide Notice of Intent to Award on the ODOT Procurement Office - Construction
 Contracts Unit Notice of Intent website (see 00110.05(e)).
 The Award will not be final until the later of the following:
 • Three working days after the Notice of Intent to Award has been posted as specified in the
 advertised solicitation or Addendum thereto; or
 • The Agency has provided a written response to each timely protest, denying the protest and
 affirming the Award.
 If the Agency accepts a Bid and awards a Contract, the Agency will send the successful Bidder
 written notice of acceptance and Award.
 Notice of Award and Contract booklets ready for execution will be sent within 30 Calendar Days of
 the opening of Bids or within the number of Calendar Days specified in the Special Provisions or a
 written mutual agreement.
 00130.15 Right to Protest Award - Adversely affected or aggrieved Bidders, limited to the three
 apparent lowest Bidders and any other Bidder directly in line for Contract Award, may submit to the
 ODOT Procurement Office - Construction Contracts Unit a written protest of the Agency's intent to
 Award within 3 working days following posting of the Notice of Intent to Award on the ODOT
 Procurement Office - Construction Contracts Unit Notice of Intent website (see 00110.05(e)). The
 protest shall specify the grounds upon which it is based.
 The Agency is not obligated to consider late protests.
 00130.20 Cancellation of Award - Without liability to the Agency, the Agency may for good cause
 cancel Award at any time before the Contract is executed by all parties to the Contract, as provided
 by ORS 279C.395 for rejection of Bids, upon finding it is in the public interest to do so.
 00130.30 Contract Booklet - The Contract booklet may include, but is not limited to:
 • Special Provisions
 • Addenda
 • Schedule of Items
 • Contract
 • Performance Bond
 • Payment Bond
 • Certification of workers' compensation coverage
 00130.40 Contract Submittals - Before the Agency will execute the Contract, the successful
 Bidder shall furnish the following:
 (a) Performance and Payment Bonds - When Awarded the Contract, the successful Bidder
 shall furnish a Performance Bond and a Payment Bond of a Surety authorized to do business in
 the State of Oregon.
 27
 
 00130.40
 The successful Bidder shall submit the standard bond forms, which are bound in the Contract
 booklet. Faxed or photocopied bond forms will not be accepted. The amount of each bond shall
 be equal to the Contract Amount. The Performance Bond and the Payment Bond must be signed
 by the Surety's authorized Attorney-in-Fact, and the Surety's seal must be affixed to each bond.
 A power of attorney for the Attorney-in-Fact shall be attached to the bonds in the Contract
 booklet, which must include bond numbers, and the Surety's original seal must be affixed to the
 power of attorney. Bonds shall not be canceled without the Agency's consent, nor will the
 Agency normally release them, prior to Contract completion.
 When a coating system warranty is required by 00594.75, the Contractor shall also furnish a
 supplemental warranty performance bond as and when described in 00594.75.
 (b) Certificates of Insurance - The successful Bidder shall furnish the Agency certificates of
 insurance applicable to the Project, according to 00170.70. The insurance coverages shall
 remain in force throughout the performance of the Contract and shall not be allowed to lapse
 without prior written approval of the Agency. Bidders may refer to 00170.70 for minimum
 coverage limits and other requirements.
 For specified Contracts, certified copies, and in some instances the original, of insurance policies
 may be required by the Special Provisions.
 (c) Workers' Compensation - To certify compliance with the workers' compensation insurance
 coverage required by 00170.61(a) and 00170.70(d), the successful Bidder shall complete and
 sign the "Certification of Workers' Compensation Coverage" form bound in the Contract booklet.
 (d) Registration Requirements:
 (1) ORS 701.021, ORS 701.026, and ORS 671.530 require that Bidders be registered with the
 Oregon Construction Contractors Board or licensed by the State Landscape Contractors Board
 prior to submission of a Bid on a Project not involving federal funds. Registration with the
 Construction Contractors Board or licensing by the State Landscape Contractors Board is not
 a prerequisite to bidding on Federal-aid Projects; however, the Agency will not execute a
 Contract until the Contractor is so registered or licensed.
 (2) Bidders must be registered with the Corporation Division, Oregon Secretary of State, if
 bidding as a corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, or limited liability partnership,
 or if operating under an assumed business name and the legal name of each person carrying
 on the business is not included in the business name.
 (3) A Contractor registered under ORS 701 may bid on a landscaping project or perform a
 construction project that includes landscape contracting as a portion of the project if the
 landscape contracting is subcontracted to a licensed landscaping business as defined in
 ORS 671.520.
 (4) A landscaping business may bid on a Project or perform a Contract that includes the
 phase of landscape contracting for which it is not licensed if it employs a landscape contractor,
 or subcontracts with another licensed landscaping business, licensed for that phase.
 (e) Tax Identification Number - The successful Bidder shall furnish the Agency the Bidder's
 Federal Tax Identification Number.
 
 28
 
 00130.80
 00130.50 Execution of Contract and Bonds:
 (a) By the Bidder - The successful Bidder shall deliver the required number of Contract booklets
 with the properly executed Contract, Performance Bond, Payment Bond, certification of workers'
 compensation coverage, and the required certificates of insurance, to the ODOT Procurement
 Office - Construction Contracts Unit within 15 Calendar Days after the date on which the Contract
 booklets are sent or otherwise conveyed to the Bidder under 00130.10. The Bidder shall return
 the originals of all documents received from the Agency and named in this Subsection, with
 original signatures. Certificates of insurance shall also be originals. Certificates of insurance for
 coverages that are permitted by the Agency under 00170.70(a) to be obtained by appropriate
 Subcontractors shall be delivered by the Contractor to the Agency together with the Contractor's
 request under 00180.21 for approval of the subcontract with that Subcontractor. No copies of
 these documents will be accepted by the Agency.
 Proper execution requires that:
 • If the Contractor is a partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, or limited liability
 company, an authorized representative of each Entity comprising it shall sign the Contract,
 Performance Bond, and Payment Bond, and an authorization to sign shall be attached.
 • If the Contractor is a corporation, the President and the Secretary of that corporation shall
 sign the Contract, Performance Bond, and Payment Bond. However, if other corporate
 officers are authorized to execute contracts and bonds, the successful Bidder shall furnish
 with those documents a certified, true and correct copy of the corporate bylaws or minutes
 stating that authority. If only one officer is signing, then the bylaws or minutes must include
 the authority to sign without the signature of others. The successful Bidder shall also
 include the title(s) or corporate office(s) held by the signer(s).
 (b) By the Agency - Within 7 Calendar Days after the Agency has received and verified the
 properly executed documents specified in 00130.50(a), and received legal sufficiency approval
 from the Attorney General (if required), the Agency will execute the Contract. The Agency will
 then send a fully-executed original Contract booklet to the successful Bidder, who then officially
 becomes the Contractor.
 00130.60 Failure to Execute Contract and Bonds - Failure of the successful Bidder to execute
 the Contract and provide the required certificates, certifications, and bonds may be cause for
 cancellation of the Award, and may be cause for forfeiture of the Bid guaranty under
 ORS 279C.385.
 Award may then be made to the next lowest responsible Bidder, the Project may be re-advertised,
 or the Work may be performed otherwise as the Agency decides.
 The forfeited Bid guaranty will become the Agency's property, not as a penalty but as liquidation of
 damages resulting from the Bidder's failure to execute the Contract and provide the certificates,
 certifications, and bonds as required by these Specifications.
 00130.70 Release of Bid Guaranties - Bid guaranties will be released and checks returned
 7 Calendar Days after Bids are opened, except for those of the three apparent lowest Bidders on
 each Project. The guaranties of the three apparent lowest Bidders will be released and checks
 returned to unsuccessful Bidders within 7 Days of the Agency's execution of the Contract.
 00130.80 Project Site Restriction - Until the Agency sends the Contractor written Notice to
 Proceed with the Work, and the Contractor has filed the public works bonds required in 00170.20,
 the Contractor shall not go onto the Project Site on which the Work is to be done, nor move
 Materials, Equipment, or workers onto that Project Site.
 29
 
 00130.90
 The Contractor will not automatically be entitled to extra compensation because the commencement
 of Work is delayed by failure of the Agency to send the Contract for execution. However, if more
 than 30 Calendar Days elapse between the date the Bid is opened and the date the Agency sends
 the Contract to be executed, the Agency will consider granting an adjustment of time for completion
 of the Work to offset any actual delay to Contract completion resulting directly from delay in
 commencement.
 00130.90 Notice to Proceed - Notice to Proceed will be issued within 5 Calendar Days after the
 Contract is executed by the Agency.
 Should the Agency fail to issue the Notice to Proceed within 5 Calendar Days of Contract execution,
 the Contractor may apply for an adjustment of Contract Time according to 00180.80(c).
 The Engineer will issue a First Notification recording the date the performance of the Contract has
 begun.

 00140.30
 Section 00140 - Scope of Work
 00140.00 Purpose of Contract - The purpose of the Contract is to set forth the rights and
 obligations of the parties and the terms and conditions governing completion of the Work. The
 Contractor's obligations shall include without limitation the following:
 • The Contractor shall furnish all Materials, Equipment, labor, transportation, and Incidentals
 required to complete the Work according to Plans, Specifications, and terms of the Contract.
 • The Contractor shall perform the Work according to the lines, grades, Cross Section data,
 Typical Sections, dimensions, and other details shown on the Plans or in the 3D Engineered
 Model, as modified by written order, or as directed by the Engineer.
 • The Contractor shall perform all Work determined by the Engineer to be necessary to complete
 the Project.
 • The Contractor shall contact the Engineer for any necessary clarification or interpretation of the
 Contract.
 00140.10 Typical Sections - The Typical Sections are intended to apply in general. At other
 locations where the Typical Section is not appropriate, the Contractor shall perform construction to
 the identified alignment as directed by the Engineer.
 00140.20 Thickness - The thickness of Courses of Materials shown on the Plans, given in the
 Specifications, or established by the Engineer is considered to be the compacted thickness. Minor
 variations are acceptable when within tolerances specified in the Specifications or Plans, or when
 approved by the Engineer.
 00140.30 Agency-Required Changes in the Work - Changes to the Plans, quantities, or details of
 construction are inherent in the nature of construction and may be necessary or desirable during the
 course of Project construction.
 Without impairing the Contract, the Agency reserves the right to require changes it deems
 necessary or desirable within the scope, which in the Specifications means general scope, of the
 Project. These changes may modify, without limitation:
 • Specifications and design
 • Grade and alignment
 • Cross Sections and thicknesses of Courses of Materials
 • 3D Engineered Model
 • Method or manner of performance of Work
 • Project Limits
 or may result in:
 • Increases and decreases in quantities
 • Additional Work
 • Elimination of any Contract item of Work
 • Acceleration or delay in performance of Work
 Upon receipt of a Change Order, the Contractor shall perform the Work as modified by the Change
 Order. If the Change Order increases the Contract Amount, the Contractor shall notify its Surety of
 the increase and shall provide the Agency with a copy of any resulting modification to bond
 documents. The Contractor's performance of Work according to Change Orders shall neither
 31
 
 00140.40
 invalidate the Contract nor release the Surety. Payment for changes in the Work will be made
 according to 00195.20. Contract Time adjustments, if any, will be made according to 00180.80.
 00140.40 Differing Site Conditions - The following constitute differing Project Site conditions
 provided such conditions are discovered at the Project Site after commencement of the Work:
 • Type 1 - Subsurface or latent physical conditions that differ materially from those indicated in
 the Contract Documents; or
 • Type 2 - Unknown physical conditions of unusual nature that differ materially from those
 ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the Work provided for in the
 Contract.
 The party discovering such a condition shall promptly notify the other party, in writing, of the specific
 differing conditions before they are disturbed and before the affected Work is performed. The
 Contractor shall not continue Work in the affected area until the Engineer has inspected such
 condition according to 00195.30 to determine whether an adjustment to Contract Amount or
 Contract Time is required.
 Payment adjustments due to differing Project Site conditions, if any, will be made according
 to 00195.30. Contract Time adjustments, if any, will be made according to 00180.80.
 00140.50 Environmental Pollution Changes - ORS 279C.525 will apply to any increases in the
 scope of the Work required as a result of environmental or natural resources laws enacted or
 amended after the submission of Bids for the Contract. The Contractor shall comply with the
 applicable notice and other requirements of ORS 279C.525. The applicable rights and remedies of
 that statute will also apply.
 In addition to ORS 279C.525, the Agency has compiled a list at 00170.01 of those federal, State,
 and local agencies, of which the Agency has knowledge, that have enacted ordinances, rules, or
 regulations dealing with the prevention of environmental pollution and the preservation of natural
 resources that may affect the performance of Agency contracts.
 00140.60 Extra Work - If directed by the Engineer's written order, the Contractor shall perform
 work not included in the Contract. The Contractor shall perform this work according to:
 • Standard Specifications
 • Other Plans and Specifications issued by the Engineer
 Payment for Extra Work will be made according to Section 00196. Contract Time adjustments, if
 any, will be made according to 00180.80.
 00140.65 Disputed Work - The Contractor may dispute any part of a Change Order, written order,
 or an oral order from the Engineer by the procedures specified in Section 00199.
 00140.70 Cost Reduction Proposals - The Contractor may submit written proposals to the
 Engineer that modify Plans, Specifications, or other Contract Documents for the sole purpose of
 reducing the total cost of construction. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Agency, a
 proposal that is solely or primarily a proposal to reduce estimated quantities or delete Work, as
 determined by the Engineer, is not eligible for consideration as a cost reduction proposal and will
 instead be addressed under 00140.30, whether proposed or suggested by the Agency or the
 Contractor.
 (a) Proposal Requirements - The Agency will not adopt a cost reduction proposal that impairs
 essential functions or characteristics of the Project, including, but not limited to, service life,
 32
 
 00140.70
 economy of operation, ease of maintenance, designed appearance, or design and safety
 standards.
 To conserve time and funds, the Contractor may first submit a written request for a feasibility
 review by the Engineer. The request should contain a description of the proposal together with a
 rough estimate of anticipated dollar and time savings. The Engineer will, within a reasonable
 time, advise the Contractor in writing whether or not the proposal would be considered by the
 Agency, should the Contractor elect to submit a detailed cost reduction proposal.
 A detailed cost reduction proposal shall include without limitation the following information:
 • A description of existing Contract requirements for performing the Work and the proposed
 change;
 • The Contract items of Work affected by the proposed change, including any quantity
 variation caused by the proposed change;
 • Pay Items affected by the proposed change including any quantity variations;
 • A detailed cost estimate for performing the Work under the existing Contract and under the
 proposed change. Cost estimates shall be made according to Section 00197. Costs of
 re-design, which are incurred after the Agency has accepted the proposal, shall be included
 in the cost of proposed work; and
 • A date by which the Engineer must accept the proposal in order to accept the proposed
 change without impacting the Contract Time or cost reduction amount.
 (b) Continuing to Perform Work - The Contractor shall continue to perform the Work according
 to Contract requirements until the Engineer issues a Change Order incorporating the cost
 reduction proposal. If the Engineer fails to issue a Change Order by the date specified in the
 proposal, the proposal shall be deemed rejected.
 (c) Consideration of Proposal - The Engineer is not obligated to consider any cost reduction
 proposal. The Agency will not be liable to the Contractor for failure to accept or act upon any cost
 reduction proposal submitted.
 The Engineer will determine in its sole discretion whether to accept a cost reduction proposal as
 well as the estimated net savings in construction costs from the adoption of all or any part of the
 proposal. In determining the estimated net savings, the Engineer may disregard the Schedule of
 Items. The Engineer will establish prices that represent a fair measure of the value of Work to be
 performed or to be deleted as a result of the cost reduction proposal.
 (d) Sharing Investigation Costs - As a condition for considering a Contractor's cost reduction
 proposal, the Agency reserves the right to require the Contractor to share in the Agency's costs of
 investigating the proposal. If the Agency exercises this right, the Contractor shall provide written
 acceptance of the condition to the Engineer. Such acceptance will authorize the Agency to
 deduct its share of investigation costs from payments due or that may become due to the
 Contractor under the Contract.
 (e) Acceptance of Proposal Requirements - If the Contractor's cost reduction proposal is
 accepted in whole or in part, acceptance will be made by a Change Order that will include without
 limitation the following:
 • Statement that the Change Order is made according to 00140.70;
 • Revised Contract Documents that reflect all modifications necessary to implement the
 approved cost reduction measures;
 • Any conditions to which the Agency's approval is subject;
 33
 
 00140.80
 • Estimated net savings in construction costs attributable to the approved cost reduction
 measures; and
 • A payment provision according to which the Contractor will be paid 50% of the estimated net
 savings amount as full and adequate consideration for performance of the Work of the
 Change Order.
 The Contractor's cost of preparing the cost reduction proposal and the Agency's costs of
 investigating the proposal, including any portion paid by the Contractor, will be excluded from
 determination of the estimated net savings in construction costs. Costs of re-design, which are
 incurred after the Agency has accepted the proposal, will be included in the cost of the Work
 attributable to cost reduction measures.
 If the Agency accepts the cost reduction proposal, the Change Order that authorizes the cost
 reduction measures will also address any Contract Time adjustment.
 (f) Right to General Use - Once submitted, the cost reduction proposal becomes the property of
 the Agency. The Agency reserves the right to adopt the cost reduction proposal for general use
 without additional compensation to the Contractor when it determines that a proposal is suitable
 for application to other contracts.
 00140.80 Use of Publicly Owned Equipment - The Contractor is prohibited from using
 publicly-owned Equipment except in the case of emergency. In an emergency, the Contractor may
 rent publicly-owned Equipment provided that:
 • The Engineer provides written approval that states that such rental is in the public interest; and
 • Rental does not increase the Project cost.
 00140.90 Final Trimming and Cleanup - Before Final Inspection as described in 00150.90, the
 Contractor shall neatly trim and finish the Project and remove all remaining unincorporated Materials
 and debris. Final trimming and cleanup shall include without limitation the following:
 • The Contractor shall retrim and reshape earthwork, and shall repair deteriorated portions of the
 Project Site.
 • Where the Work has impacted existing facilities or devices, the Contractor shall restore or
 replace those facilities to their pre-existing condition.
 • The Contractor shall clean all drainage facilities and sanitary sewers of excess Materials or
 debris resulting from the Work.
 • The Contractor shall clean up and leave in a neat, orderly condition, Rights-of-Way, Materials
 sites, and other property occupied in connection with performance of the Work.
 • The Contractor shall remove temporary buildings, construction plants, forms, falsework and
 scaffolding, surplus and discarded Materials, and rubbish.
 • The Contractor shall dispose of Materials and debris, including, without limitation, forms,
 falsework, scaffolding, and rubbish resulting from clearing, grubbing, trimming, clean-up,
 removal, and other Work. These Materials and debris become the property of the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall dispose of these Materials and debris immediately.
 Unless the Contract specifically provides for payment for this item, the Agency will make no
 separate or additional payment for final trimming and cleanup.

 arrangement are described in 00120.95. The Contractor may exercise the election to enter into a
 partnering agreement by signing and returning the form provided with the Notice of Award. If the
 Contractor elects to enter into a partnering agreement, this form must be returned no later than the
 time that the Contractor returns the signed Contract to the Agency. This form does not need to be
 returned if the Contractor does not wish to enter into a partnering agreement. Entering into a
 partnering agreement does not constitute nor create a legal partnership, joint venture, other legal
 Entity, or legal relationship between the Contractor and the Agency.
 No partnering agreement shall replace, modify, or suspend the terms of the Contract.
 If the partnering agreement alternative is selected:
 • Within 5 Calendar Days of receipt of the signed form by the Agency, the Contractor and the
 Engineer will identify the key personnel who will participate in the orientation workshop. Key
 personnel should include key Subcontractors and other stakeholders. The Agency will arrange
 the workshop time and location.
 • It is intended that the partnering agreement will result in informal agreements that establish an
 environment of cooperation between the Contractor and the Agency.
 • A working arrangement for the Contractor and the Agency will be developed and, if agreed at
 the workshop, committed to writing.

 (a) Inspection by the Engineer - The Engineer may test Materials furnished and inspect Work
 performed by the Contractor to ensure Contract compliance.
 If the Contractor performs Work without the Engineer's inspection or uses Materials that the
 Engineer has not approved, the Engineer may order affected portions of the Work removed at the
 Contractor's expense. The foregoing sentence shall not apply if the Engineer fails to inspect the
 Work within a specific period of time required in the Contract or, in the absence of a specific
 period of time, within a reasonable period of time after receiving the Contractor's timely written
 request for inspection or testing.
 
 37
 
 00150.25
 At the Engineer's direction, any time before the Work is accepted, the Contractor shall uncover
 portions of the completed Work for inspection. After inspection, the Contractor shall restore these
 portions of Work to the standard required by the Contract. If the Engineer rejects Work due to
 Materials or workmanship, or if the Contractor performed such Work without providing sufficient
 advance request for inspection to the Engineer, the Contractor shall bear all costs of uncovering
 and restoring the Work.

 The Contractor shall identify if the material source is a DBE or non-DBE. For DBE Suppliers, the
 Contractor shall identify an estimated value of the materials to be supplied. For each committed
 DBE Supplier, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the materials purchase order or supply
 agreement. For non-committed DBE suppliers, when the estimated value is over $10,000, the
 Contractor shall submit a copy of the materials purchase order or supply agreement.
 For this purpose, a committed DBE firm is one that was identified by the Contractor to meet an
 assigned DBE goal, including DBE firms substituting for DBE firms committed as a condition of
 Contract Award.
 (b) Prospective Source Materials - When given an option to use Prospective Sources of
 Materials to be incorporated into the Work, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing of
 the option selected within 15 Calendar Days from date of Notice to Proceed. Otherwise, such
 Materials sources may become unavailable.
 (c) Approval Required - Before allowing production or delivery of Materials to begin from any
 source, the Contractor must obtain the Engineer's approval. Approval to use any source does not
 imply that Materials from that source will be accepted. If approved sources do not provide
 Materials that meet Specifications, the Materials will be rejected. The Contractor will then be
 responsible for locating other sources and obtaining the Engineer's approval.
 (d) Terms Required - The Contractor shall comply with 00170.07.
 00160.05 Qualified Products List (QPL) - The QPL is a listing of manufactured products available
 on the market (shelf items) that ODOT has evaluated and found suitable for a specified use in
 highway construction.
 The QPL is available from ODOT's Construction Section website
 (see 00110.05(e)).
 The most current published PDF version of the QPL on ODOT's Construction Section website at the
 time of Advertisement is the version in effect for the Project. When the Contract specifies the use of
 the QPL, unless specified as the subject of an exemption per ORS 279C.345, the Agency may
 approve for use a conditionally qualified product, a product qualified for inclusion in a later edition of
 47
 
 00160.10
 the QPL, or other equivalent product that meets the requirements of the QPL, following the Standard
 Guidelines for Product Review, if the Agency finds the product acceptable for use on the Project.
 Use of listed products shall be restricted to the category of use for which they are listed. The
 Contractor shall install all products as recommended by the manufacturer. The Contractor shall
 replace qualified products not conforming to Specifications or not properly handled or installed at no
 additional cost to the Agency.
 00160.10 Ordering, Producing, and Furnishing Materials - The Contractor shall not place orders
 for or produce full quantities of Materials anticipated to be required to complete the Work until the
 Work has advanced to a stage that allows the quantities to be determined with reasonable accuracy.
 Upon request, the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the quantities required. Quantity
 estimates by the Engineer before this notification are only approximate.
 (a) Contractor's Duties - In purchasing, producing, or delivering Materials, the Contractor shall
 take into account the following:
 • Kind of work involved;
 • Amount of work involved;
 • Time required to obtain Materials; and
 • Other relevant factors.
 (b) Approval of Quantity of Materials Ordered - Materials quantities shown on the Plans, or
 indicated by quantities and Pay Items, are subject to change or elimination. Therefore, the
 Contractor is cautioned to order or produce Materials only after having received the approval of
 the Engineer. The Contractor is responsible for payment for excess Materials delivered to the
 Project Site or storage sites without advance authorization from the Engineer. Unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract, the Agency will not be responsible for:
 • Materials the Contractor may deliver or produce in excess of Contract requirements;
 • Extra expense the Contractor may incur because Materials were not ordered or produced
 earlier; or
 • The Contractor's expenses related to Materials ordered by the Contractor that are not
 subsequently approved for use.
 Excess Materials ordered or produced by the Contractor without approval of the Engineer may be
 purchased by the Agency at the sole discretion of the Agency. (See 00195.80.)
 00160.20 Preferences for Materials:
 (a) Buy America - If federal highway funds are involved on the Project, the Contractor shall limit
 the quantity of foreign Materials incorporated into the Work as follows. Section 635.410 of

 development plan will be included in Section 00235 of the Special Provisions when such sources
 are shown on the Plans.
 (a) Working in a Different Area of the Materials Source - If the Contractor desires to work in a
 different area of the Materials source than that shown on the development plan, the Contractor
 must submit a written request stating the reasons for the requested change. If a new land use
 permit, development plan, or reclamation plan is needed, the Contractor must submit it and obtain
 49
 
 00160.50
 approval from the Engineer before starting work in any area other than that shown on the Plans.
 Approval for work in a different area will not entitle the Contractor to any added compensation or
 adjustment of Contract Time.
 The Agency will not be responsible for the availability of sources other than as stated in the
 Special Provisions. If the Contractor has given notice of intent to use, but does not use the
 source(s) on the Project, the Contractor shall reimburse the Agency for any costs the Agency
 incurs in making such source(s) available.
 (b) Cost of Sources - Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, any Prospective or
 Mandatory Source will be provided by the Agency for use without payment of royalty or other
 charge. (See 00160.50.)
 (c) Exhaustion of Sources - If the Engineer determines that the quantities of specified Materials
 that can be produced from a Mandatory Source are insufficient for the Work, and it becomes
 necessary to move to another source, the Agency will pay for the reasonable cost of moving the
 plant to, and erecting it at, a new approved source from which specified Materials can be
 produced. Adjustment in hauling costs, other costs, and Contract Time will be determined as
 provided in 00140.30.
 No allowance, reimbursement, compensation, or adjustment will be made for changes in the use
 of sources, or for moving from one source to another, except as provided above.
 00160.50 Agency-Controlled Land; Limitations and Requirements:
 (a) General - The Contractor shall have no property rights in, or right of occupancy on,
 Agency-Controlled Land. Nor shall the Contractor have the right to sell, use, remove, or

 • Permit positive determination that Material delivered to the Project is the same Material
 covered by the certificate,
 • Be delivered to the Engineer with the shipment of the Material, or be an identification plate
 or mark, decal, sticker, label, or tag attached to the container or Material,
 (c) Equipment List and Drawings - These consist of lists of proposed Equipment and Materials,
 such as:
 • Shop drawings
 • Material lists
 • Equipment lists
 • Catalog description sheets
 • Manufacturer's brochures
 Submit these lists to the Engineer for review of conformance with the Specifications.
 (d) Certificate of Origin of Steel Materials - When specified, complete this document (ODOT
 Form 734-2126) as required by 00160.20 for Federal-aid projects.
 Materials will be subject to acceptance testing if the Engineer so elects. The Engineer may reject
 damaged or non-specification materials regardless of the Materials Conformance Documents
 furnished.
 00165.40 Statistical Analysis - When 00165.30(c) or 00165.50 applies, the Contractor shall divide
 the Materials into lots and sublots, randomly sample and test them as required, and analyze the
 results statistically to determine whether the Materials conform to the Specifications.
 All acceptance test results of lots and sublots will be analyzed collectively using the Quality Level
 Analysis procedure set out in this Subsection. This procedure shall not be used for a lot with less
 than three sublots. Sampling of Material for a lot that contains two or fewer sublots shall be
 increased to obtain at least three sublots. The Engineer has discretion to either accept or reject lots
 originating with two or fewer sublots, even after sampling is increased.
 (a) Lot - A lot is the quantity of Materials produced by a single process or JMF that is sampled,
 tested, and statistically evaluated, as specified in this Subsection.
 (b) Sublot - A sublot is a portion of a lot, for which a sample test value may be normally
 obtained.
 (c) Quality Level Analysis - Quality Level Analysis is a statistical procedure to determine, for
 each lot:
 • The percentage of each constituent of the Materials meeting Specifications;
 • The Pay Factor for each constituent; and
 • The Composite Pay Factor, when specified.
 (d) Pay Factor and Composite Pay Factor Computation - Procedures for determining the
 percent meeting Specifications, Pay Factors, and Composite Pay Factor for a lot of Materials are
 as follows:
 
 56
 
 00165.40
 (1) Compute lot arithmetic mean ( X ) for each constituent:
 X
 X = n
 Where X = summation of sample test values
 n = total number of samples
 (2) Compute standard deviation (sd) for each constituent:
 
 sd =
 2
 Where  X
 
 X
 
  X2  n X
 n 1
 
 2
 
 = summation of the squares of each sample test value
 
 2
 
 = square of the lot arithmetic mean
 
 (3) Compute the upper quality index (QU) for each constituent:
 
 QU
 
 USL  X
 sd
 =
 
 Where USL (upper specification limit) is the target value plus allowable tolerance
 (4) Compute the lower quality index (QL) for each constituent:
 
 X  LSL
 sd
 QL =
 Where LSL (lower specification limit) is the target value minus allowable tolerance
 (5) From Table 00165-1, for each constituent, determine the percent within the upper
 specification limit (PU) which corresponds to a given QU. If USL is 100% or is not specified, PU
 will be 100.
 (6) From Table 00165-1, for each constituent, determine the percent within the lower
 specification limit (PL) which corresponds to a given QL. If LSL is 0 or not specified, PL will be
 100.
 (7) Compute the quality level, or total percent within specification limits (PT), for each
 constituent:
 
 PT = (PU + PL) - 100
 (8) Using the PT from Step 7, determine the Pay Factor (PF) from Table 00165-2 for each
 constituent tested. A minimum PF of 1.00 will be used when all sublot test values are within
 the upper and lower specification limits, regardless of the calculated PF.
 
 57
 
 00165.40
 (9) Compute the Weighted Pay Factor (WPF) for each constituent:
 
 WPF = (PF) x (fi)
 Where fi = weighting factor listed in the Specifications for each constituent tested.
 (10) Compute the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) for the lot and report the results to three
 decimal places.
  WPF
  fi
 CPF =
 
 Where  WPF = sum of the weighted pay factors for each constituent
  f i = sum of the weighting factors listed in the Specifications

 00165.50
 00165.50 Statistical Acceptance Sampling and Testing - The Contractor shall sample and test
 Materials for acceptance, as required by the Contract. The Contractor may statistically evaluate test
 results for purposes of quality control or to predict a Pay Factor or Composite Pay Factor. The
 following apply:
 (a) Statistical Acceptance - The Engineer will perform statistical analysis according to 00165.40
 for acceptance and to determine a Pay Factor (PF) or Composite Pay Factor (CPF). The
 Engineer's determination of the PF or CPF shall be controlling.
 (b) Pay Adjustments - As an incentive to produce quality Materials, the Engineer's acceptance
 will be based upon the following:
 (1) Specification Materials - For Materials accepted by a PF, when all constituents of a
 Material have a PF of 1.00 or greater, that Material will be considered specification Materials.
 For Materials accepted by a CPF, all Materials with a CPF of 1.0000 or greater will be
 considered specification Materials. Materials with a CPF greater than 1.0000, when specified,
 may earn a CPF adjustment of greater than 1.0000, up to a maximum of 1.0500.
 (2) Non-specification Materials - For Materials accepted by a PF, when any constituent of a
 Material has a PF of less than 1.00, that Material will be considered non-specification Material.
 For Materials accepted by a CPF, all Materials with a CPF less than 1.0000 will be considered
 non-specification Materials. A lot containing non-specification Materials will be evaluated as
 described in 00165.50(c).
 (c) Non-specification Materials:
 (1) Isolation of a Partial Sublot - The Engineer may isolate from a sublot or adjoining sublots
 any Material that the Contractor's test results show to be non-specification. The Contractor
 shall perform additional testing or provide samples to the Agency as directed. The Engineer
 will accept or reject the Material according to 00150.25.
 (2) Isolation of an Entire Sublot - The Engineer may isolate a sublot or a series of sublots in
 which the Contractor's test results show the Material to be non-specification. The Contractor
 shall perform additional testing or provide samples to the Agency as directed. The isolated
 Material will be evaluated as a separate lot. The Engineer will accept or reject the Material
 according to 00150.25.
 (3) A Lot-in-Progress - The Contractor shall shut down production when any of the following
 occurs:
 
 • The CPF for a lot-in-progress drops below 1.0000, and the Contractor is taking no
 corrective action;
 • The CPF is less than 0.7500; or
 • Any constituent test is continually out of specification limits, regardless of whether or not
 the CPF is below 0.7500.
 The Contractor shall not resume production until the Engineer has determined that
 Specification Materials can be produced, and has given approval to resume.
 (4) An Entire Lot - The Engineer may reject an entire lot of Materials with a CPF
 between 0.7500 and 1.0000, or may take action according to 00150.25.
 
 For a lot of Material with a CPF below 0.7500, the Engineer will take one or more of the
 following actions:
 63
 
 00165.70
 a. Remain in Place - Allow Materials to remain in place with an appropriate price reduction
 that may range from 25% to 100% (no payment);
 b. Corrective Work - Require corrective work, at the Contractor's expense, with an
 appropriate price reduction that may range from zero (full payment) to 100% (no payment);
 or
 c. Remove and Replace - Require complete removal and replacement with Specification
 Materials. No payment will be made for the rejected Materials, the cost of removal, or for
 the costs of sampling and testing.
 00165.70 Use of Materials without Acceptable Materials Conformance Documents:
 (a) General - The Contractor shall not incorporate Materials into the Project prior to submittal of
 Materials Conformance Documents acceptable to the Engineer. The Engineer may waive this
 requirement temporarily if Materials are necessary for immediate traffic safety.
 (b) Materials Incorporated for Immediate Traffic Safety - If Materials are incorporated into the
 Project for immediate traffic safety before acceptable Materials Conformance Documents are
 available, no payment will be made for the value of the Materials, or the costs of incorporating
 them, until Materials Conformance Documents have been submitted to and approved by the
 Engineer, or the Materials are otherwise found through testing to comply with Specifications.
 (c) Contractor's Request for Testing Assistance - If acceptable Materials Conformance
 Documents are not available, the Contractor may either have the necessary tests performed at a
 private laboratory or request in writing that the Engineer:
 
 • Determine if the Agency or its agents can sample and test;
 • Estimate the cost to the Contractor for the testing service; and
 • Estimate the time required to obtain the test results.
 The Engineer will provide this information to the Contractor in writing. If the Contractor requests
 the Engineer, in writing, to proceed, the Engineer will arrange for the sampling and testing, at the
 Contractor's expense. If these tests determine the Material complies with the Specifications, the
 Materials may be incorporated into the Project, or for Materials previously incorporated according
 to (b) above, payment will be authorized.
 00165.75 Storage and Handling of Materials - The Contractor shall store and handle Materials so
 as to preserve their quality and fitness for incorporation into the Work. The Contractor shall restore
 all storage sites to their original condition according to 00140.90, or to comply with any applicable
 permits, orders, or agreements, at the Contractor's expense.
 
 Stored Materials:
 • Shall be readily accessible for inspection;
 • May be stored on approved parts of the Right-of-Way; and
 • May be stored on private property if written permission of the owner or lessor is obtained.
 Measurement
 00165.80 Measurement - No separate measurement will be made of Work performed under this
 Section.
 
 64
 
 00165.91
 Payment
 00165.90 Incidental Basis - No separate or additional payment will be made for sampling, testing,
 certification, or other associated Work performed under this Section, whether performed by the
 Contractor, manufacturer, producer or Supplier. No payment will be made for providing quality
 control personnel.
 00165.91 Fabrication Inspection Expense - Fabrication of certain items outside of the State
 creates additional shop and plant inspection expense to the Agency. It is impractical, and extremely
 difficult, to determine the actual additional expenses incurred. Therefore, each time that inspection
 by or on behalf of the Agency is necessary, payment to the Contractor will be reduced by an amount
 computed at the following rates:
 Zone
 1
 
 Place of Fabrication
 All of State of Oregon, and those
 portions of adjacent states within 50
 airline miles of the Oregon border
 
 Reduction in Payment
 $0
 
 2
 
 Outside of Zone 1, and up to 300
 airline miles from the Oregon border
 
 $200 per Calendar Day
 
 3
 
 Outside of Zone 2, up to 3,000 airline
 miles from the Oregon border, and
 within the continental United States.
 
 Round trip coach airfare from
 Portland, Oregon plus $200
 per Calendar Day
 
 4
 
 Outside of Zone 3, or outside of the
 continental United States.
 
 Round trip coach airfare from
 Portland, Oregon plus $250
 per Calendar Day
 
 Calendar Day charges begin on the first day the Agency's Inspector begins travel to begin work at
 the fabrication site, and continue without interruption through the final day of travel back to the State.
 The Contractor will be notified in writing of the beginning and ending dates of the Calendar Days
 used in computing payment reduction.
 This Subsection applies to all fabricated items or manufactured Materials that are inspected by or on
 behalf of the Agency, which include, but are not limited to:
 • Structural steel fabrication;
 • Prestressed concrete members;
 • Precast concrete;
 • Signs;
 • Preservative treatment of wood products;
 • Epoxy coating of reinforcing steel; and
 • Other items specifically identified in the Specifications as requiring fabrication site or in-plant
 inspection by the Agency.

 authority, as well as any documents referenced or incorporated therein by reference, shall be
 admissible for the purpose of Contract interpretation.
 The characterization of provisions of the Contract as material provisions or the failure to comply with
 certain provisions as a material breach of the Contract shall in no way be construed to mean that
 any other provisions of the Contract are not material or that failure to comply with any other
 provisions is not a material breach of the Contract.
 All rights and remedies available to the Agency under applicable Laws are incorporated herein by
 reference and are cumulative with all rights and remedies under the Contract.
 The Contract shall not be construed against either party regardless of which party drafted it. Other
 than as modified by the Contract, the applicable rules of contract construction and evidence shall
 apply. This Contract shall be governed by and construed and enforced according to the laws of the
 State of Oregon without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 Any dispute between the Agency and the Contractor that arises from or relates to this Contract and
 that is not resolved under the provisions of Section 00199 shall be brought and conducted solely
 and exclusively within the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon in the county where the Agency's
 main office is located; provided, however, if a dispute must be brought in a federal forum, then it
 shall be brought and conducted solely and exclusively within the United States District Court for the
 District of Oregon. In no event shall this Subsection be construed as a waiver by the State of
 Oregon on any form of defense or immunity, whether sovereign immunity, governmental immunity,
 immunity based on the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or otherwise,
 from any claim or from the jurisdiction of any court. CONTRACTOR BY EXECUTION OF THE
 CONTRACT HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE IN PERSONAM JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS

 general auditing, reviewing claims, checking for collusive bidding, reviewing or checking payment
 of required wages, performance and contract compliance, workplace safety compliance,
 evaluating Related Entities, environmental compliance, and qualifications for performance of the
 Contract, including the ability to perform and the integrity of the Contractor.
 Where such records are stored in a computer or in other digital media, the Engineer may request,
 and the Contractor shall provide, a copy of the data files and such other information or access to
 software to allow the Engineer review of the records.
 Nothing in 00170.07 is intended to operate as a waiver of the confidentiality of any
 communications privileged under the Oregon Evidence Code. Nothing in 00170.07 limits the
 records or documents that can be obtained by legal process.
 (c) Record Retention Period - The Contractor shall maintain the records and keep the records
 accessible and available at reasonable times and places for at least 3 years from the date of final

 through ORS 192.505, the Contractor shall clearly designate on or with the records the portions
 which the Contractor claims are exempt from disclosure, along with a justification and citation to
 the authority relied upon. Entire records or documents should not be designated as a trade
 secret or otherwise exempt from disclosure. Only specific information within a record or
 document should be so designated.
 
 To the extent allowed by the Oregon Public Records Law or other applicable law related to the
 disclosure of public records, the Agency will not disclose records or portions of records the
 Contractor has designated as trade secrets to a third party, who is not a representative of the
 Agency, to the extent the records are exempt from disclosure as trade secrets under the Oregon
 Public Records Law or other applicable law, except to the extent the Agency is ordered to
 disclose in accordance with the Oregon Public Records Law or by a court of competent
 jurisdiction. Application of the Oregon Public Records Law or other applicable law shall
 determine whether any record, document or information is actually exempt from disclosure.
 In addition, in response to a public records request, the Agency will not produce or disclose
 records so identified as exempt by the Contractor to any person other than representatives of the
 Agency, and others with authorized access under 00170.07(b), without providing the Contractor a

 sufficient limits that when added to the Contractor's Commercial General Liability Insurance
 limits the total combined limits of Commercial General Liability Insurance and Excess or
 Umbrella Liability Insurance equal or exceed the above-stated Commercial General Liability
 Insurance limits required for this Project. The above-stated combined single limit per
 occurrence and the above-stated annual aggregate limit must each be met. Excess or
 Umbrella Liability Insurance coverage shall extend to the same perils, terms, and conditions
 as the underlying Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage.
 • Pollution Liability - If indicated by Special Provision, Pollution Liability Insurance covering
 the Contractor's liability, or the liability of an appropriate Subcontractor, if the coverage is
 obtained by the Subcontractor, for bodily injury and property damage, and environmental
 damage resulting from sudden and accidental pollution, gradual pollution, and related
 clean-up costs incurred by the Contractor, or by the Subcontractor if the coverage is
 obtained by the Subcontractor, while performing Work required by the Contract. If the
 coverage is obtained by the Contractor, the coverage may be written in combination with the
 Commercial General Liability Insurance with separate limits for Pollution Liability and
 Commercial General Liability. Combined single limit per occurrence shall not be less than
 the dollar amount indicated in the Special Provisions. The annual aggregate limit shall not
 78
 
 00170.70
 be less than the dollar amount indicated in the Special Provisions. The policy shall be

 separate policy endorsed to state that the annual aggregate limit of liability shall apply
 separately to the Contract.
 • Commercial Automobile Liability - Commercial Automobile Liability Insurance covering all
 owned, non-owned, and hired vehicles. This coverage may be written in combination with
 the Commercial General Liability Insurance with separate limits for Commercial Automobile
 Liability and Commercial General Liability. Combined single limit per occurrence shall not
 be less than the dollar amount indicated in the Special Provisions. If this coverage is written
 in combination with the Commercial General Liability, the policy shall be endorsed to state

 with separate limits for Commercial Automobile Liability with Pollution Coverage and
 Commercial General Liability. Combined single limit per occurrence shall not be less than
 the dollar amount indicated in the Special Provisions or the amount required by the U.S.
 Department of Transportation, whichever is greater. If this coverage is written in
 combination with the Commercial General Liability, the policy shall be endorsed to state that
 the Commercial General Liability annual aggregate limit shall apply separately to the
 Contract.
 Commercial Automobile Liability with Pollution Coverage is required for this Project because
 the Project includes pollution related Work.
 If the Contractor will be performing
 pollution-related Work, this coverage covering the Contractor must be provided. If an
 appropriate Subcontractor, but not the Contractor, will perform the pollution related Work,
 Commercial Automobile Liability with Pollution Coverage covering the Subcontractor, but
 not the Contractor, must be provided, however, the Contractor shall provide Commercial
 Automobile Liability insurance coverage covering the Contractor as provided in the
 Commercial Automobile Liability bullet above. If both the Contractor and an appropriate
 Subcontractor will be performing pollution related Work, Commercial Automobile Liability
 with Pollution Coverage covering both the Contractor and the Subcontractor shall be

 provided, and the Contractor may provide the coverage covering both the Contractor and
 the Subcontractor, or the Contractor and the Subcontractor may provide their own, separate
 Commercial Automobile Liability with Pollution coverages.
 (b) Tail Coverage - If any of the required liability insurance coverages of 00170.70(a) are on a
 "claims made" basis, "tail" coverage will be required at the completion of the Contract for a

 shall keep the coverage in effect for a duration of not less than 24 months from the end of the
 Contract. This will be a condition of Final Acceptance.
 (c) Additional Insured - The liability insurance coverages of 00170.70(a) shall include the

 00180.21 Subcontracting:
 (a) General - The Contractor shall not subcontract or perform any portion of the Contract by
 other than the Contractor's own organization without the Agency's prior written consent. A
 request for consent to subcontract, at any tier, solely for the furnishing of a labor force will not be
 considered.
 
 A written request for consent to subcontract any portion of the Contract at any tier shall be
 submitted to the Engineer, and when required by the Engineer, shall be accompanied by
 background information showing that the organization proposed to perform the Work is
 experienced and equipped for such Work. The Agency will review the Contractor's submission to
 verify compliance with Contract requirements, confirm the percentage of Work subcontracted,
 and evaluate the proposed Subcontractor's ability to perform the Work. If the Agency approves
 the Contractor's request to subcontract, the Agency will provide its consent to the Contractor's
 request as follows:
 • If the Subcontractor is not providing any of the insurance coverages as permitted under
 00170.70(a), the Agency will respond within 7 Calendar Days after the Engineer's receipt of
 the request.
 • If the Subcontractor is providing any of the insurance coverages as permitted under
 00170.70(a), the Agency will respond within 35 Calendar Days after the Engineer's receipt
 of the request. (28 Calendar Days for the Agency to review and approve the Certificates of
 Insurance required by 00170.70(f) plus 7 Calendar Days to review and approve the
 subcontract request.)
 The Engineer may revoke consent to subcontract. If the Engineer revokes consent to
 subcontract, the Subcontractor shall be immediately removed from the Project Site.
 (b) Submittal of Requests - The Contractor must submit requests for consent to subcontract
 any portion of the Contract, at any tier, on the Agency's form, available from the Engineer. The
 Contractor shall attach a duplicate original subcontract agreement. The Contractor must also
 submit in writing any amendments or modifications proposed to Agency-approved subcontract
 agreements, at any tier, before the affected Work begins. The Agency's written consent will be
 required before such amendments or modifications become effective.
 
 The Contractor and proposed Subcontractors shall review the Agency's Conflict of Interest
 Guidelines, and if any disclosures are required, they shall complete the Conflict of Interest
 Disclosure Form(s) and submit them with the request for consent to subcontract. The ODOT
 Conflict of Interest Guidelines and Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form are available on the ODOT
 Procurement Office website (see 00110.05(e)).
 If disclosures are not required under the Agency's Conflict of Interest Guidelines, no disclosures
 need be submitted.
 The Subcontractors shall also otherwise be in compliance with the Agency's Conflict of Interest
 Guidelines. (See 00170.78.)
 (c) Substitution of Disclosed Subcontractors - The Contractor may only substitute a
 previously undisclosed first-tier Subcontractor according to the provisions of ORS 279C.585. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a written notification that identifies the name of the
 proposed new Subcontractor and the reason for the substitution. Authorized reasons for
 substitution are limited to the following circumstances (see ORS 279C.585(1) through
 ORS 279C.585(10)):
 
 91
 
 00180.21
 • The disclosed Subcontractor fails or refuses to execute a written contract that is reasonably
 based either upon the Project Plans and Specifications, or the terms of the Subcontractor's
 written Bid, after having had a reasonable opportunity to do so;
 • The disclosed Subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent;
 • The disclosed Subcontractor fails or refuses to perform the contract;
 • The disclosed Subcontractor fails or refuses to meet the bond requirements of the prime
 Contractor that had been identified prior to the Bid submittal;
 • The Contractor demonstrates to the Agency that the Subcontractor was disclosed as the
 result of an inadvertent clerical error;
 • The disclosed Subcontractor does not hold a license from the Construction Contractors
 Board and is required to be licensed by the board;
 • The Contractor determines that the Work performed by the disclosed Subcontractor is not in
 substantial compliance with the Plans and Specifications, or that the Subcontractor is
 substantially delaying or disrupting the progress of the Work;
 • The disclosed Subcontractor is ineligible to work on a public improvement according to the
 applicable statutory provisions;
 • The substitution is for "good cause" as defined by State Construction Contractors Board
 rule; or
 • The substitution is reasonably based on the Contract alternates chosen by the Agency.
 (d) Terms of Subcontracts - Subcontracts shall provide that work performed under the
 subcontract shall be conducted and performed according to the terms of the Contract.
 Compliance with 00170.07 is required. All subcontracts, including Contractor's with the first-tier
 Subcontractors and those of the first-tier Subcontractors with their Subcontractors, and any other
 lower-tier subcontracts shall contain a clause or condition that if the Contractor or a Subcontractor
 fails, neglects, or refuses to make payment to an Entity furnishing labor or Materials in connection
 with the Contract, the Entity may file a complaint with the Construction Contractors Board, unless
 payment is subject to a good-faith dispute as defined in ORS 279C.580. Additionally, according
 to the provisions of ORS 279C.580, subcontracts shall include:
 (1) A payment clause that obligates the Contractor to pay the first-tier Subcontractor for
 satisfactory performance under the subcontract within 10 Calendar Days out of amounts the
 Agency pays to the Contractor under the Contract.
 (2) A clause that requires the Contractor to provide the first-tier Subcontractor with a standard
 form that the first-tier Subcontractor may use as an application for payment or as another
 method by which the Subcontractor may claim a payment due from the Contractor.
 (3) A clause that requires the Contractor, except as otherwise provided in this Subsection, to
 use the same form and regular administrative procedures for processing payments during the
 entire term of the subcontract. The Contractor may change the form or the regular
 administrative procedures the Contractor uses for processing payments if the Contractor:
 
 • Notifies the Subcontractor in writing at least 45 Calendar days before the date on which
 the Contractor makes the change; and
 • Includes with the written notice a copy of the new or changed form or a description of the
 new or changed procedure.
 (4) An interest penalty clause that obligates the Contractor, if the Contractor does not pay the
 first-tier Subcontractor within 30 Calendar Days after receiving payment from the Agency, to
 pay the first-tier Subcontractor an interest penalty on amounts due in each payment the
 
 92
 
 00180.21
 Contractor does not make in accordance with the payment clause included in the subcontract
 under 00180.21(d)(1). The Contractor or first-tier Subcontractor is not obligated to pay an
 interest penalty if the only reason that the Contractor or first-tier Subcontractor did not make
 payment when payment was due is that the Contractor or first-tier Subcontractor did not
 receive payment from the Agency or the Contractor when payment was due. The interest
 penalty applies to the period that begins on the day after the required payment date and ends
 on the date on which the amount due is paid; and shall be computed at the rate specified
 in 00170.10(c).
 (5) A clause that requires the Contractor's first-tier Subcontractor to include a payment clause
 and an interest penalty clause that conform to the standards of ORS 279C.580
 (see 00180.21(d)(1) and 00180.21(d)(4)) in each of the first-tier Subcontractor's subcontracts
 and to require each of the first-tier Subcontractor's Subcontractors to include such clauses in
 its subcontracts with each lower-tier Subcontractor or Material supplier.
 
 These payment clauses shall require the Contractor to return all retainage withheld from the
 Subcontractor, whether held by the Contractor or the Agency, as specified in 00195.50(d).
 As required by ORS 279C.800 through ORS 279C.870, subcontracts shall include:
 • A provision requiring the Subcontractor to have a public works bond filed with the
 Construction Contractors Board before starting Work on the Project, unless exempt.
 • A provision requiring that the workers shall be paid not less than the specified minimum
 hourly rate of wage.
 As and when applicable, the Contractor shall require in its subcontracts that Subcontractors
 maintain the certifications required by ORS 279A.107.
 (e) Contractor's Responsibilities - As a condition of the Agency's grant of consent to
 subcontract, whether or not stated in the subcontract agreement itself, the Contractor shall
 remain solely responsible for administration of the subcontract, including, but not limited to:
 
 • Performance of subcontracted Work;
 • Progress of subcontracted Work;
 • Payments for accepted subcontracted Work; and
 • Disputes and claims for additional compensation regarding subcontracted Work.
 The Engineer's consent to subcontract will not create a contract between the Agency and the
 Subcontractor, will not convey to the Subcontractor any rights against the Agency, and will not
 relieve the Contractor or the Contractor's Surety of any of their responsibilities under the
 Contract.
 (f) Failure to Comply - Failure to comply with 00180.21 will be cause for the Engineer to take
 action reasonably necessary to obtain compliance. This action may include, but is not limited to:
 
 • Suspension of the Work;
 • Withholding of Contract payments as necessary to protect the Agency; and
 • Termination of the Contract.
 (g) Mentor-Protégé Agreement - If the Contractor enters into a subcontract with an Emerging
 Small Business (ESB) Subcontractor, the Agency may offer the Contractor and its ESB
 Subcontractor an opportunity to enter into a Project specific Mentor-Protégé Agreement.
 
 The Project specific Mentor-Protégé Agreement will be paid for and specified by Change Order.
 93
 
 00180.22
 00180.22 Payments to Subcontractors and Agents of the Contractor - To the extent
 practicable, the Contractor shall pay in the same units and on the same basis of measurement as
 listed in the Schedule of Items for subcontracted Work or other Work not done by the Contractor's
 own organization. The Agency will not be responsible for any overpayment or losses resulting from
 overpayment by the Contractor to Subcontractors and to its other agents, work providers, service
 providers, and trucking services providers.
 
 If requested, the Engineer will make estimates of the Work quantities performed by Subcontractors
 or by others on the Project, and of Materials eligible for advances on Materials in the progress
 payments. These estimates are approximate only, and will be made in units of measure as listed in
 the Schedule of Items. The Agency does not guarantee the accuracy of these estimates, and an
 incorrect estimate will not bind the Agency in final settlement.
 If requested in writing by a first-tier Subcontractor, the Contractor shall send to the Subcontractor,
 within 10 Calendar Days of receiving the request, a copy of that portion of any invoice or request for
 payment submitted to the Agency, or pay document provided by the Agency to the Contractor,
 specifically related to any labor, Equipment, or Materials supplied by the first-tier Subcontractor.
 00180.30 Materials, Equipment, and Work Force - The Contractor shall furnish suitable and
 sufficient Materials, Equipment, and personnel to properly prosecute and complete the Work. The
 Contractor shall use only Equipment of adequate size and condition to meet the requirements of the
 Work and Specifications, and to produce a satisfactory quality of Work. Upon receipt of the
 Engineer's written order, the Contractor shall immediately remove, and not use again on the Project
 without the Engineer's prior written approval, Equipment that, in the Engineer's opinion, fails to meet
 Specifications or produce a satisfactory product or result.
 
 The work force shall be trained and experienced for the Work to be performed. Upon receipt of the
 Engineer's written order, the Contractor shall immediately remove from the Project Site, and shall
 not employ again on the Project without the Engineer's prior written approval, any supervisor or
 employee of the Contractor or any Subcontractor who, in the Engineer's opinion, does not perform
 satisfactory Work or whose conduct interferes with the progress of the Work.
 If the Contractor fails to remove Equipment or persons as ordered, or fails to furnish suitable and
 sufficient Materials, Equipment and personnel for the proper prosecution of the Work, the Engineer
 may suspend the Work by written notice until such orders are complied with and such deficiencies
 are corrected, or the Engineer may terminate the Contract under the provisions of 00180.90(a).
 00180.31 Required Materials, Equipment, Products, and Methods - The Engineer's decisions
 under this Section are final. Substitutions after Award will be considered as provided below unless
 specified as the subject of an exemption per ORS 279C.345. See 00120.16 for possible
 substitutions before Bid Opening.
 (a) General - When the Equipment and methods to be used are not specified in the Contract,
 any Equipment or methods that accomplish the Work as required by the Contract will be
 permitted.
 
 When the Contract specifies certain Equipment or methods, the Contractor shall use the
 Equipment or methods specified unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer in writing.
 (b) Substitution of Materials, Products, and Equipment to be Incorporated into the Work After execution of the Contract, the Engineer may approve substitution of Materials, products,
 and Equipment to be incorporated into the Work as follows:
 
 94
 
 00180.32
 (1) Reasons for Substitution - The Engineer will consider substitution only if:
 
 • The proposed Materials, products, or Equipment are equal to or superior to the specified
 items in construction, efficiency and utility; or
 • Due to reasons beyond the control of the Contractor, the specified Materials, products, or
 Equipment cannot be delivered to the Project in sufficient time to complete the Work in
 proper sequence.
 (2) Submittal of Request - The Contractor shall submit requests for substitution to the
 Engineer, including manufacturers' brochures and other information needed to verify equality
 of the proposed item(s).
 (c) Substitution of Equipment Specified to Perform Work - The Agency encourages
 development of new or improved Equipment and innovative use of Equipment. When the
 Specifications require Equipment of a particular size or type to be used to perform certain
 portions of the Work, the Contractor may submit a request to the Engineer to use Equipment of a
 different size or type. The request will not be considered as a cost reduction proposal
 under 00140.70. The request shall:
 
 • Be in writing and include a full description of the Equipment proposed and its intended use;
 • Include the reasons for requesting the substitution; and
 • Include evidence, obtained at the Contractor's expense and satisfactory to the Engineer,
 that the proposed Equipment is capable of functioning as well as or better than the specified
 Equipment.
 The Engineer will consider the Contractor's request and will provide a written response to the
 Contractor, either permitting or denying use of the proposed Equipment.
 Permission may be granted on a trial basis to test the quality of Work actually produced, subject
 to the following:
 • There will be no cost to the Agency, either in Contract Amount or in Contract Time;
 • The permission may be withdrawn by the Engineer at any time if, in the Engineer's opinion,
 the Equipment is not performing in all respects equivalent to the Equipment specified in the
 Contract;
 • If permission is withdrawn, the Contractor shall perform the remaining Work with the
 originally-specified Equipment; and
 • The Contractor shall remove and replace non-specification work resulting from the use of
 the Contractor's proposed Equipment, or otherwise correct it as the Engineer directs, at no
 additional compensation.
 (d) Substitution of Methods - The Agency encourages development of new, improved, and
 innovative construction methods. When the Plans or Specifications require a certain construction
 method for a portion of the Work, the Contractor may submit a request for a change by following
 the provisions of 00140.70, "Cost Reduction Proposals".
 00180.32 Alternative Materials, Equipment, and Methods - Whenever the Contract authorizes
 certain alternative Materials, Equipment, or methods of construction for the Contractor's use to
 perform portions of the Work, and leaves the selection to the Contractor, the Agency does not
 guarantee that all listed alternative Materials, Equipment, or methods of construction can be used
 successfully throughout all or any part of the Work.
 
 95
 
 00180.40
 The Contractor shall employ only those alternatives that can be used to satisfactorily perform the
 Work. No additional compensation will be paid for corrective work necessitated by the Contractor's
 use of an inappropriate alternative.
 00180.40 Limitation of Operations:
 (a) In General - The Contractor shall comply with all Contract provisions and shall:
 
 • Conduct the Work at all times so as to cause the least interference with traffic, and
 • Not begin Work that may allow damage to Work already started.
 (b) On-Site Work - The Contractor shall not begin On-Site Work until the Contractor has:
 
 • Received Notice to Proceed;
 • Filed with the Construction Contractors Board the public works bond as required
 in 00170.20;
 • An approved Project Work schedule;

 • An approved Pollution Control Plan;
 • An approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan;
 • Met with the Engineer at the required preconstruction conference; and
 • Assembled all Materials, Equipment, and labor on the Project Site, or has reasonably
 assured that they will arrive on the Project Site, so the Work can proceed according to the
 Project Work schedule.
 00180.41 Project Work Schedules - The Contractor shall submit a Project Work schedule meeting
 the requirements of this Subsection to the Engineer. The Project Work schedule is intended to
 identify the sequencing of activities and time required for prosecution of the Work. The schedule is
 used to plan, coordinate, and control the progress of construction. Therefore, the Project Work
 schedule shall provide for orderly, timely, and efficient prosecution of the Work, and shall contain
 sufficient detail to enable both the Contractor and the Engineer to plan, coordinate, analyze,
 document, and control their respective Contract responsibilities. Sufficient detail shall also include
 all required double shifts, overtime work, or combination of both necessary to complete Contract
 Work within the Contract Time.
 
 Contractor's activity related to developing, furnishing, monitoring, and updating these required
 schedules is Incidental.
 The Contractor shall submit a supplemental "look ahead" Project Work schedule each week to the
 Engineer. The "look ahead" Project Work schedule is supplemental to the Type A, B, or C schedule
 specified below. The supplemental "look ahead" Project Work schedule shall:
 • Identify the sequencing of activities and time required for prosecution of the Work.
 • Provide for orderly, timely, and efficient prosecution of the Work.
 • Contain sufficient detail to enable both the Contractor and the Engineer to plan, coordinate,
 analyze, document, and control their respective Contract responsibilities.
 The supplemental "look ahead" Project Work schedule shall be written in common terminology and
 show the planned Work activities broken down into logical, separate activities by area, stage, and
 size and include the following information:
 
 96
 
 00180.41
 • The resources the Contractor, Subcontractors, or services will use.
 • The locations of each activity that will be done including the limits of the Work by mile posts,
 stations, or other indicators.
 • The time frames of each activity by Calendar Days, shifts, and hours.
 • All anticipated Shoulder, lane, and road closures.
 At a minimum, the Contractor shall prepare a bar chart that:
 • Shows at least 3 weeks of activity including the week the bar chart is issued.
 • Uses a largest time scale unit of 1 Calendar Day. Smaller time scale units may be used if
 needed.
 • Is appropriate to the activities.
 • Identifies each Calendar Day by month and day.
 Include the Contract name, Contract number, Contractor's name, and date of issue on each page of
 the bar chart.
 The Contractor shall submit the supplemental "look ahead" Project Work schedule starting at First
 Notification and continuing each week until Second Notification has been issued and all punch list
 items and final trimming and clean-up has been completed. The Contractor shall meet with the
 Engineer each week to review the supplemental "look ahead" Project Work schedule. If the
 Engineer or the Contractor determines that the current supplemental "look ahead" Project Work
 schedule requires changes or additions, either notations can be made on the current schedule or
 the Engineer may require the submittal of a revised supplemental "look ahead" Project Work
 schedule. Review of the current and subsequent supplemental "look ahead" Project Work
 schedules does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for timely and efficient execution of the
 Contract.
 One of the following Type "A", "B", or "C" schedules will be required under the Contract. The type of
 schedule will be identified in the Special Provisions.
 (a) Type "A" Schedule - When a Type "A" schedule is required, the Contractor shall do the

 • Specified cure times for all concrete elements.
 101
 
 00180.41
 The activities shall be separately identifiable by coding or use of sub-networks or both. The
 duration of each activity shall be verifiable and consistent with the description in the Project
 narrative required in (3) below.
 Detailed sub-networks shall include all necessary activities and logic connectors to describe
 the Work and all restrictions on it. In the restraints, include those activities from any Project
 Work schedule that initiated the sub-network as well as those restrained by it.
 The time scale used on the Contractor's detailed time-scaled critical path method (CPM)
 network Project Work schedule shall be appropriate for the duration of the activities and the
 Project duration. The time scale shall be in normal workdays, defined as every day except
 Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays, with calendar dates identified no less than the first and
 midpoint of each calendar month. The smallest unit shown shall be 1 Day. The network shall
 show the length of the activity or part scaled to accurately represent the number of normal
 workdays scheduled. Distinct symbols or graphics shall be used to show multiple shift,
 holiday, or weekend work.
 The schedule network drawing(s) shall include a title block showing the Contract name and
 number, Contractor's name, date of original schedule, and all update dates; and a legend
 containing the symbols used, their definitions, and the time scale, shown graphically. To
 ensure readability the drawings shall be on a reasonable size of paper up to a maximum of
 36 inch x 36 inch, using multiple sheets when needed.
 The Contractor shall include a tabulation of each activity in the computer mathematical
 analysis of the network diagram. The following information represents the minimum required
 for each activity:
 • Event (node) number(s) for each activity;
 • Maintain event (node) numbers throughout the Project;
 • Activity description;

 • Latest start date (by calendar date);
 • Latest finish date (by calendar date); and
 • Slack or float time (in workdays).
 Computer print-outs shall consist of at least a node sort and an "early start/total-float" sort.
 Within 14 Calendar Days after submission of the detailed time-scaled critical path method
 (CPM) network Project Work schedule, the Engineer and the Contractor shall meet to review
 the detailed time-scaled critical path method (CPM) network Project Work schedule as
 submitted. Within 7 Calendar Days of the meeting, the Contractor shall resubmit to the
 Engineer one digital and four paper copies of the detailed time-scaled critical path method
 (CPM) network Project Work schedule, including required revisions.
 This first accepted detailed time-scaled critical path method (CPM) network Project Work
 schedule, also called the accepted Project Work schedule, shall represent all Work, as well as
 the planned sequence and time for the Work. Review and acceptance of any Project Work
 102
 
 00180.41
 schedules and Project narratives by the Engineer shall not relieve the Contractor of
 responsibility for timely and efficient execution of the Contract.
 (3) Project Narrative - In addition to the above requirements, and within 30 Calendar Days
 after First Notification, the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer a final written Project
 narrative that discusses the planning, coordinating, scheduling and resourcing of the Work.
 The Project narrative shall include the following written description:
 
 • Plans for staging the Project.
 • All critical activities.
 • All near critical activities defined as those with less than 30 Days of float.
 • All Subcontractor activities that are critical, near critical, and those that are greater than
 two weeks in duration.
 • Labor resourcing, by stage and phase, to include the number of crews, average crew size
 and planned night/weekend shifts including that of Subcontractors.
 • Equipment allocation, by stage and phase to include mobilization, demobilization and
 planned activities including that of Subcontractors.
 • Notifications required under the Contract during each stage and phase which may include
 but is not limited to road closures, lanes closures, night work, cold plane Pavement
 removal, and pile driving.
 • Provide discussion on addressing reasonably predictable weather conditions and their
 impact on all weather sensitive activities. Also, provide discussion on other weather
 limitations that may affect the Project schedule.
 • Submittal and approval of material samples, mix designs, and shop drawings.
 • Procurement of critical materials.
 • Plans for dealing with "unique" construction items.
 • Coordination of utilities and any immediate concerns for impacts/delays.
 • Constructability issues.
 • Cost Reduction Proposals and/or immediate requests for changes to the Specifications.
 • Concerns/issues that need to be addressed within the first 90 Days following First
 Notification.
 The accepted Project narrative shall represent all critical and near critical Work, as well as the
 planned sequence and time for the Work.
 (4) Review and Reporting - The Project Work schedule may require revision as the Work
 progresses. Therefore, the Contractor shall monitor and when necessary revise the Project
 Work schedule as follows:
 a. Review with the Engineer - The Contractor shall perform ongoing review of the
 accepted Project Work schedule and progress of the Work with the Engineer. If the
 Engineer or the Contractor determines that the accepted Project Work schedule no longer
 represents the Contractor's own plans or expected time for the Work, a meeting shall be
 held between the Engineer and the Contractor. At this meeting, the Contractor and the
 Engineer shall review Project events and any changes for their effect on the accepted
 Project Work schedule. After any necessary action has been agreed upon, the Contractor
 shall make required changes to the accepted Project Work schedule and associated Project
 narrative. Upon acceptance by the Engineer, this will become the new accepted Project
 Work schedule and associated Project narrative.
 
 103
 
 00180.41
 The Contractor shall collect information on all activities worked on or scheduled to be
 worked on during the previous report period, including shop drawings, Material
 procurement, and Contract Change Orders that have been issued. Information shall include
 actual start and completion dates on activities started or completed, or if still in progress, the
 remaining time duration.
 The Contractor shall develop detailed sub-networks to incorporate changes, Additional
 Work, and Extra Work into the Project Work schedule. Detailed sub-networks shall include
 all necessary activities and logic connectors to describe the Work and all restrictions on it.
 The restraints shall include those activities from the Project Work schedule that initiated the
 sub-network as well as those restrained by it. The procedure for acceptance of the revised
 or updated Project Work schedule as the new accepted Project Work schedule will be as
 provided above.
 The Contractor shall evaluate this information each month and compare it with the accepted
 Project Work schedule. The Contractor shall make an updated bar chart schedule to
 incorporate the effect changes may have on the Project completion time(s). For any activity
 that has started, the Contractor shall add a symbol to show the actual date the activity
 started and the number of normal workdays remaining until completion. For activities that
 are finished, a symbol shall be added to show the actual date. The Contractor shall submit ,
 digitally and in paper, copies of the updated bar chart to the Engineer within 7 Days after the
 progress meeting, along with a progress report as required by "b." below.
 b. Progress Report - Each month the Contractor shall submit a progress report and an
 update of the Project Work schedule to the Engineer. The report and updated schedule
 shall be submitted both digitally and in paper copy and shall include the following:
 
 • A sufficient description, in narrative form, to describe the past progress, anticipated
 activities, and stage Work;
 • A description of any current and expected changes or delaying factors and their effect
 on the construction schedule;
 • Proposed corrective actions;
 • Proposals to keep the Project on schedule in the event of a delay; and
 • Any changes to the logic as compared to the accepted Project Work schedule.
 (d) Substitution of Schedules - When a Type "A" schedule is required, a Type "B" or Type "C"
 schedule may be substituted for the Type "A" schedule.
 
 When a Type "B" schedule is required, a Type "C" schedule may be substituted for the Type "B"
 schedule.
 (e) Specified Contract Time Not Superseded by Schedule Revisions - The completion dates
 in any Project Work schedule and any revised or updated Project Work schedules shall be within
 the Contract Time(s) specified for the Project, or within adjusted Contract Times approved
 according to 00180.80(c). Acceptance of any Project Work schedule or any revised or updated
 Project Work schedules shall not constitute approval of any completion dates that exceed such
 Contract Time(s). If the Contractor believes that additional Contract Time is due, the Contractor
 shall submit, with a revised Project Work schedule, a request for adjustment of Contract Time
 according to 00180.80(c). A request for an adjustment of Contract Time will be evaluated using
 the most recently accepted Project Work schedule.
 (f) Float Time - Float time shown on the Project Work schedule, including any time between a
 Contractor's scheduled completion date and the specified Contract Time(s), does not exist for the
 exclusive use of either party to the Contract and belongs to the Project.
 
 104
 
 00180.50
 (g) Schedules Do Not Constitute Notice - Submittal of a Project Work schedule, with
 supporting Project narrative, does not constitute or substitute for any notice the Contractor is
 required under the terms of the Contract to give the Agency.
 (h) Failure to Provide Schedule - The Project Work schedule is essential to the Agency. The
 Contractor's failure to provide the schedule, schedule information, progress reports, Project
 narratives, or schedule updates when required will be cause to suspend the Work, or to withhold
 Contract payments as necessary to protect the Agency, until the Contractor provides the required
 information to the Engineer.
 00180.42 Preconstruction Conference - Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer,
 before any Work is performed and within 30 Calendar Days of the Notice to Proceed, the Contractor
 shall meet with the Engineer for a preconstruction conference at a time mutually agreed upon.
 00180.43 Commencement and Performance of Work - From the time of commencement of the
 Work to the time of Final Acceptance the Contractor shall:
 
 • Provide adequate Materials, Equipment, labor, and supervision to perform and complete the
 Work;
 • Perform the Work as vigorously and as continuously as conditions permit, and according to a
 Project Work schedule that ensures completion within the Contract Time or the adjusted
 Contract Time;
 • Not voluntarily suspend or slow down operations without prior written approval from the
 Engineer; and
 • Not resume suspended Work without the Engineer's written authorization.
 00180.50 Contract Time to Complete Work:
 (a) General - The time allowed to complete the Work or Pay Item is stipulated in the Solicitation
 Documents, and will be known as the "Contract Time". (See 00110.20.)
 (b) Kinds of Contract Time - The Contract Time will be expressed in one or more of the
 following ways:
 (1) Fixed Date Calculation - The calendar date on which the Work or Pay Item shall be
 completed; or
 (2) Calendar Day Calculation - The number of Calendar Days from a specified beginning
 point in which the Work or Pay Item shall be completed.
 (c) Beginning of Contract Time - When the Contract Time is stated in Calendar Days, counting
 of Contract Calendar Days will begin with the fifteenth Calendar Day following the date of the
 Notice to Proceed.
 (d) Recording Contract Time - All Contract Time will be recorded and charged to the nearest
 one-half Day.
 
 On Contracts with Calendar Day counts, the Engineer will furnish the Contractor a weekly
 statement of Contract Time charges. The statement will show the number of Calendar Days
 counted for the preceding week and the number of Calendar Days remaining prior to the
 established completion date for that Pay Item.
 
 105
 
 00180.60
 For Contracts with fixed completion dates for Pay Items, the Engineer will furnish the Contractor a
 weekly statement of Contract Time charges only after expiration of the Contract Time. The
 statement will show the number of Calendar Days of liquidated damages that have been
 assessed, if any.
 These statements will include any exclusions from, or adjustments to, Contract Time.
 (e) Exclusions from Contract Time - Regardless of the way Contract Time is expressed in the
 Contract, certain Calendar Days will not be charged against Contract Time. These exclusions will
 be allowed when the Contractor is prevented from performing Work due to one of the following
 reasons, resulting in delay:
 
 • Acts of God or Nature;
 • Court orders enjoining prosecution of the Work;
 • Strikes, labor disputes or freight embargoes that, despite the Contractor's reasonable efforts
 to avoid them, cause a shutdown of the entire Project or one or more major operations.
 "Strike" and "labor dispute" may include union action against the Contractor, a
 Subcontractor, a materials Supplier, or the Agency; or
 • Suspension of the Work by written order of the Engineer for reasons other than the
 Contractor's failure or neglect.
 (f) Time Calculation Protest - In the event the Contractor disputes the accuracy of the
 statement of Contract Time charges, it shall immediately contact the Engineer and attempt to
 resolve the dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved informally, the Contractor shall submit a
 formal written protest to the Engineer within 7 Calendar Days of the date the Engineer mailed or
 delivered the statement. Failure to submit a formal written protest within the 7 Calendar Day
 period constitutes the Contractor's approval of the time charges, or adjusted time charges,
 itemized in the statement.
 (g) End of Contract Time - When the Engineer determines that the On-Site Work has been
 completed, except for the items listed below, the Engineer will issue a Second Notification.
 
 The Second Notification will list:
 • The date the time charges stopped;
 • Final trimming and cleanup tasks (see 00140.90);
 • Equipment to be removed from the Project Site;
 • Minor corrective work not involving additional payment to be completed; and
 • Submittals, including, without limitation, all required certifications, bills, forms, warranties,
 certificate of insurance coverage (00170.70(b)), and other documents, required to be
 provided to the Engineer before Third Notification will issue.
 The Contractor shall complete all tasks listed in the Second Notification in an expeditious manner
 within the time frame proposed by the Contractor and accepted by the Engineer. Unless
 otherwise agreed by the Agency, failure of the Contractor to complete all tasks listed in the
 Second Notification within the time frame accepted, will result in the Agency rescinding the
 Second Notification. Counting of time charges will resume upon expiration of the accepted time
 frame.
 00180.60 Notice of Delay - The Contractor shall notify the Engineer of any delay that will likely
 prevent completion of the Work or a Pay Item by the date specified in the Project Work schedule.
 The notice shall be in writing and shall be submitted within 7 Calendar Days of when the Contractor
 
 106
 
 00180.70
 knew or should have known of the delay. The notice shall include, to the extent available, the
 following:
 • The reasons or causes for the delay;
 • The estimated duration of the delay and the estimated resulting cumulative delay in Contract
 completion;
 • Except for 00180.50(e) and 00180.65 delays, whether or not the Contractor expects to request
 an adjustment of Contract Time due to the delay;
 • Whether or not the Contractor expects to accelerate due to the delay; and
 • Whether or not the Contractor expects to request additional compensation due to the delay.
 Except for 00180.50(e) and 00180.65 delays, failure to include this information will constitute
 waiver of the Contractor's right to later make such a request.
 00180.65 Right-of-Way and Access Delays - Right-of-Way and access delays will be taken into
 consideration in adjusting Contract Time, and in approving additional compensation if the
 performance of the Work is delayed because of the Agency's failure to make available to the
 Contractor:
 
 • Necessary Rights-of-Way;
 • Agency-owned or Agency-controlled Materials sources that are offered in the Contract for the
 Contractor's use; or
 • Access to, or rights of occupancy of, buildings and other properties the Contractor is required
 to enter or to disturb according to Contract requirements.
 If the ending date of an anticipated delay is stated in the Special Provisions, only the delay occurring
 after that date will be considered for adjusting Contract Time or providing additional compensation.
 00180.70 Suspension of Work:
 (a) General - The Engineer has authority to suspend the Work, or part of the Work, for any of the
 following causes:
 
 • Failure of the Contractor to correct unsafe conditions;
 • Failure of the Contractor to carry out any provision of the Contract;
 • Failure of the Contractor to carry out orders issued by the Engineer, the Agency, or any
 regulatory authority;
 • Existence of conditions unsuitable to proper or safe performance of the Work; or
 • Any reason considered by the Agency to be in the public interest.
 When Work has been suspended for any reason, the Contractor shall not resume Work without
 the Engineer's written authorization.
 (b) Contractor's Responsibilities during and after Suspension - During periods of
 suspension of the Work, the Contractor shall continue to be responsible for protecting and
 repairing the Work according to 00170.80, and for ensuring that a single designated
 representative responsible for the Project remains available according to 00150.40(b).
 
 When Work is resumed after suspension, unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the
 Contractor shall perform the following at no additional compensation:
 
 107
 
 00180.80
 • Replace or repair any Work, Materials, and Equipment to be incorporated into the Work that
 was lost or damaged because of the temporary use of the Project Site by the public; and
 • Remove Materials, Equipment, and temporary construction necessitated by temporary
 maintenance during the suspension, as directed by the Engineer.
 (c) Compensation and Allowances for Suspension - Compensation and allowance of
 additional Contract Time due to suspension of any portion of the Work will be authorized only for
 Agency-initiated suspensions for reasons other than the Contractor's failure or neglect.
 (See 00180.50(e), 00180.65, and 00195.40.)
 00180.80 Adjustment of Contract Time:
 (a) General - Contract Time established for the Work will be subject to adjustment, either by
 increase or decrease, for causes beyond the control of the Contractor, according to the terms of
 this Subsection. After adjustment, the Contract Time will become, and be designated as, the
 "Adjusted Contract Time". Except as provided in 00180.65 and 00195.40, an adjustment of
 Contract Time shall be the Contractor's only remedy for any delay arising from causes beyond
 the control of the Contractor.
 (b) Contractor's Request Not Required - The Engineer may increase or decrease the Contract
 Time or the Adjusted Contract Time if Change Orders or Extra Work orders issued actually
 increase or decrease the amount of time required to perform the Work. The Engineer may also
 increase Contract Time in the event of Right-of-Way and Access delays (see 00180.65), and
 those delays due to causes beyond the Contractor's control specified in 00180.50(e). The
 Engineer will promptly inform the Contractor of adjustments made to Contract Time according to
 this Subsection, and will include the reasons for adjustment.
 
 If the Agency anticipates delay during performance of the Contract, and specifies its expected
 duration in the Special Provisions, the Engineer will only consider additional delay beyond the
 stipulated duration in determining whether to adjust Contract Time.
 (c) Contractor's Request Required - In the event the Contractor believes that additional
 Contract Time is due, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a timely request for adjustment
 of Contract Time. The Engineer will not consider untimely requests. The Agency regards as
 timely only those requests for adjustment of Contract Time that:
 
 • Accompany a proposed revised Project Work schedule submitted according to 00180.41, for
 comparison with the last revision of the Project Work schedule; or
 • Are not otherwise deemed waived and are submitted within 15 Days after the date of
 Second Notification, if Second Notification has been issued.
 The Engineer will not grant an adjustment of Contract Time for events that occurred prior to the
 date of the last revision of the Project Work schedule. The Engineer will not authorize, nor the
 Agency pay, acceleration costs incurred by the Contractor prior to its submittal of a request for
 adjustment of Contract Time to which the acceleration costs relate.
 The Contractor's request for adjustment of Contract Time shall be submitted to the Engineer on a
 form provided by, or in a format acceptable to, the Engineer, and shall include a copy of the
 written notice required under 00180.60. The request shall include without limitation:
 • Consent of the Contractor's Surety if the request totals more than 30 Calendar Days of
 additional Contract Time;
 • Sufficient detail for the Engineer to evaluate the asserted justification for the amount of
 additional Contract Time requested;
 108
 
 00180.80
 • The cause of each delay for which additional Contract Time is requested, together with
 supporting analysis and data;
 • Reference to the Contract provision allowing Contract Time adjustment for each cause of
 delay;
 • The actual or expected duration of delay resulting from each cause of delay, expressed in
 Calendar Days; and
 • A schedule analysis based on the current approved Project Work schedule for each cause
 of delay, indicating which activities are involved and their impact on Contract completion.
 (d) Basis for Adjustment of Contract Time - In the adjustment of Contract Time, the Engineer
 will consider causes that include, but are not limited to:
 
 • Failure of the Agency to submit the Contract and bond forms to the Contractor for execution
 within the time stated in 00130.50, or to submit the Notice to Proceed within the time stated
 in 00130.90;
 • Errors, changes, or omissions in the Supplemental Drawings, quantities, or Specifications;
 • Performance of Extra Work;
 • Failure of the Agency or Entities acting for the Agency to act promptly in carrying out
 Contract duties and obligations;
 • Acts or omissions of the Agency or Entities acting for the Agency that result in unreasonable
 delay referenced in 00195.40;
 • Causes cited in 00180.50(e); and
 • Right-of-way and access delays referenced in 00180.65.
 The Engineer will not consider requests for adjustment of Contract Time based on any of the
 following:
 • Contentions that insufficient Contract Time was originally specified in the Contract;
 • Delays that do not affect the specified or Adjusted Contract Time;
 • Delays that affect the Contractor's planned early completion, but that do not affect the
 specified or adjusted Contract Time;
 • Shortage or inadequacy of Materials, Equipment or labor;
 • Late delivery of Materials and Equipment to be incorporated into the Work, except under
 those conditions referenced in 00180.50(e);
 • Different area of Material source in 00160.40(a);
 • Substitution of Equipment in 00180.31(c);
 • Reasonably predictable weather conditions; or
 • Other matters within the Contractor's control or Contract responsibility.
 (e) Consideration and Response by Agency - The Engineer will only consider a Contractor's
 request for Contract Time adjustment submitted according to the requirements of 00180.80(c).
 The Engineer may elect not to consider claimed delays that do not affect the specified or adjusted
 Contract Time required to complete the Work.
 
 The Engineer may adjust Contract Time for causes not specifically identified by the Contractor in
 its request.
 The Engineer will review a properly submitted request for Contract Time adjustment, and within a
 reasonable time will advise the Contractor of the Engineer's findings. If the Contractor disagrees
 109
 
 00180.85
 with the Engineer's findings, the Contractor may request review according to the procedure
 specified in 00199.40.
 00180.85 Failure to Complete on Time; Liquidated Damages:
 (a) Time is of the Essence - Time is of the essence in the Contractor's performance of the
 Contract. It is essential and in the public interest that the Contractor prosecute the Work
 vigorously to Contract completion and within Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time.
 
 The Agency does not waive any rights under the Contract by permitting the Contractor to
 continue to perform the Contract, or any part of it, after the Contract Time or adjusted Contract
 Time has expired.
 (b) Liquidated Damages - Delays in the Contractor's performance of the Work will cause the
 Agency to sustain damages; increase risk to, inconvenience, and interfere with the traveling
 public and commerce; and increase costs to taxpayers. Because the Agency finds it is unduly
 burdensome and difficult to demonstrate the exact dollar value of such damages, the Contractor
 agrees to pay to the Agency, not as a penalty but as liquidated damages, the amount(s)
 determined as specified below for each Calendar Day the Work remains incomplete after the
 expiration of the Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time applicable to that Work. The liquidated
 damages shall constitute payment in full only of damages incurred by the Agency due to the
 Contractor's failure to complete the Work on time.
 
 Payment by the Contractor of liquidated damages does not release the Contractor from its
 obligation to fully and timely perform the Contract according to its terms. Nor does acceptance of
 liquidated damages by the Agency constitute a waiver of the Agency's right to collect any
 additional damages it may sustain by reason of the Contractor's failure to fully perform the
 Contract according to its terms.
 If the Contract is terminated according to 00180.90(a), and if the Work has not been completed
 by other means on or before the expiration of Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time, liquidated
 damages will be assessed against the Contractor for the duration of time reasonably required to
 complete the Work.
 (1) Single Contract Time - The liquidated damages per Calendar Day* for failure to complete
 the Work on time as required by 00180.50(h) when a single Contract Time is listed
 under 00180.50(h) will be established using the following formula:
 
 The Liquidated Damages per Calendar Day* are 21.2 percent of C divided by T as defined in
 this Section.
 C = The Contractor’s Bid amount for the Contract.
 T = The total Calendar Days between the latest completion date or time listed
 under 00180.50(h) in the Solicitation Documents and the Bid Opening that will result in the
 greatest value for T.
 * Calendar Day amounts are applicable when the Contract Time is expressed on the Calendar
 Day or fixed date basis.
 (2) Multiple Contract Times - The liquidated damages per Calendar Day* for failure to
 complete the Work on time as required by 00180.50(h) when multiple Contract Times are listed
 under 00180.50(h) will be established for each individual Contract Time as follows:
 
 110
 
 00180.90
 The Agency-determined percentage of the value of all Work required to be complete by a
 given Contract Time multiplied by the rate determined using the formula specified in
 00180.85(b)(1).
 When multiple Contract Times are listed under 00180.50(h), the Agency-determined
 percentages of the value of Work required to be complete by the Contract Times listed under
 00180.50(h) will be listed in the Special Provisions.
 If liquidated damages should become payable concurrently under any combination of
 liquidated damage rates, the rate that will be assessed will be the highest applicable rate.
 * Calendar Day amounts are applicable when the Contract Time is expressed on the Calendar
 Day or fixed date basis.
 00180.90 Termination of Contract and Substituted Performance:
 (a) Termination for Default - Termination of the Contract for default may result if the Contractor:
 
 • Fails to comply with the requirements for records;
 • Violates any material provision of the Contract;
 • Disregards applicable laws and regulations or the Engineer's instructions;
 • Refuses or fails to supply enough Materials, Equipment or skilled workers for prosecution of
 the Work in compliance with the Contract;
 • Fails to make prompt payment to Subcontractors;
 • Makes an unauthorized general assignment for the benefit of the Contractor's creditors;
 • Has a receiver appointed because of the Contractor's insolvency;
 • Is adjudged bankrupt and the court consents to the Contract termination; or
 • Otherwise fails or refuses to faithfully perform the Contract according to its terms and
 conditions.
 If the Contract is terminated by the Agency, upon demand the Contractor and the Contractor's
 Surety shall provide the Engineer with immediate and peaceful possession of the Project Site,
 and of all Materials and Equipment to be incorporated into the Work, whether located on and off
 the Project Site, for which the Contractor received progress payments under 00195.50.
 If the Contract is terminated for default, neither the Contractor nor its Surety shall be:
 • Relieved of liability for damages or losses suffered by the Agency because of the
 Contractor's breach of Contract; or
 • Entitled to receive any further progress payments until the Work is completed. However,
 progress payments for completed Work that remain due and owing at the time of Contract
 termination may be made according to the terms of 00195.50, except that the Engineer will
 be entitled to withhold sufficient funds to cover costs incurred by the Agency as a result of
 the termination. Final payment to the Contractor will be made according to the provisions of
 Section 00195.
 If a termination under this provision is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
 unjustified, the termination shall be deemed a termination for public convenience.
 (b) Substituted Performance - According to the Agency's procedures, and upon the Engineer's
 recommendation that sufficient cause exists, the Agency, without prejudice to any of its other
 
 111
 
 00180.90
 rights or remedies and after giving the Contractor and the Contractor's Surety 10 Calendar Days'
 written notice, may:
 • Terminate the Contract;
 • Substitute the Contractor with another Entity to complete the Contract;
 • Take possession of the Project Site;
 • Take possession of Materials on the Project Site;
 • Take possession of Materials not on the Project Site, for which the Contractor received
 progress payments under 00195.50;
 • Take possession of Equipment on the Project Site that is to be incorporated into the Work;
 • Take possession of Equipment not on the Project Site that is to be incorporated into the
 Work, and for which the Contractor received progress payments under 00195.50; and
 • Finish the Work by whatever method the Agency deems expedient.
 If, within the 10 Calendar Day notice period provided above, the Contractor and/or its Surety
 corrects the basis for declaration of default to the satisfaction of the Engineer, or if the
 Contractor's Surety submits a proposal for correction that is acceptable to the Engineer, the
 Contract will not be terminated.
 (c) Termination for Public Convenience - The Engineer may terminate the Contract for
 convenience in whole or in part whenever the Engineer determines that termination of the
 Contract is in the best interest of the public.
 
 The Engineer will provide the Contractor and the Contractor's Surety 7 Calendar Days' written
 notice of termination for public convenience. After such notice, the Contractor and the
 Contractor's Surety shall provide the Engineer with immediate and peaceful possession of the
 Project Site, and of Materials and Equipment to be incorporated into the Work, whether located
 on and off the Project Site, for which the Contractor received progress payments under 00195.50.
 Compensation for Work terminated by the Engineer under this provision will be determined
 according to the provisions of 00195.70(b).
 
 112
 
 00190.10
 Section 00190 - Measurement of Pay Quantities
 Description
 00190.00 Scope - The Engineer will measure pay quantities for accepted Work according to the
 United States standard measure unless otherwise provided in the Contract. Unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract, the Engineer will round off all quantity computations using the following
 convention:
 
 • The final significant digit will not be changed when the succeeding digit is less than 5.
 • The final significant digit will be increased by one when the succeeding digit is 5 or greater.
 The measurement provisions contained in the Specifications for each Pay Item will supplement or
 modify the above convention by:
 • Imposing measurement limitations
 • Describing measurement or computation procedures
 • Giving conversion factors or adjustment conditions
 • Providing for determination of reasonably accurate and representative Pay Item quantities
 Measurements required or allowed to be made by the Contractor will be subject to the Engineer's
 verification. The Engineer's decision about measurement is final.
 00190.10 Measurement Guidelines - Measurement of quantities will be made on the following
 bases, unless otherwise specified in the Contract:
 (a) Unit Basis - Unit will be each, unless otherwise specified in the Contract and will be
 determined by actual count of units in place.
 (b) Length Basis - Length will be feet or mile, unless otherwise specified in the Contract and will
 be determined by measuring the length at least to the nearest 0.1 foot or at least to the
 nearest 0.1 mile, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in the Contract. Measurements will be
 limited to the dimensions shown or specified, or as directed by the Engineer.
 (c) Area Basis - Area will be square foot, square yard, or acre, unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract and will be determined by measuring the width and the length (or height) at least to the
 nearest 0.1 foot and computed at least to the nearest 0.1 square foot, nearest 0.1 square yard, or
 nearest 0.1 acre, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 (d) Weight Basis - Weight will be pound or ton, unless otherwise specified in the Contract and
 will be determined as follows:
 (1) Pound - Pound weight will be determined by the net weight identified on the
 manufacturer's packaged labels, subject to periodic check weighing. Weight by pound will be
 measured at least to the nearest 1.0 pound unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 
 Provide a certificate with each shipment together with a certified copy of the weight of each
 delivery. If the check weight is less than the manufacturer weight by more than 0.4%, the
 discrepancy will be resolved by the Engineer.
 (2) Ton - Ton weight will be determined on Contractor-provided scales as required
 under 00190.20 unless otherwise allowed by the Specifications. Weight by ton will be
 measured at least to the nearest 0.01 ton unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 
 113
 
 00190.10
 If bituminous materials, portland cement, lime, and similar bulk Materials are shipped by truck
 or rail, the supplier's shipping invoice with net scale weights, or volumes converted to weights,
 may be used for Pay Item quantity determination in place of weights determined on the
 Contractor-provided vehicle scales.
 Shipping invoice weights of the supplier's truck or transport shall be subject to periodic check
 weighing on the Contractor's vehicle scales, or other scales designated, according
 to 00190.20. If the check weight is less than the supplier weight by more than 0.4%, the
 discrepancy will be resolved by the Engineer.
 No payment will be made:
 • For quantities in excess of the supplier weight
 • When Materials have been lost, wasted, or otherwise not incorporated into the Work
 • For additional hauling costs resulting from the check weighing
 (e) Volume Basis - Volume will be cubic yard truck measure or in-place measure, gallons, foot
 board measure (FBM), or thousand foot board measure (MFBM), unless otherwise specified in
 the Contract and will be measured at least to the nearest 0.1 cubic yard, nearest 1.0 gallon,
 nearest 0.1 FBM, or nearest 0.1 MFBM, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 
 Truck measure will be the measured and calculated maximum "water level" capacity of the
 vehicle. Quantities will be determined at the point of delivery, with no allowance for settlement of
 Material during transit. When required to facilitate measurement, the vehicle load shall be leveled
 at the point of delivery. Payment will not be made for Material in excess of the maximum "water
 level" capacity. Deductions will be made for loads below the maximum "water level" capacity.
 When bituminous materials are measured by volume, the volume will be measured at 60 F or will
 be corrected to the volume at 60 F using the correction factors found in the MFTP
 (ODOT TM 321).
 (f) Time Basis - Time will be hour, Day, or year, unless otherwise specified in the Contract, and
 will be measured to at least the nearest 0.5 hour, nearest 1.0 Day, or nearest 1.0 year, as
 applicable, unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 (g) Standard Manufactured Items - If standard manufactured items, such as fence, wire, plates,
 rolled shapes, pipe, conduit and other similar items are specified in the Contract by properties
 such as gauge, unit weight, or section dimensions, the manufacturing tolerances established by
 the industry involved will be accepted unless more stringent tolerances are cited in the Contract.
 (h) Lump Sum Basis - Lump sum, when used, means the Work described shall be completed
 and accepted without measurement unless changes are ordered in writing by the Engineer. If
 estimated quantities of the Work to be performed are listed in the Special Provisions, they provide
 only a basis for adjusting payment amounts. Estimated quantities are approximate only, and are
 made from a reasonable interpretation of the Contract Documents. Computations based on the
 details and dimensions shown on the Contract Documents are not guaranteed to equal estimated
 quantities.
 
 If the Agency issues no Change Order, the Agency will make no pay adjustment for quantities
 based on the Contractor's computations that overrun or underrun the estimated quantities.
 If the Agency issues Change Orders for changes in the Work, the Engineer will measure such
 changes according to the standards set by 00195.20 to determine adjustment of payment.

 00190.20
 00190.20 Contractor to Provide Vehicle Weigh Scales:
 (a) General - If the Specifications require measurement by weighing on vehicle weigh scales, the
 Contractor shall provide vehicle weigh scales and shall transport Materials to the scales. Subject
 to the Engineer's approval, weights may be determined by plant or hopper scales according
 to 00190.30.
 Contractor-provided scales shall be furnished, installed and maintained by the Contractor or its
 supplier, or, subject to the Engineer's approval, may be commercial scales located in the vicinity
 of the Project.
 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, Pay Items to be measured by weight shall include all
 Contractor costs for providing, maintaining, inspecting, and testing scales; for furnishing
 appropriate weigh tickets; for self-printing scales; and for transporting Materials to the scales or to
 check weighing.
 (b) Requirements - The scales shall conform to ORS 618, or the laws of the state in which they
 are located, and NIST Handbook 44, and shall be:
 • Licensed by the Oregon Department of Agriculture, or by the analogous regulatory body for
 scales located outside the State;
 • Technically suitable for weighing the Materials;
 • Properly installed and maintained; and
 • Accurate to the required tolerances.
 The weight of any Materials weighed by anyone other than the Engineer will be subject to check
 weighing as the Engineer directs.
 (c) Approaches - Vehicle scale approaches shall be:
 • At each end of the scale platform;
 • Straight and in line with the platform; and
 • Long enough to accommodate combination vehicles longer than the scale platform so that
 they are level and allow release of brakes before weighing.
 (d) Inspections - Contractor shall have all scales certified, that is inspected and their accuracy
 tested, by the Oregon Department of Agriculture, an analogous regulatory body for scales located
 outside the State, or a scale service company, as follows:
 • Before use if installed at a new site;
 • 60 Calendar Days after initial inspection;
 
 • As otherwise required by the Oregon Department of Agriculture, or an analogous regulatory
 body for scales located outside the State; and
 • When the Engineer directs additional inspections.
 No Materials weighed on scales without current certifications according to this Subsection will be
 accepted. The Contractor shall provide a copy of all required certifications to the Engineer.
 Testing by a scale service company within the State of Oregon shall comply with ORS 618.
 If additional inspections directed by the Engineer confirm that the scale accuracy is within the
 required tolerances, the Agency will pay the cost for inspecting and testing the scales. If the
 115
 
 00190.20
 scale accuracy is not within these tolerances, the Contractor shall pay the cost for inspecting and
 testing the scales.
 (e) Inspection Results - If an inspection indicates the scales have been under-weighing
 (indicating less than the true weight), the Agency will make no additional payment to the
 Contractor for Materials previously weighed.
 
 If an inspection indicates the scales have been over-weighing (indicating more than the true
 weight), the weights will be reduced for Materials received after the time the Engineer determines
 the overweighing began or, if that is not possible, after the last acceptable certification of the
 scales. The reduction will be the amount of error in excess of the 0.2% maintenance tolerance
 allowed in the Contract.
 (f) Contractor-Provided Weigh Technician - The Contractor shall provide a technician to
 operate Contractor-provided vehicle weigh scales. The Agency may observe procedures and
 require check weighing according to the following:
 (1) Scale with Automatic Printer - If the scales have an automatic weigh memo printer that
 does not require manual entry of gross weight information, the Agency may periodically have a
 representative at the scales to observe the weighing procedures. In addition, the Engineer
 may periodically check the weight for a load of Materials by directing the haul vehicle to
 reweigh on a different scale that has been inspected and certified according to 00190.20(b)
 and 00190.20(d).
 
 If a different scale is not available within a 30-mile round trip from the regular haul route, the
 Agency will allow check weighing on an approved alternate basis. Check weights within 0.4%
 of the Contractor-provided weight are acceptable.
 The Engineer will resolve discrepancies found by check weighing. Agency employee costs will
 be paid by the Agency. The Contractor shall pay all other costs resulting from the check
 weighings, including, without limitation, the use of other scales.
 If more than 50 tons per Day of all types of Materials are received from a scale, the Contractor
 shall make random check weighings at least every tenth Day on which more than 50 tons is
 received or at each interval that 10,000 tons has been weighed, whichever occurs first, or as
 directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall make at least one check weighing on projects
 where more than 2,000 tons of all types of Materials are received from a scale. The Contractor
 shall provide the Engineer with the results of the check weighing.
 (2) Scale Without Automatic Printer - If the scales require manual entry of gross weight
 information, the Agency may periodically have a representative weigh witness at the scales to
 observe the weighing procedures. The Contractor shall inform the Engineer of his intent to use
 a scale without an automatic printer at least 3 working days before weighing begins or before
 the Contractor changes to a scale that does not have an automatic printer. The Contractor
 shall pay costs for the weigh witness. The hourly cost of the weigh witness will be as stated in
 the Special Provisions. In addition, the Engineer may periodically check the weight for a load
 of Materials by directing the haul vehicle to reweigh on a different scale that has been
 inspected and certified according to 00190.20(b) and 00190.20(d).
 
 If a different scale is not available within a 30-mile round trip from the regular haul route, the
 Agency will allow check weighing on an approved alternate basis. Check weights within 0.4%
 of the Contractor-provided weight are acceptable.
 
 116
 
 00190.30
 The Engineer will resolve discrepancies found by check weighing. Agency employee costs for
 check weighings will be paid by the Agency. The Contractor shall pay all other costs resulting
 from the check weighings, including, without limitation, the use of other scales.
 If more than 50 tons per Day of all types of Materials are received from a scale, the Contractor
 shall make random check weighings at least every tenth day on which more than 50 tons is
 received or at each interval that 10,000 tons has been weighed, whichever occurs first, or as
 directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall make at least one check weighing on all
 projects where materials are received from a scale without an automatic printer. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with the results of the check weighing.
 (3) Duties of Weigh Technician - The Contractor's weigh technician shall:
 
 • Determine twice a Day, or as otherwise directed by the Engineer, the empty haul weights
 (tare weights) of hauling vehicles, unless vehicles are tared before each load;
 • Furnish daily a listing of the tare weights if 10 or more loads are hauled during that Day;
 • Furnish a note listing the net weight for each consecutive ten loads with the following
 load;
 • Furnish a daily listing of the net weights and total weight for each type of Material hauled
 during that Day; and
 • Furnish a legible, serially numbered weigh memo for each load of Materials to the
 Agency's Materials receiver at the point of delivery, or as directed by the Engineer. The
 memo shall identify the Project, the Materials, the date, net weight (gross and tare as
 appropriate), and identification of the vehicle and weigh technician.
 (g) Agency-Provided Weigh Technician - If the Contractor provides vehicle weigh scales
 without a weigh technician meeting the requirements of this Subsection, the Agency will provide a
 weigh technician at the Contractor's expense. The hourly cost for the weigh technician will be as
 stated in the Special Provisions. The Contractor shall provide a weighhouse for the weigh
 technician according to Section 00205. The Agency's weigh technician will:
 
 • Determine tare weights;
 • Prepare weigh memos for each load;
 • Compile the weigh records; and
 • Not participate in the production of Materials or the loading of haul vehicles.
 00190.30 Plant Scales - The Contractor, with the Engineer's written approval, may weigh
 plant-mixed Materials on scales that have either:
 
 • An automatic weight batching and mixing control printer system; or
 • A weigh hopper printer system.
 Any additional costs resulting from the use of these scales shall be borne by the Contractor. Check
 weighing will be done according to 00190.20(f).
 Except for 00190.20(c) regarding approaches, the Contractor's use of plant scales shall comply with
 all provisions of 00190.20.
 The Engineer's approval for the Contractor's use of plant scales to determine pay weights will be
 rescinded if check weighing or scale inspections indicate the scales do not consistently determine
 weights within the tolerances allowed by state law.

 00195.00
 Section 00195 - Payment
 Description
 00195.00 Scope and Limit:
 (a) General - The Agency will pay only for measured Pay Item quantities incorporated into the
 Work or performed according to the terms of the Contract. The Contractor understands and
 agrees that Pay Item quantities listed in the Schedule of Items do not govern payment.
 
 Payment constitutes full compensation to the Contractor for furnishing all Materials, Equipment,
 labor, and Incidentals necessary to complete the Work; and for risk, loss, damage, and expense
 arising from the nature or prosecution of the Work or from the action of the elements, subject to
 the provisions of 00170.80. The Contractor shall include the costs of bonds and insurance for the
 Project in the unit price for each Pay Item of Work to be performed.
 (b) Essential or Incidental Materials or Work - When the Specifications state that the unit price
 for a Pay Item is compensation for certain Materials or Work essential or Incidental to the Pay
 Item, the same Materials or Work will not be measured or paid under any other Pay Item.
 Provisions and Requirements
 00195.10 Payment For Changes in Materials Costs - On certain projects, as identified in the
 Special Provisions, an escalation/de-escalation clause with respect to certain materials will be in
 effect during the life of the Contract.
 00195.12 Steel Material Price Escalation/De-Escalation Clause - Subsections 00195.12,
 00195.12(a), 00195.12(b), 00195.12(c), and 00195.12(d) contain the price escalation/de-escalation
 clause relating to steel materials (as defined in 00195.12(d)) that is included in this Contract. This
 exclusive steel material price escalation/de-escalation clause, and the steel escalation/de-escalation
 program described in 00195.12 through 00195.12(d), are in effect for the life of this Contract
 regardless of the number of steel material Pay Items, if any, that are included, and whether or not
 the Contractor elects to participate in the steel escalation/de-escalation program according to
 00195.12(d).
 (a) Steel Material Price Escalation/De-Escalation Participation - The Contractor may select
 individual Pay Items to include in the steel escalation/de-escalation program from those Pay
 Items listed for this Project under 00195.12(d) by following the directions provided in 00195.12(d).
 The Contractor is not obligated to select any Pay Items. Before or within 5 business days after
 the date of the preconstruction conference, the Contractor shall submit in writing to the Project
 Manager the Pay Items selected by the Contractor to be included in the steel escalation/deescalation program, in the manner required under 00195.12(d). If the Contractor fails to inform
 the Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel escalation/de-escalation program in the
 manner and within the time limits stated in 00195.12(d) (or the Contractor otherwise elects not to
 participate in the program), the Contractor thereby elects not to participate in the program and
 forfeits all present and future rights to participate in the program for this Project.
 
 The Agency reserves all of its rights under the Contract, including, but not limited to, its rights for
 suspension of the Work under 00180.70 and its rights for termination of the Contract
 under 00180.90, and this steel material price escalation/de-escalation provision will not limit those
 rights. Adjustment for fluctuations in the cost of steel material will apply only to the Pay Items
 individually selected by the Contractor from the Pay Items listed under 00195.12(d), and will be
 made using the respective steel cost basis (CB) listed.
 
 118
 
 00195.12
 (b) Monthly Steel Materials Value (MV) and Base Steel Materials Value (BV) - The Monthly
 Steel Materials Value (MV) will be established by the Agency from the IDWPUSISTEEL1 Bureau
 of Labor Statistics (BLS), Producer Price Indexes (PPI) using non-seasonally adjusted indexes
 only. Preliminary numbers may be referenced on the IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI for 6 months or
 more before IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI determines they are final numbers.
 The Base Steel Materials Value (BV) for this Project will be the MV published on the ODOT
 Estimating website (see 00110.05(e)) for the month of the Bid Opening for this Project. The
 Agency will only publish values on the ODOT Estimating website for use after the
 IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI establishes the numbers as final numbers. The final values of MV
 and BV will be available at the ODOT Estimating website.
 The Agency has no control of when the IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI establishes final values. The
 Agency steel material price escalation/de-escalation adjustments made under 00195.12 through
 00195.12(d) may not be reflected on payments made to the Contractor for up to 2 months after
 the IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI applicable values become final. This timing for steel material
 price escalation/de-escalation adjustments is an agreed term of this Contract and shall not
 constitute late payment under ORS 279C.570, nor shall the Agency be responsible to pay interest
 on any such steel material price adjustments.
 If the Agency-selected index ceases to be available for any reason, the Agency in its discretion
 will select and begin using a substitute price source or index to establish the MV each month.
 The MV will only apply to Pay Items selected by the Contractor and provided in writing to the
 Project Manager from the Pay Item list contained under, and in the manner and within the time
 limits required by, 00195.12(d). The Agency does not guarantee that steel material will be
 available at any stated or implied materials price.
 (c) Monthly Steel Materials Price Adjustment - If the Contractor has properly informed the
 Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel escalation/de-escalation program as required
 by 00195.12(a) and 00195.12(d), a price adjustment evaluation will be made for the Pay Items
 individually selected. No adjustments will be made using the BV or MV until such time as they
 are listed as final values by the IDWPUSISTEEL1 BLS PPI. The price adjustment as calculated
 in this provision for a given Pay Item will use the MV for the month the Work associated with that
 Pay Item is performed and added to the monthly progress estimate. A price adjustment for that
 Pay Item will only be made if the MV for the month the Work associated with the Pay Item is
 performed and added to the monthly progress estimate differs by more than 10% from the BV. A
 price adjustment will be made, as and when required by 00195.12 through 00195.12(d), only for
 the Pay Items, if any, that were selected by the Contractor in the manner and within the time
 limits required under 00195.12(a) and 00195.12(d).
 The Monthly Steel Materials Price Adjustment will be determined as follows:
 • If the MV is within 10%  of the BV, there will be no adjustment.
 
 • If the MV is more than 110% of the BV, then:
 PA = (((MV-BV) ÷ BV) - 0.10 ) x (CB x PIP)
 • If the MV is less than 90% of the BV, then:
 PA = (((MV-BV) ÷ BV) + 0.10 ) x (CB x PIP)
 Where:
 PA = Price Adjustment, dollars
 MV = Monthly Steel Materials Value from BLS PPI for the month determined above (after
 becomes final)
 BV = Base Steel Materials Value from month of the Bid Opening (after becomes final)
 PIP = Amount paid for the Pay Item for the month for which the adjustment is made
 CB = Cost Basis for the applicable steel material, in percent (see 00195.12(d))
 119
 
 00195.20
 (d) Steel Materials Pay Item Selection - The Agency has a process using estimated quantities
 to determine which Pay Items containing steel material qualify for the steel escalation/deescalation program by meeting a minimum threshold, and are therefore included in the eligible
 Pay Items listed in the Special Provisions.
 
 For purposes of 00195.12 through 00195.12(d), "steel material" means structural and reinforcing
 steel, steel studs, sheet piling, guardrail, ductile iron pipe and other steel products used for the
 construction, reconstruction or major renovation of a road or Highway.
 The Contractor may elect to participate in the steel escalation/de-escalation program for this
 Project by marking the list in the Special Provisions, checking each box next to each Pay Item the
 Contractor wants included in the program and submitting this information in writing, signed and
 dated by the Contractor, to the Project Manager before or within 7 Calendar Days after the date
 of the preconstruction conference. The steel material price escalation/de-escalation clause for
 price adjustments for fluctuations in the cost of steel material will apply only to the Pay Items
 selected by the Contractor, from the Pay Item list included in the Special Provisions, and provided
 in writing to the Project Manager in the manner and within the time limits stated above.
 If the Contractor fails to inform the Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel
 escalation/de-escalation program in the manner and within the time limits stated above (or the
 Contractor otherwise elects not to participate in the program), the Contractor thereby elects not to
 participate in the program and forfeits all present and future rights to participate in the program for
 this Contract and this Project.
 00195.20 Changes to Plans or Character of Work:
 (a) Insignificant Changed Work - If the changes made under 00140.30 do not significantly
 change the character or unit cost of the Work to be performed under the Contract, the Agency will
 pay for such Work at the Pay Item price.
 
 If the Work involved in the change is measured on a lump sum basis and its character is not
 significantly changed, payment for the Changed Work will be determined:
 • As described in the applicable Section of the Specifications;
 • If not described there, on a theoretical unit price determined by dividing the Contractor's
 lump sum price by the estimated quantity of the Pay Item listed in the Special Provisions; or
 • If neither of the above apply, the Engineer will make an equitable adjustment.
 (b) Significant Changed Work - If the changes made under 00140.30 significantly alter the
 character, unit cost, or lump sum cost of the Work, the Agency will adjust the Contract.
 Adjustments will exclude any loss of anticipated profits. The parties shall agree upon the basis
 for payment and the amount of adjustment prior to the Contractor commencing the Changed
 Work. If the basis and amount cannot be agreed upon, the Engineer will make an equitable
 adjustment, which may increase or decrease the Contract Amount and Contract Time.
 
 Any such adjustments may be less than, but will not be more than the amount justified by the
 Engineer on the basis of the established procedures set out in Section 00197 for determining
 rates. This does not limit the application of Section 00199.
 The term "Significant Changed Work" shall apply only to that circumstance in which the character
 of the Work, as changed, differs materially in kind, nature, or unit cost from that involved or
 included in the originally proposed construction.
 
 120
 
 00195.50
 00195.30 Differing Site Conditions - Upon written notification, as required in 00140.40, the
 Engineer will investigate the identified conditions. If the Engineer determines that the conditions
 materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required to perform any Work
 under the Contract, an adjustment in the Contract Amount or Contract Time, excluding loss of
 anticipated profits, will be made, and the Contract modified accordingly, in writing. The Engineer will
 notify the Contractor as to whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 
 No Contract adjustment which benefits the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has
 provided the required written notice. Any such adjustments will be made according to 00195.20.
 00195.40 Unreasonable Delay by the Agency - If the Contractor believes that performance of all
 or any portion of the Work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time
 in excess of that originally anticipated or customary in the construction industry, due to acts or
 omissions of the Agency, or persons acting for the Agency, and that additional compensation,
 Contract Time, or both, are due the Contractor because of the suspension, delay or interruption, the
 Contractor shall immediately file a written notice of delay according to 00180.60. The Contractor
 shall then promptly submit a properly supported request for any additional compensation, Contract
 Time, or both, according to the applicable provisions in 00180.60 through 00180.80 and
 Section 00199.
 
 The Engineer will promptly evaluate a properly submitted request for additional compensation. If the
 Engineer determines that the delay was unreasonable, and that the cost required for the Contractor
 to perform the Contract has increased as a result of the unreasonable suspension, delay or
 interruption, the Engineer will make an equitable adjustment, excluding profit, and modify the
 Contract in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination and
 whether an adjustment to the Contract is warranted.
 Under this provision, no Contract adjustment will be allowed:
 • Unless the Contractor has provided the written notice required by 00180.60;
 • For costs incurred more than 10 Calendar Days before the Engineer receives the Contractor's
 properly submitted written request;
 • For any portion of a delay that the Engineer deems to be a reasonable delay, or for which an
 adjustment is provided for or excluded under other terms of the Contract; or
 • To the extent that performance would nevertheless have been suspended, delayed or
 interrupted by causes other than those described in this Subsection.
 00195.50 Progress Payments and Retained Amounts:
 (a) Progress Payments - The Agency's payment of progress payments, or determination of
 satisfactory completion of Pay Items or Work or release of retainage under 00195.50(d), shall not
 be construed as Final Acceptance or approval of any part of the Work, and shall not relieve the
 Contractor of responsibility for defective Materials or workmanship or for latent defects and
 warranty obligations.
 
 The estimates upon which progress payments are based are not represented to be accurate
 estimates. All estimated quantities are subject to correction in the final estimate. If the
 Contractor uses these estimates as a basis for making payments to Subcontractors, the
 Contractor assumes all risk and bears any losses that result.
 If the estimated amount due the Contractor for any given month is less than $1,000, the Agency
 will make no payment for that month unless requested by the Contractor.
 
 121
 
 00195.50
 (1) Progress Estimates - At the same time each month, the Engineer will make an estimate
 of the amount and value of Pay Item Work completed. The amount of Work completed will be
 the sum of the estimated number of units completed for unit price Pay Items plus the estimated
 percentage completed of lump sum Pay Items.
 
 The estimated value of the Work completed will then be determined by using the Contract unit
 price for unit price Pay Items, and by using one of the following methods to determine the
 value of the lump sum Pay Items:
 • The "theoretical unit price", when the Special Provisions contain an estimated number of
 units;
 • A Contractor-submitted, Engineer-approved Schedule of Values, when there is no
 theoretical unit price available; or
 • Engineer's determination, when there is neither an available theoretical unit price, nor an
 approved, Contractor-submitted Schedule of Values.
 The amounts to be allowed for lump sum Pay Items in progress payments will not exceed the
 reasonable value of the Work performed, as determined by the Engineer.
 Incidentals such as formwork, falsework, shoring, and cribbing shall be included in the unit
 prices for the various Pay Items requiring their use, unless specified as a separate Pay Item.
 No payment will be made for Pay Items that include Incidentals until units or portions of such
 Pay Item Work are in place and completed. The costs of Incidentals will be paid in proportion
 to the percentage of Pay Item Work completed.
 (2) Value of Materials on Hand - The Engineer will also make an estimate of the amount and
 value of acceptable Materials on hand, i.e., already delivered and stored according
 to 00195.60(a), to be incorporated into the Work.
 (3) Value of Work Accomplished - The sum of the values in (1) and (2) above will be
 collectively referred to in this Subsection as the "value of Work accomplished", subject to (4)
 below.
 (4) Limitations on Value of Work Accomplished - In determining the "value of Work
 accomplished", the Engineer's estimate will be based on the unit prices for the various Pay
 Items. Any amounts not included in progress payments due to substantial mathematical
 unbalancing of Pay Item prices will be included in the final payment issued according
 to 00195.90(b).
 (5) Reductions to Progress Payments - With each progress payment, the Contractor will
 receive a Contract payment voucher and summary setting forth the value of Work
 accomplished reduced by the following:
 
 • Amounts previously paid;
 • Amounts deductible or owed to the Agency for any cause specified in the Contract;
 • Additional amounts retained to protect the Agency's interests according to Subsection (e)
 below.
 (b) Retainage - The amount to be retained from progress payments will be 2.5% of the value of
 Work accomplished, and will be retained in one of the forms specified in Subsection (c) below. If
 the Agency determines that satisfactory progress is not being made on the Work, the Agency
 may withhold up to 5% of the value of Work accomplished from subsequent progress payments.
 No retainage will be withheld from Work performed as Force Account Work, escalation/deescalation, bonuses, or other items decided by the Agency.
 
 122
 
 00195.50
 As provided in 00170.65(a) additional retainage of 25% of amounts earned will be withheld and
 released according to ORS 279C.845 when the Contractor fails to file the certified statements
 required in ORS 279C.845, FHWA Form 1273, and 00170.65.
 (c) Forms of Retainage - Forms of acceptable retainage are specified below in Subsections (1)
 through (3). "Cash, Alternate A" is the Agency-preferred form of retainage. If the Agency incurs
 additional costs as a result of the Contractor's election to use a form of retainage other than
 Cash, Alternate A, the Agency may recover such costs from the Contractor by a reduction of the
 final payment.
 (1) Cash, Alternate A - Retainage will be deducted from progress payments and held by the
 Agency until final payment is made according to 00195.90, unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract.
 
 The Agency will deposit the cash retainage withheld in an interest-bearing account in a bank,
 savings bank, trust company, or savings association for the benefit of the Agency, as provided
 by ORS 279C.560(5). Interest earned on the account shall accrue to the Contractor. Amounts
 retained and interest earned will be included in the final payment made according to 00195.90.
 Any retainage withheld on Work performed by a Subcontractor will be released to the
 Contractor according to 00195.50(d).
 (2) Cash, Alternate B (Retainage Surety Bond) - Upon receipt of an approved retainage
 surety bond, the Agency will limit the amount of cash retainage withheld to $10,000. The
 surety bond must be in the bond form provided by the Agency. The bond must be provided by
 the same Surety that provides the Performance and Payment Bonds.
 
 If the Contractor elects this form of retainage, the Agency will withhold from progress payments
 up to 2.5% of the value of the Work accomplished as cash retainage until the retained amount
 equals $10,000. After that amount is retained, no further cash retainage will be withheld until
 the additional required retainage that would have been withheld exceeds the face amount of
 the retainage surety bond provided. Thereafter, retainage will be withheld from progress
 payments according to these Specifications. According to 00195.50(b), if at any time the
 Agency determines that satisfactory progress is not being made on the Work, the Agency may
 withhold up to 5% of the value of the Work accomplished from subsequent progress payments.
 If an acceptable retainage surety bond is provided, the Contractor shall notify all
 Subcontractors of the existence of the retainage surety bond and shall advise them of their
 rights under ORS 279C.560(7) and ORS 701.435.
 Amounts of retainage withheld under the provision will be included in the final payment
 according to 00195.90.
 Any retainage withheld on Work performed by a Subcontractor shall be released to the
 Contractor according to 00195.50(d).
 (3) Bonds, Securities, and Other Instruments - In accordance with ORS 279C.560, unless
 the Agency finds in writing that accepting a bond, security or other instrument poses an
 extraordinary risk that is not typically associated with the bond, security or other instrument,
 the Agency will approve the Contractor's written request to deposit bonds, securities or other
 instruments with the Agency or in a custodial account or other account satisfactory to the
 Agency with an approved bank or trust company, to be held instead of cash retainage for the
 benefit of the Agency. In such event, the Agency will reduce the cash retainage by an amount
 
 123
 
 00195.50
 equal to the value of the bonds, securities and other instruments. Interest or earnings on the
 bonds, securities and other instruments shall accrue to the Contractor.
 Bonds, securities and other instruments deposited instead of cash retainage shall be assigned
 to or made payable to the Agency and shall be of a kind approved by the Director of the
 Oregon Department of Administrative Services, including, but not limited to:
 • Bills, certificates, notes or bonds of the United States;
 • Other obligations of the United States or agencies of the United States;
 • Obligations of a corporation wholly owned by the federal government;
 • Indebtedness of the Federal National Mortgage Association;
 • General obligation bonds of the State of Oregon or a political subdivision of the State of
 Oregon;
 • Irrevocable letters of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008.
 The Contractor shall execute and provide such documentation and instructions respecting the
 bonds, securities and other instruments as the Agency may require to protect its interests.
 When the Engineer determines that all requirements for the protection of the Agency's interest
 have been fulfilled, the bonds and securities deposited instead of cash retainage will be
 released to the Contractor.
 (d) Release of Retainage - As the Work progresses, release of the amounts retained under (b)
 above will only be considered for Pay Items that have been satisfactorily completed. For
 purposes of this Subsection, a Pay Item will be considered satisfactorily completed only if all of
 the Work for the Pay Item is complete and all contractual requirements pertaining to the Pay Item
 and Work have been satisfied. Work not included in a Pay Item, or which constitutes part of an
 uncompleted Pay Item, will not be regarded as satisfactorily completed Work for the purposes of
 this Subsection.
 
 Beginning with the fourth month after First Notification and every third month thereafter, the
 Agency will release retainage for satisfactorily completed Pay Items in the Schedule of Items, or
 for satisfactorily completed Pay Items added by Contract Change Order. Retainage will be
 released with the scheduled progress payment for the fourth month after First Notification and
 with the scheduled progress payment for each third month thereafter. Within 10 Calendar Days
 of receipt of retainage, the Contractor shall pay to each Subcontractor all such released retainage
 that pertains to the Work of that Subcontractor.
 A determination of satisfactory completion of Pay Items or Work or release of retainage shall not
 be construed as acceptance or approval of the Work and shall not relieve the Contractor of
 responsibility for defective Materials or workmanship or for latent defects and warranty
 obligations.
 (e) Withholding Payments - The Engineer may withhold such amounts from progress payments
 or final payment as may reasonably protect the Agency's interests until the Contractor has:
 
 • Complied with all orders issued by the Engineer according to the Specifications; and
 • Satisfied all legal actions filed against the Agency, the Agency's governing body and its
 members, and Agency employees that the Contractor is obliged to defend. (See 00170.72.)
 Notwithstanding ORS 279C.555 or ORS 279C.570 or 00195.50(d), if a Contractor is required to
 file statements on the prevailing rate of wages, but fails to do so, the Agency will retain 25% of
 any amount earned as required in 00170.65.
 124
 
 00195.60
 (f) Prompt Payment Policy - Payments shall be made promptly according to ORS 279C.570.
 00195.60 Advance Allowance for Materials on Hand:
 (a) General - If the total value of Materials on hand is at least $1,000, or the total value of a
 single class of Materials on hand is at least $500, the Engineer may authorize an advance
 allowance for the Materials in the progress payments. The Agency will not make advance
 allowances on the Materials unless the following three conditions are satisfied:
 (1) Request for Advance Allowance - If Materials on hand meet the requirement of (2)
 below, an advance allowance will be made if:
 • A written request for advance allowance for Materials on hand has been received by the
 Engineer at least 5 Calendar Days before the pay period cutoff date; and
 • The request is accompanied by written consent of the Contractor's Surety, if required by
 the Agency.
 (2) Stored or Stockpiled Conditions - The Materials shall have been delivered and/or
 acceptably stored or stockpiled according to the Specifications and as follows:
 • At the Project Site;
 • On Agency-owned property;
 • On property in the State of Oregon on which the property owner has authorized storage
 in writing. The written authorization must allow the Agency to enter upon the property
 and remove Materials for at least 6 months after completion of the Project. The
 Contractor shall furnish a copy of the written permission to the Agency; or
 • On property outside the State of Oregon on which the property owner has authorized
 storage in writing, provided that such storage location is allowed by the Special
 Provisions or authorized in writing by the Engineer. The permit must allow the Agency to
 enter upon the property and remove Materials for at least 6 months after completion of
 the Project. The Contractor shall furnish a copy of the written permission to the Agency.
 To be eligible for advance allowance, the Materials shall:
 • Meet Specification requirements;
 • Have the required Materials conformance and quality compliance documents on file with
 the Engineer (see Section 00165);
 • Be in a form ready for incorporation into the permanent Work; and
 • Be clearly marked and identified as being specifically fabricated, or produced, and
 reserved for use on the Project.
 (3) Responsibility for Protection - The Contractor has full control and responsibility for the
 protection of Materials on hand from the elements and against damage, loss, theft, or other
 impairment until the entire Project has been completed and accepted by the Agency.
 If Materials are damaged, lost, stolen, or otherwise impaired while stored, the monetary value
 advanced for them, if any, will be deducted from the next progress payment.
 If these conditions in 00195.60(a)(1) through 00195.60(a)(3) have been satisfied, the amount of
 advance allowance, less the retainage described in 00195.50, will be determined by one of the
 following methods as elected by the Engineer:
 
 • Net cost to the Contractor of the Materials, f.o.b. the Project Site or other approved site; or
 125
 
 00195.70
 
 • Price (or portion of it attributable to the Materials), less the cost of incorporating the
 Materials into the Project, as estimated by the Engineer.
 (b) Proof of Payment - The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with proof of payment to the
 materials Suppliers for purchased Materials within 30 Calendar Days of the date of the progress
 payment that includes the advance allowance.
 If proof of payment is not provided, sums advanced will be deducted from future progress
 payments, and the Engineer will not approve further prepayment advance allowance requests.
 (c) Terminated Contract - If the Contract is terminated, the Contractor shall provide the Agency
 immediate possession of all Materials for which advance allowances have been received, as
 provided above. If, for any reason, immediate possession of the Materials cannot be provided,
 the Contractor shall immediately refund to the Agency the total amount advanced for the
 Materials. The Agency may deduct any amount not so refunded from final payment.
 00195.70 Payment under Terminated Contract - Payment for Work performed under a Contract
 that is terminated according to the provisions of 00180.90 will be determined under (a) or (b) of this
 Subsection.
 (a) Termination for Default - Upon termination of the Contract for the Contractor's default, the
 Agency will make no further payment until the Project has been completed. The Agency will
 make progress payments to the party to whom the Contract is assigned, but may withhold an
 amount sufficient to cover anticipated Agency costs, as determined by the Engineer, to complete
 the Project.
 Upon completion of the Project, the Engineer will determine the total amount that the defaulting
 Contractor would have been entitled to receive for the Work, under the terms of the Contract, had
 the Contractor completed the Work (the "cost of the completed Work").
 If the cost of the completed Work, less the sum of all amounts previously paid to the Contractor,
 exceeds the expense incurred by the Agency in completing the Work, including, without limitation,
 expense for additional managerial and administrative services, the Agency will pay the excess to
 the Contractor, subject to the consent of the Contractor's Surety.
 If the expense incurred by the Agency in completing the Work exceeds the Contract Amount, the
 Contractor or the Contractor's Surety shall pay to the Agency the amount of the excess expense.
 The Engineer will determine the expense incurred by the Agency and the total amount of Agency
 damage resulting from the Contractor's default. That determination will be final as provided
 in 00150.00.
 If a termination for default is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unjustified, it
 shall be deemed a termination for public convenience, and payment to the Contractor will be
 made as provided in Subsection (b) below.
 (b) Termination for Public Convenience:
 (1) General - Full or partial termination of the Contract shall not relieve the Contractor of
 responsibility for completed or performed Work, or relieve the Contractor's Surety of the
 obligation for any just claims arising from the completed or performed Work.
 (2) Mobilization - If mobilization is not a separate Pay Item, and payment is not otherwise
 provided for under the Contract, the Agency may pay the Contractor for mobilization expenses,
 
 126
 
 00195.90
 including moving Equipment to and from the Project Site. If allowed, payment of mobilization
 expenses will be based on cost documentation submitted by the Contractor to the Engineer.
 (3) All Other Work - The Agency shall pay the Contractor at the unit price for the number of
 Pay Item units of completed, accepted Work. For units of Pay Items partially completed,
 payment will be as mutually agreed, or, if not agreed, as the Engineer determines to be fair
 and equitable. No claim for loss of anticipated profits will be allowed. The Agency will
 purchase Materials left on hand according to 00195.80.
 00195.80 Allowance for Materials Left on Hand:
 (a) Purchase of Unused Materials - If Materials are delivered to the Project Site, or otherwise
 acceptably stored at the order of the Engineer, but not incorporated into the Work due to
 complete or partial elimination of Pay Items, changes in Plans, or termination of the Contract for
 public convenience according to 00180.90, and it is not commercially feasible for the Contractor
 to return them for credit or otherwise dispose of them on the open market; the Agency will
 purchase them according to the formula and conditions specified in Subsection (b) below.
 (b) Purchase Formula and Conditions:
 (1) Formula - The Agency will apply the following formula in determining the Contractor's
 allowance for Materials left on hand:
 
 Contractor's Actual Cost, plus 5% Overhead Allowance, minus Advance Allowances under
 00195.60, but no markup or profit.
 (2) Conditions - The Agency will not purchase the Contractor's Materials left on hand unless
 the Contractor satisfies the following conditions:
 
 • Requests the Agency's purchase of unused Materials;
 • Shows acquisition of the Materials according to 00160.10;
 • Shows that the Materials were acquired prior to the Agency change or termination;
 • Shows that the Materials meet Specifications; and
 • Provides receipts, bills and other records of actual cost of Materials delivered to the
 designated delivery points.
 00195.90 Final Payment:
 (a) Final Estimate - As soon as practicable after Final Inspection of the Project, as provided
 in 00150.90, the Engineer will prepare a final estimate of the quantities of the Pay Items
 completed. With this estimate of quantities as a base, the total amount due the Contractor will be
 determined according to the terms of the Contract, including, without limitation, any amounts due
 for Extra Work performed.
 (b) Final Payment - The amount of final payment will be the difference between the total amount
 due the Contractor and the sum of all payments previously made. All prior partial estimates and
 payments shall be subject to correction in the final estimate and payment.
 After computation of the final amount due, and after Final Acceptance of the Project, final
 payment will be mailed to the Contractor's last known address as shown in the records of the
 Agency.
 
 127
 
 00195.95
 Beginning 30 Calendar Days after the date of Third Notification, interest will begin to accrue at the
 rate established by ORS 279C.570 on any money due and payable to the Contractor as final
 payment, determined as described above. No interest will be paid on money withheld due to
 outstanding amounts owed by the Contractor under the provisions of 00170.10.
 (c) No Waiver of Right to Make Adjustment - The fact that the Agency has made any
 measurement, estimate, determination or certification either before or after completion of the
 Project, Final Acceptance, Agency assumption of possession of the Project Site, determination of
 satisfactory completion of Pay Items or Work or release of retainage under 00195.50(d) or
 payment for any part of the Work, shall not prevent either party from:
 
 • Showing the true amount and character of the Work;
 • Showing that any measurement, estimate, determination or certification is incorrect;
 • Recovering from the other party damages that may have been suffered because the other
 party failed to comply with the Contract.
 00195.95 Error in Final Quantities and Amounts:
 (a) Request for Correction of Compensation - If the Contractor believes the quantities and
 amounts detailed in the final Contract payment voucher, prepared by the Engineer according
 to 00195.90, to be incorrect, the Contractor shall submit an itemized statement to the Engineer
 detailing all proposed corrections.
 
 This statement must be submitted to the Engineer within 90 Calendar Days from the date the
 voucher was mailed to the Contractor, according to 00195.90(b). Any request for compensation
 not submitted and supported by an itemized statement within the 90 Calendar Day period will not
 be paid by the Agency. This does not limit the application of Section 00199.
 (b) Acceptance or Rejection of Request:
 (1) Consideration of Request - The Engineer will consider and investigate the Contractor's
 request for correction of compensation submitted according to 00195.95(a), and will promptly
 advise the Contractor of acceptance or rejection of the request in full or in part.
 (2) Acceptance of Request - If the Engineer accepts the Contractor's request(s) in full or in
 part, the Engineer will prepare a post-final Contract payment voucher, including all accepted
 corrections, and will forward it to the Contractor.
 (3) Rejection of Request - If the Engineer rejects the request(s) in full, the Engineer will issue
 a written notice of rejection and mail it to the Contractor.
 (4) Contractor Objection to Revised Voucher or Notice of Rejection - If the Contractor
 disagrees with the revised voucher or notice of rejection, the Contractor may request review
 according to the procedure specified in 00199.40. If the Contractor fails to submit a request
 for 00199.40 review within 30 Calendar Days after the Engineer mails a post-final Contract
 payment voucher or notice of rejection, the Contractor waives all rights to a claim based on
 errors in quantities and amounts.
 
 If the Engineer rejects the Contractor's request on the basis that the issue was not one that
 qualified for treatment under this Section, no review according to 00199.40 will be allowed.
 
 128
 
 00196.20
 Section 00196 - Payment for Extra Work
 Description
 00196.00 General - Only work not included in the Contract as awarded but deemed by the
 Engineer to be necessary to complete the Project (see 00140.60) will be paid as Extra Work.
 Regardless of alterations and changes, any item of Work provided for in the Contract will not
 constitute Extra Work. Payment for alterations and changes to Work will be made according
 to 00195.20.
 
 Compensation for Extra Work will be paid only for Work authorized in writing by the Engineer and
 performed as specified. Work performed before issuance of the Engineer's written authorization
 shall be at the Contractor's risk. Extra Work will be paid as determined by the Engineer, according
 to 00196.10 and 00196.20.
 Provisions and Requirements
 00196.10 Negotiated Price - If the Engineer can reasonably determine a price estimate for Extra
 Work, the Engineer may then give written authorization to the Contractor to begin the Extra Work.
 As soon as practicable, but within 10 Calendar Days after that authorization, the Contractor shall
 respond in writing to the Engineer's Extra Work price estimate by submitting to the Engineer an
 Extra Work price quote. The price quote shall detail the following items related to the Extra Work:
 
 • Types and amounts of Materials
 • Hours of Equipment use and hours of labor
 • Travel
 • Overhead and profit
 • Other costs associated with the proposed Extra Work
 Pending approval of the price quote, the Engineer will maintain force account records of the Extra
 Work. As soon as practicable, but within 10 Calendar Days of receipt of a properly supported price
 quote, the Engineer will review the price quote and advise the Contractor if it is accepted or rejected.
 The Engineer will not accept a price quote that cannot be justified on a Force Account basis. If the
 Contractor's price is accepted, the Engineer will issue a Change Order, and the Extra Work will be
 paid at the accepted price.
 00196.20 Force Account - If the Engineer and the Contractor cannot agree on a price for the Extra
 Work, the Engineer may issue an Extra Work order requiring the Extra Work to be paid as Force
 Account Work. Force Account Work records and payment will be made according to Section 00197.
 
 129
 
 00197.00
 Section 00197 - Payment for Force Account Work
 Force Account Work
 00197.00 Scope - The Materials, Equipment and labor rates and procedures established in this
 Section apply to Extra Work ordered by the Engineer to be performed as Force Account Work. With
 the exceptions identified in 00197.01(b), these rates and procedures also apply to other Work when
 according to other Sections this Section 00197 applies, including, without limitation, the following:
 
 • 00140.70 - Cost Reduction Proposals
 • 00195.20 - Changes to Plans or Character of Work
 • 00195.30 - Differing Site Conditions
 • 00199.30(b) - Claims Requirements
 00197.01 General:
 (a) Extra Work on a Force Account Basis - Before ordering Force Account Work, the Engineer
 will discuss the proposed work with the Contractor, and will seek the Contractor's comments and
 advice concerning the formulation of Force Account Work specifications. The Engineer is not
 bound by the Contractor's comments and advice, and has final authority to:
 
 • Determine and direct the Materials, Equipment and labor to be used on the approved Force
 Account Work; and
 • Determine the time of the Contractor's performance of the ordered Force Account Work.
 If the Engineer orders the performance of Extra Work as Force Account Work, the Engineer will
 record, on a daily basis, the Materials, Equipment, labor, and Special Services used for the Force
 Account Work during that day. The Engineer and the Contractor shall sign the record daily to
 indicate agreement on the Materials, Equipment, labor, and Special Services used for the Force
 Account Work performed on that day.
 The following shall be reflected on the daily record:
 • Materials used in the Force Account Work as directed by the Engineer, except those
 furnished and paid under rental rates for use of Equipment;
 • Equipment that the Engineer considers necessary to perform the Force Account Work.
 Equipment hours will be recorded to the nearest quarter hour;
 • Labor costs, including that of Equipment operators and supervisors in direct charge of the
 specific operations while engaged in the Force Account Work;
 • Special Services; and
 • The Engineer's and Contractor's signatures confirming its accuracy.
 (b) Other Work - When according to other Sections this Section 00197 applies, the following
 exceptions apply to the Work under those other Sections, except for Extra Work ordered by the
 Engineer to be performed as Force Account Work.
 
 • 00197.01(a) does not apply.
 • Cost Efficiency - The Agency will not be responsible for additional costs that are a direct or
 indirect result of the Contractor's inefficient means and methods or that reasonably could
 have been avoided if the Materials, Equipment, labor or services had been obtained at a
 more commercially reasonable cost.
 130
 
 00197.20
 • Standby Time - Equipment that is necessary for the Work but is not being operated to
 progress the Work will be considered to be on standby and will be limited to the standby
 rates and hour limitations in 00197.20(e). Equipment costs will be limited to a combination
 of operating time and standby time of not more than 8 hours in a 24 hour period or 40 hours
 in a 1 week period. The Equipment must be onsite and available for use to be eligible for
 standby time.
 For a period of 7 or fewer Calendar Days: If a continuous period of standby time for a piece
 of Equipment does not exceed 7 Calendar Days, the accumulated standby cost for that
 continuous period of standby time shall be limited to the standby rates and hour limitations
 in 00197.20(e).
 For a period of more than 7 Calendar Days: Unless the Engineer has otherwise agreed in
 advance in writing, if a continuous period of standby time for a piece of Equipment
 exceeds 7 Calendar Days, the accumulated standby cost shall be limited to:
 • For the first 7 Calendar Days, the standby rates and hour limitations in 00197.20(e), and
 • For the portion of the continuous period of standby time after the first 7 Calendar Days,
 the lesser of:
 • The standby rates and hour limitations in 00197.20(e); or
 • The cost for moving that piece of Equipment to and from the Project Site according
 to 00197.20(d).
 00197.10 Materials:
 (a) General - The Contractor will be paid for Materials actually used in the Force Account Work
 as directed by the Engineer, except for those furnished and paid for under rental rates included
 with the use of Equipment. Payments will be at actual cost, including transportation costs to the
 specified location, from the supplier to the purchaser, whether the purchaser is the Contractor, a
 Subcontractor, or other forces. All costs are subject to the provisions of this Subsection.
 (b) Trade Discount - If a commercial trade discount is offered or available to the purchaser, it
 shall be credited to the Agency, even though the discount may not have actually been taken. The
 Agency will not take any discounts for prompt or early payment, whether or not offered or taken.
 (c) Not Directly Purchased From Supplier - If Materials cannot be obtained by direct purchase
 from and direct billing by the supplier, the cost shall be considered to be the price billed to the
 purchaser less commercial trade discounts, as determined by the Engineer, but not more than the
 purchaser paid for the Materials. No markup other than actual handling costs will be permitted.
 (d) Purchaser-Owned Source - If Materials are obtained from a supply or source wholly or
 partly owned by the purchaser, the cost shall not exceed the price paid by the purchaser for
 similar Materials furnished from that source on Pay Items, or the current wholesale price for the
 Materials delivered to the Project Site, whichever is lower.
 00197.20 Equipment:
 (a) General - Equipment approved by the Engineer to perform the Force Account Work will be
 eligible for payment at the established rates only during the hours it is operated or on standby if
 so ordered by the Engineer. Equipment hours will be recorded on the daily record to the nearest
 quarter hour.
 
 Except as modified by these provisions, Equipment use approved by the Engineer will be paid at
 the rental rates given in the most current edition of the EquipmentWatch Cost Recovery (Blue
 131
 
 00197.20
 Book) published by EquipmentWatch, a division of Penton Business Media, Inc., and available
 from EquipmentWatch (phone 1-800-669-3282) (see 00110.05(e) for website).
 (b) Equipment Description - On the billing form for Equipment costs, the Contractor shall
 submit to the Engineer sufficient information for each piece of Equipment and its attachments to
 enable the Engineer to determine the proper rental rate from the Blue Book.
 (c) Rental Rates (without Operator):
 (1) Rental Rate Formula - Rental rates for Equipment will be paid on an hourly basis for
 Equipment and for attachments according to the following formula:
 
 Hourly Rate
 
 =
 
 Monthly Base Rate x Rate Adjustmen t Factor
 176 hours/mont h
 
 + Hourly Operating Rate
 
 Some attachments are considered "standard Equipment" and are already included in the
 monthly base rate for the Equipment.
 That information can be obtained from
 EquipmentWatch.
 (2) Monthly Base Rate - The monthly base rate used above for the machinery and for
 attachments represents the major costs of Equipment ownership, such as depreciation,
 interest, taxes, insurance, storage, and major repairs.
 (3) Rate Adjustment Factor - The rate adjustment factor used above will be determined by
 applying only the Model Year Adjustment to the Blue Book Rates. The Regional and User
 Defined Ownership/Operating Adjustments shall not apply.
 (4) Hourly Operating Rate - The hourly operating rate used above for the machinery and for
 attachments represents the major costs of Equipment operations, such as fuel and oil,
 lubrications, field repairs, tires or ground engaging components, and expendable parts.
 (5) Limitations - If multiple attachments are included with the rental Equipment, and are not
 considered "standard Equipment", only the attachment having the higher rental rate will be
 eligible for payment, provided the attachment has been approved by the Engineer as
 necessary to the Force Account Work.
 
 Rental will not be allowed for small tools that have a daily rental rate of less than $5, or for
 unlisted Equipment that has a fair market value of $400 or less.
 The above rates apply to approved Equipment in good working condition. Equipment not in
 good working condition, or larger than required to efficiently perform the work, may be rejected
 by the Engineer or accepted and paid for at reduced rates.
 (d) Moving Equipment - If it is necessary to transport Equipment located beyond the Project
 Site exclusively for Force Account Work, the actual cost to transport the Equipment to, and return
 it from, its On-Site Work location will be allowed as an additional item of expense. However, the
 return cost will not exceed the original delivery cost. These costs will not be allowed for
 Equipment that is brought to the Project Site for Force Account Work if the Equipment is also
 used on Pay Item or related Work.
 
 If transportation of such Equipment is by common carrier, payment will be made in the amount
 paid for the freight. No markups will be allowed on common carrier transportation costs. If the
 Equipment is hauled with the Contractor's own forces, transportation costs will include the rental
 rate of the hauling unit and the hauling unit operator's wage. If Equipment is transferred under its
 
 132
 
 00197.40
 own power, the rental rate allowed for transportation time will be 75% of the appropriate hourly
 rate for the Equipment, without attachments, plus the Equipment operator's wage.
 (e) Standby Time - If ordered by the Engineer, standby time will be paid at 40% of the hourly
 rental rate calculated according to this Subsection, excluding the hourly operating rate. Rates for
 standby time that are calculated at less than $1 per hour will not be paid. Payment will be limited
 to not more than 8 hours in a 24-hour period or 40 hours in a 1 week period.
 (f) Blue Book Omissions - If a rental rate has not been established in the Blue Book, the
 Contractor may:
 
 • If approved by the Engineer, use the rate of the most similar model found in the Blue Book,
 considering such characteristics as manufacturer, capacity, horsepower, age and fuel type;
 • Request EquipmentWatch to furnish a written response for a rental rate on the Equipment,
 which shall be presented to the Engineer for approval; or
 • Request that the Engineer establish a rental rate.
 (g) Outside Rental Equipment - If Contractor-owned or Subcontractor-owned Equipment is not
 available, and Equipment is rented from outside sources, payment will be based on the actual
 paid invoice.
 
 If the invoice specifies that rental rate does not include fuel, lubricants, field repairs, and
 servicing, an amount equal to the Blue Book hourly operating cost may be added for those items
 that were excluded.
 The Agency may reduce the payment when the invoice amount plus allowance is higher than the
 amount authorized under (c) through (f) of this Subsection.
 The provisions of 00180.20(c) apply to owner-operated Equipment.
 00197.30 Labor - The Contractor will be paid for all labor engaged directly on Force Account Work,
 including Equipment operators and supervisors in direct charge of the specific force account
 operations, as follows:
 (a) Wages - The actual wages paid to laborers and supervisors, if those wages are paid at rates
 not more than those for comparable labor currently employed on the Project, or at the recognized,
 current, prevailing rates in the locality of the Project.
 (b) Required Contributions - The actual cost of industrial accident insurance, unemployment
 compensation contributions, payroll transit district taxes, and social security for old age
 assistance contributions incurred or required under statutory law and these Specifications. The
 actual cost of industrial accident insurance is the National Council on Compensation Insurance
 (NCCI) rate for the assigned risk pool for the appropriate work class multiplied by the experience
 modification factor for the Contractor.
 (c) Required Benefits - The actual amount paid to, or on behalf of, workers as per diem and
 travel allowances, health and welfare benefits, pension fund benefits, or other benefits when such
 other benefits are required by a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract
 generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the Project.
 00197.40 Invoices for Special Services - Invoices for Special Services that reflect current market
 pricing may be accepted without complete itemization of Materials, Equipment, and labor costs, if
 the itemization is impractical or not customary. The invoice for Special Services shall show credit
 for commercial trade discounts offered or available.
 
 No percentage markup will be allowed other than that specified in 00197.80.
 133
 
 00197.80
 00197.80 Percentage Allowances - To the Contractor's actual costs incurred, as limited in this
 Section 00197, amounts equal to a percentage markup of such costs will be allowed and paid to the
 Contractor as follows:
 Subsection

 When a Subcontractor performs ordered Force Account Work, the Contractor will be allowed a
 supplemental markup of 8% on each Force Account Work order.
 These allowances made to the Contractor will constitute complete compensation for overhead,
 general and administrative expense, profit, and all other Force Account Work costs that were
 incurred by the Contractor, or by other forces that the Contractor furnished.
 No other
 reimbursement, compensation, or payment will be made.
 00197.90 Billings - Billings for Force Account Work by the Contractor shall be submitted for the
 Engineer's approval on forms provided by the Agency or approved by the Engineer. Billings for
 Materials (other than Incidental items out of the inventory of the Contractor or Subcontractors),
 rental Equipment from sources other than the Contractor or Subcontractors, and Special Services,
 shall be accompanied by copies of invoices for the goods and services. The invoices shall be fully
 itemized showing dates, quantities, unit prices, and complete descriptions of goods and services
 provided. Invoices for amounts of $10 or less per invoice are not required, unless requested by the
 Engineer.
 
 Costs included on the billings shall comply with 00197.01(a) and 00197.10 through 00197.40.
 When a billing for Force Account Work has been paid at the Project level, no further corrections will
 be made because of further review if those corrections amount to less than $10.

 Section 00199 - Disagreements, Protests, and Claims
 Description
 00199.00 General - This Section details the process through which the parties agree to resolve any
 disagreement concerning additional compensation or concerning a combination of additional
 compensation and Contract Time. (See 00180.80 for disagreements and claims concerning
 additional Contract Time only, and 00195.95 for disagreements and claims concerning correction of
 final compensation.) The Agency will not consider direct disagreements, protests, or claims from
 Subcontractors, Suppliers, or any other Entity not a party to the Contract.
 Provisions and Requirements
 00199.10 Procedure for Resolving Disagreements - When disagreements occur concerning
 additional compensation or a combination of additional compensation and Contract Time, the
 Contractor shall first pursue resolution through the Engineer of all issues in the dispute, including,
 without limitation, the items to be included in the written notice in 00199.20. If the discussion fails to
 provide satisfactory resolution of the disagreement, the Contractor shall follow the protest
 procedures outlined in 00199.20. If the Engineer denies all or part of the Contractor's protest, and
 the Contractor desires to further pursue the issues, the Contractor shall submit a claim for
 processing according to 00199.30.
 00199.20 Protest Procedure - If the Contractor disagrees with anything required in a Change
 Order or other written or oral order from the Engineer, including any direction, instruction,
 interpretation, or determination, or if the Contractor asserts a disagreement or dispute on any other
 basis, except 0195.95, that, in the Contractor's opinion, entitles or would entitle the Contractor to
 additional compensation or a combination of compensation and Contract Time, the Contractor shall
 do all of the following in order to pursue a protest and preserve its claim:
 (a) Oral Notice - Give oral notice of protest to the Engineer and outline the areas of
 disagreement before starting or continuing the protested Work.
 (b) Written Notice - File a proper written notice of protest on form 734-2887 with the Engineer
 within 7 Calendar Days after receiving the protested order. In the notice the Contractor shall:
 
 • Describe the acts or omissions of the Agency or its agents that allegedly caused or may
 cause damage to the Contractor, citing specific facts, persons, dates and Work involved;
 • Describe the nature of the damages;
 • Cite the specific Contract provision(s) that support the protest;
 • Include the estimated dollar cost, if any, of the protested Work, and furnish a list of
 estimated Materials, Equipment and labor for which the Contractor might request additional
 compensation; and
 • If additional compensation is estimated to be due, include the estimated amount of
 additional time required, if any.
 Failure to comply with these notice requirements renders the notice improper.
 (c) Records - Keep complete records of all costs and time incurred throughout the protested
 Work, and allow the Engineer access to those and other supporting records. Provide daily
 records of protested Work, on a weekly basis, on a schedule to be set by agreement with the
 Engineer.
 (d) Comparison of Records - Provide the Engineer adequate facilities for keeping cost and time
 records of the protested Work. The Contractor and the Engineer will compare records and either
 
 135
 
 00199.30
 bring them into agreement at the end of each day, or record and attempt to explain any
 differences.
 (e) Work to Proceed - In spite of any protest, proceed promptly with the Work ordered by the
 Engineer.
 (f) Evaluation of Protest - The Engineer will promptly evaluate all protests, after the Contractor
 has fully complied with the requirements described in 00199.20(b). If the protest is denied, the
 Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for full or partial denial. If a protest is
 found to be valid, the Engineer will, within a reasonable time, make an equitable adjustment of
 the Contract. Adjustment of time will be evaluated according to 00180.80.
 
 The Engineer has no responsibility for evaluating and may reject a protest that does not comply
 with 00199.20(b). If the protest is rejected, the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the
 reasons for rejection.
 (g) Protest Evaluation by Third Party Neutral - If the Engineer agrees that the Contractor has
 fully complied with the requirements described in 00199.20(b), and if the Engineer fully or partially
 denies, in writing, the Contractor's protest according to 00199.20(f), the Contractor may request
 that a mutually selected Third Party Neutral review the protest. Procedures for selecting, using,
 and paying for the cost of the Third Party Neutral will be specified by Change Order.
 
 If the Contractor does not accept the Engineer's evaluation of the protest, or either the Contractor
 or Engineer disagrees with the resolution recommended by the Third Party Neutral, the
 Contractor may pursue a claim as described in 00199.30.
 00199.30 Claims Procedure:
 (a) General - If the Contractor believes that additional compensation is due, or a combination of
 additional compensation and Contract Time, and has pursued and exhausted all the procedures
 provided in 00199.10 and 00199.20 to resolve a disagreement and protest, the Contractor may
 file a claim.
 
 The Agency's Contract is with the Contractor. There is no contractual relationship between the
 Agency and any Subcontractors, Suppliers or any Entity other than the Contractor. It is the
 Contractor's responsibility to fully evaluate any claim before presenting it to the Agency. In
 addition, when a claim includes Work done or costs incurred by any Subcontractors, Suppliers, or
 any Entity other than the Contractor, the Contractor remains solely responsible for presenting the
 claim to the Agency.
 Claims that include Work done or costs incurred by any Subcontractors, Suppliers, or any Entity
 other than the Contractor will not be considered by the Agency unless the Contractor has:
 • Completed and provided its own written evaluation of the claim;
 • Verified by its own independent review and evaluation of the amount of compensation
 sought; and
 • Certified the claim in accordance with 00199.30(b) (Part 10).
 (b) Claims Requirements - At any time during the progress of the Work, but not later than
 45 Calendar Days following the date of the Second Notification, the Contractor shall submit to the
 Engineer in writing, claims for additional compensation or a combination of additional
 compensation and Contract Time additional to that specified in the Contract. For a claim not
 submitted within the 45-day limit, that has not met the requirements of 00199.20, or is not filed as
 
 136
 
 00199.30
 provided in 00199.30, the Contractor waives any claim for additional compensation or for
 additional compensation and Contract Time, and the Agency may reject the claim.
 Written claims to the Engineer or the Agency by the Contractor shall be delivered to the Agency
 address shown in the Special Provisions, unless a different address is agreed to by the Engineer,
 and shall be delivered:
 • By U.S. Postal Service first class mail or priority mail (which at the sender's option may
 include certified or registered mail return receipt requested); or
 • By overnight delivery service of a private industry courier.
 Claims will be considered as having been received by the Agency:
 • At the time of actual receipt or 7 Calendar Days after the postmarked date when deposited
 for delivery by first class or priority mail, whichever is earlier; or
 • At the time of actual receipt or 3 Calendar Days after deposit with a private industry courier
 for overnight delivery service, whichever is earlier.
 The Agency reserves the right at any time and at any step in the claim decision or review process
 to request additional information, records or documentation related to the claim or the Contract
 either directly or through agents working toward resolution of the disputed or claimed events and
 issues.
 Claims shall be made in writing, and shall include all information, records and documentation
 necessary for the Agency to properly and completely evaluate the claim.

 If the Engineer determines that additional information, records or documentation is needed to
 allow proper evaluation of the claim submittal, the Engineer will request the information, records
 or documentation. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer within 14 Calendar Days, or as
 otherwise agreed by the parties, the required additional information, records and documentation.
 If the Engineer determines that the claim submittal with the additional information, records and
 documentation submitted is incomplete and not accepted as a claim, the Engineer will notify the
 Contractor in writing and the submittal will be rejected and will not be considered under 00199.40.
 (c) Records Requirements - The Contractor shall comply with 00170.07.
 (d) Compliance Required - Full compliance by the Contractor with the provisions of this Section
 is a condition precedent to the commencement of any lawsuit by the Contractor to enforce any
 claim.
 
 139
 
 00199.40
 00199.40 Claim Decision; Review; Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies - The Agency
 intends to resolve all claims at the lowest possible administrative level. The Engineer will also
 determine whether multiple claims should be advanced separately or together.
 
 If the Engineer denies the claim for additional compensation or a combination of additional
 compensation and Contract Time, in full or in part, according to 00199.40(a), the Contractor may
 request review of the denial. The disputed claim for additional compensation or a combination of
 additional compensation and Contract Time may then be resolved, in full or in part, at any of the four
 progressive steps of claim review procedure as specified in (b) through (e) of this Subsection.
 If the Engineer has denied a claim, in full or in part, for Contract Time only according to 00180.80, or
 has denied a claim, in full or in part, for correction of final compensation according to 00195.95,
 those disputed claims may then be resolved, in full or in part, at any of the four progressive steps of
 claim review procedure as specified in (b) through (e) of this Subsection.
 A person authorized by the Contractor to execute Change Orders on behalf of the Contractor must
 be present and attend all claim hearings. For all claims, all of the actions and review under each
 step of the review process shall occur before the review can be advanced to the next higher step.
 The Engineer may determine to skip the Step 1: Region Level Review, in which case the claim or
 claims will advance to Step 2: Agency Level Review.
 (a) Decision by the Engineer - The Engineer will, as soon as practicable, consider, investigate,
 and evaluate a Contractor's claim for additional compensation, or for a combination of additional
 compensation and Contract Time, if submitted as required by 00199.30.
 
 Once the Engineer determines the Agency is in receipt of a properly submitted claim, the
 Engineer will arrange a meeting, within 21 Calendar Days or as otherwise agreed by the parties,
 with the Contractor in order to present the claim for formal review and discussion.
 If the Engineer determines that the Contractor must furnish additional information, records or
 documentation to allow proper evaluation of the claim, the Engineer will schedule a second
 meeting, to be held within 14 Calendar Days or as otherwise agreed by the parties, at which the
 Contractor shall present the requested information, records and documentation.
 The Engineer will provide a written decision to the Contractor within 30 Calendar Days of the last
 Engineer-level meeting.
 If the Contractor does not accept the Engineer's decision, the Contractor may, within 10 Calendar
 Days of receipt of the written decision, request in writing that the Engineer arrange a review at
 Step 1 (see (b) below).
 (b) Step 1: Region Level Review - The Contractor shall request that the Engineer arrange a
 meeting with the Region-level reviewer in order to present the denied or partially denied claim for
 formal review and discussion. The meeting will take place within 21 Calendar Days of the
 Agency's receipt of the request, or as otherwise agreed by the parties.
 
 If the Region-level reviewer determines that the Contractor must furnish additional information,
 records or documentation to allow proper evaluation of the claim, the reviewer will schedule a
 second meeting, to be held within 14 Calendar Days, or as otherwise agreed by the parties, at
 which the Contractor shall present the requested information, records and documentation.
 The Region-level reviewer will provide a written decision to the Contractor within 30 Calendar
 Days of the last Region-level meeting.
 
 140
 
 00199.40
 If the Contractor does not accept the Step 1 decision, the Contractor may, within 10 Calendar
 Days of receipt of the written decision, request in writing that the Engineer arrange a review at
 Step 2 (see (c) below).
 (c) Step 2: Agency Level Review - The Contractor shall request a meeting with the Contract
 Administration Engineer (CAE) to present the claim for final Agency review. The presentation will
 take place within 21 Calendar Days of the Agency's receipt of the Contractor's written request, or
 as otherwise agreed by the parties.
 
 If the CAE determines that the Contractor must furnish additional information, records or
 documentation to allow proper evaluation of the claim, the CAE will schedule a second meeting to
 be held within 14 Calendar Days or as otherwise agreed by the parties, at which the Contractor
 shall present the requested information, records and documentation.
 The claim is subject to 00199.60, if not all of the records requested by the CAE were furnished.
 The CAE will provide a written decision to the Contractor, subject to 00199.60, if applicable,
 regarding the claim within 30 Calendar Days of the final Step 2 meeting.
 If the Contractor does not accept the Step 2 decision, the Contractor may, within 10 Calendar
 Days of receipt of the written decision, request in writing through the Engineer that the claim be
 advanced to Step 3 or 4 (see (d) and (e) below), as applicable. For purposes of determining
 which process to use for claims under Step 3 or 4 concerning a combination of additional
 compensation and Contract Time or for Contract Time only, the value of the claim or portion of
 the claim for Contract Time will be assumed to be the appropriate Liquidated Damages given
 in 00180.50 of the Special Provisions multiplied by the number of Calendar Days in question. If
 applicable, advancement of the claim is subject to the provisions of 00199.60 regarding waiver
 and dismissal of the claim or portions of the claim.
 (d) Step 3: Arbitration; Claims Review Board:
 (1) Claims Less Than $50,000 - At this step, the claim will be resolved by binding arbitration
 before a single arbitrator according to the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the
 American Arbitration Association or such other arbitration service and rules as agreed by the
 parties.
 
 Arbitration filing costs and any arbitrator's fees will be divided equally between the Agency and
 the Contractor.
 (2) Claims of $50,000 to $500,000 - At this step, the Contractor shall present the claim to a
 Claims Review Board (referred to as "Board") for consideration, review and recommended
 resolution. The Board will be comprised of three persons. ODOT will establish and maintain,
 in consultation with representatives of the construction industry, a panel of more than
 12 qualified individuals available to serve on Boards.
 
 If a claim within the scope of this step is properly referred for Board consideration and review,
 copies of biographies of all persons on the panel will be sent to the Contractor. Within
 20 Calendar Days after the biographies are mailed, the Contractor and the Engineer shall each
 nominate, in writing, three individuals from the panel available to serve on the Board.
 Within 10 Calendar Days after receipt of the nominations, the Contractor and the Engineer
 shall (a) each appoint to the Board one of the three individuals by the other, and (b) inform
 each other of the appointment. The two appointees, now Board Members, shall select an
 individual from the panel to serve as the third Board Member.
 
 141
 
 00199.40
 If the two Board Members cannot agree on the selection of the third Board Member, the Circuit
 Court in the county in which the Agency's main office is located will resolve the dispute. In this
 event, the Engineer will act through the Agency's legal counsel to request the Circuit Court to
 select an individual from the panel to serve as the third Board Member. Once the three Board
 Members have been selected, the three Board Members will decide which of the three will be
 the Board Chair.
 The Board may request the Engineer to designate a person not associated with the Contract to
 act as the recording secretary for the Board. The recording secretary is not a Board member,
 and will only assist the Board with administrative tasks related to its consideration and review
 of the referred claim.
 The Agency and the Contractor will equally share the costs of the Board members. The
 Agency will pay the costs of the Board's recording secretary.
 Members of the Board are to act impartially and independently in the consideration of facts and
 conditions surrounding the dispute. Board recommendations concerning the dispute are
 considered advisory only, shall not be binding on either party, and shall not constitute evidence
 in any legal proceeding for any reason.
 The Board will schedule and conduct an informal hearing at which the Contractor and the
 Agency will each have an opportunity to present evidence and argument. The Contractor and
 the Agency shall each submit a brief written summary of the claim to each Board member and
 the other party at least 10 Calendar Days before the hearing. Unless directed otherwise by the
 Board Chair, the summary shall include, for each issue under dispute:
 • A short statement describing the disputed issue;
 • A short position statement by the party on the issue;
 • A clear and concise explanation of the contractual basis for that position, including
 specific reference to Contract Documents;
 • A clear and concise description of the costs claimed for each issue, including, without
 limitation, specific documents demonstrating productivity, time and costs; and
 • Exhibits, including, without limitation, copies of plan sheets, extracts from the Standard
 Specifications and Special Provisions, correspondence, photographs, or other evidence
 to support the position.
 The proceedings will be conducted in a manner determined by the Chair, in consultation with
 the other Board members. Unless directed otherwise by the Chair, the hearing will be
 conducted according to the following guidelines:
 • The hearing will be informal;
 • The witnesses will not be sworn;
 • The Contractor will present its case first;
 • The Agency will then present its case;
 • Both parties will then have opportunity to present rebuttal;
 • The Board may ask questions and, to promote open discussion of the issues, both
 parties may respond or emphasize issues;
 • The parties' attorneys may observe the hearing and may respond to direct questions from
 the Board, but may not make factual presentations or legal arguments; and
 • The Board will conclude the hearing when it appears to the Board Chair that each party
 has had sufficient opportunity to support its case and the Board has no further questions.
 142
 
 00199.60
 Within 10 Calendar Days after conclusion of the hearing, the Board will forward to the Agency's
 designated representative and the Contractor the Board's written recommendation for
 resolution of the claim. Within 10 Calendar Days of its receipt of the Board's recommendation,
 the Agency will provide to the Contractor the Agency's written decision regarding the claim.
 If the Contractor does not accept the Agency's decision regarding the claim, the Contractor
 may proceed to litigation as described in Step 4 (see (e) below).
 (3) Claims Over $500,000 - If the Contractor and the Engineer agree, the parties may employ
 the Step 3 Board review process according to 00199.40(d)(2). If not, the Contractor may
 proceed to Step 4 (see (e) below).
 (e) Step 4: Litigation - This step applies to:
 
 • Claims over $500,000;
 • Appeals of arbitration awards issued in Step 3 at 00199.40(d)(1) above, according to
 ORS 36.600 through ORS 36.740; and
 • Agency decisions issued under Step 3 at 00199.40(d)(2) above.
 The Contractor must follow each step in order, and exhaust all available administrative remedies
 before resorting to litigation. Lawsuits must be properly filed in a court of competent jurisdiction
 within 6 months from the date of the final decision that exhausted the Contractor's available
 administrative remedies under this Section 00199.
 The Contractor shall comply with 00170.00.
 00199.50 Mediation - Notwithstanding the formal claims procedure specified above, the parties
 may enter into nonbinding mediation by mutual agreement at any time, in which case the parties
 may also agree to suspend the time requirements in Section 00199 pending the outcome of the
 mediation process. The rules, time and place for mediation, as well as selection of the mediator,
 shall be established by mutual agreement. Costs shall be divided equally between the Contractor
 and the Agency. Either party may terminate mediation at any time upon 5 Calendar Days' notice to
 the other, after which the time requirements of Section 00199 shall be automatically reinstated and
 shall resume from the point at which the time requirements were suspended.
 00199.60 Review of Determination Regarding Records - If not all of the records requested by
 the CAE under 00199.40(c) Step 2 were provided, then the CAE will determine:
 
 • If the records are of the type described in 00170.07; and
 • If the records have not been maintained or the records, or access to the records, has not been
 provided to the Agency as required by 00170.07 and this Section; and
 • If the records are material and necessary for proper evaluation of part or all of the claim; and
 • The portions of the claim for which the records are material and necessary for proper
 evaluation.
 If the CAE makes the foregoing determinations, then subject to the review process described below,
 all portions of the claim for which the CAE determined the records are material and necessary for
 proper evaluation are immediately waived and irrevocably dismissed.
 Even if the records have not been maintained or the records, or access to the records, have not
 been provided to the Agency in a given instance, the CAE may determine that sufficient records
 have been provided for the Agency to properly evaluate the claim in that instance. If the CAE
 makes this determination, the claim or portions of the claim will not be waived or dismissed under
 this provision.
 143
 
 00199.60
 If the Contractor does not accept the CAE's written determination that the records are material and
 necessary for proper evaluation of part or all of the claim, and the portions of the claim for which the
 records are material and necessary, the Contractor may, within 14 Calendar Days of receipt of the
 CAE's determination, request, in writing, a review of such determination by the Construction
 Engineer (CE). If the Contractor does not request a review of the CAE's determination, the CAE's
 determination shall then become the Agency's final determination as of the expiration of the time
 limit to request review.
 If the Contractor requests the review, the CE will schedule a review meeting within 14 Calendar
 Days, or as otherwise agreed by the parties, of when the CE receives the written review request.
 The Agency and the Contractor will each have an opportunity to explain their respective positions at
 the review meeting in a manner determined by the CE.
 Within 10 Calendar Days of the review meeting, the CE will issue a written proposed finding of
 whether the records not maintained or not provided to the Agency, or for which access was not
 provided to the Agency, are material and necessary for proper evaluation of part or all of the claim.
 If the CE makes that finding, then the CE will also make a proposed written finding as to what
 portions of the claim the records are material and necessary and, therefore, waived and irrevocably
 dismissed.
 Even if the records have not been maintained or the records, or access to the records, have not
 been provided to the Agency in a given instance, the CE may determine that sufficient records have
 been provided for the Agency to properly evaluate the claim in that instance. If the CE makes this
 determination, then the claim or portions of the claim will not be waived or dismissed under this
 provision.
 The CE's proposed findings will be submitted to the Contractor and the Agency's Director. The
 Contractor may submit written objections concerning the proposed findings to the Director within
 5 Calendar Days of receipt of such findings. If written objections are submitted, the Director may
 adopt or modify the proposed findings, and the Director's findings shall be the Agency's final
 determination. If no written objections are submitted within the 5 Calendar Day time limit, the CE's
 proposed findings shall then become the Agency's final determination as of the expiration of the time
 limit to submit written objections.
 If the Agency's final determination is that the records are material and necessary for proper
 evaluation of part or all of the claim, then the claim or that portion of the claim for which the records
 are material and necessary is waived and irrevocably dismissed, unless the Contractor provides the
 records, or access to the records, to the CAE within 5 Calendar Days of the Agency's final
 determination. If the Contractor provides the records, or access to the records, within this time limit,
 the CAE will schedule a meeting with the Contractor within 14 Calendar Days or as otherwise
 agreed by the parties, to discuss the records.
 The Agency's final determination that records are material and necessary for proper evaluation of
 part or all of the claim, and the Agency's final determination of the portions of the claim for which the
 records are material and necessary, shall be final and binding.

 the “standard length”. For purposes of this subsection a “standard length” for a skip stripe
 (10.0 feet) is defined in 00225.43(g)(1).
 
 184
 
 00225.84
 b. Length Method - Measurement will be the actual length of 4-inch wide stripe complete
 and in place. When measuring the actual length of 4-inch wide skip stripe, the skip interval
 will not be included in the measurement. The length of skip stripe may be determined by
 dividing the total length by 4.0.
 
 Temporary striping required for durable permanent pavement marking installation will be
 included in the measurement.
 Temporary striping will be measured on the length basis, of lines based on a nominal width
 of 4 inches. If the Plans call for, or the Engineer requires, stripes other than nominal 4-inch
 width, the measurement will be adjusted by converting to an equivalent length of a
 nominal 4-inch wide stripe.

 and bar removal will be measured as follows:
 (1) Stripe Removal - Stripe removal for stage construction will be measured on the length
 basis, determined by measuring the overall length of 4-inch line removed. The quantity of
 stripe removal will be the computed length of lines removed based on a nominal width
 of 4 inches. For computation purposes, the following apply:
 
 • The width of a line is the normal standard line width applied during original placement of
 solid no-passing lines, broken (skip) lines, edge lines, and any other lines normally
 4 inches wide.
 • The length of continuous lines is length of the line.
 • The length of broken (skip) stripes is the standard length of a skip line normally painted
 during original placement of the lines 10.0 feet of paint per 40 feet of Roadway length.
 Skip stripes may be counted.
 The length of standard 8-inch or 12-inch wide stripes will be adjusted by converting to
 equivalent length of 4-inch width line. No conversion or adjustment will be allowed for lines
 that are wider or longer due to improper placement or retracing deviations.
 (2) Legend and Bar Removal - Pavement legend removal and bar removal for stage
 construction will be measured on the area basis, of each legend and bar removed and will be
 the nominal area determined by multiplying the width times the length of the legend or bar. No
 deductions will be made for corners or irregular shapes.

 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste per month or more than 2.2 pounds of acutely hazardous
 waste per month, and has no accumulation limit, but ships all hazardous waste off-site
 within 90 days of generation.
 In addition to current Laws, comply with the following:
 • If the Project generator category is SQG or LQG, or if it requires a hazardous waste
 identification number, obtain a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site
 identification number from the DEQ. Pay all fees and complete the RCRA application form
 as follows:
 • List the Contractor as the Site Contact, the Site Operator, the Hazardous Waste Form
 Contact, and the Hazardous Waste Fee Contact.

 "[Contractor name] is responsible for the following: All hazardous waste management
 on-site for the duration of this construction Project, for delivery of the waste to a permitted
 recycling or disposal facility, and for all forms and fees associated with the hazardous
 waste management including cancellation of the RCRA site identification number at the
 end of the Project. ODOT is the owner of the waste and maintains long-term
 responsibility for the waste as required by RCRA, excluding all wastes generated solely
 from materials brought to the site by the Contractor, which remain the property of the
 Contractor."
 • The Contractor may sign hazardous waste manifests for the off-site shipment of
 hazardous wastes as the "offeror" rather than as the "generator".

 records on-site and readily available.
 • If the quantity of hazardous waste generated in a month changes the generator category,
 immediately implement the requirements for the new category and comply with them for the
 remainder of the year. Complete the new documentation and training requirements within
 30 Calendar Days of the change.
 • Ensure hazardous waste containers are clearly and visibly labeled with the contents and
 accumulation start date, compatible with the contents and in good condition. Store them in
 a designated weather-protected area that is secured from public access, has secondary
 containment adequate to contain a release, and has sufficient aisle space to safely
 maneuver containers and respond to spills (minimum 30 inches).
 • If hazardous waste will be treated on-site, obtain approval from DEQ and the Engineer for
 each specific treatment or recycling process, treat wastes within accumulation tanks or
 closed containers that meet RCRA requirements, conduct treatment within the storage time
 for the applicable generator category, maintain current copies of all required notifications

 benching allowed as a supplement.
 
 242
 
 00330.42
 (7) Foundation Benching - If existing ground surfaces or existing embankment surfaces are
 steeper than 1V:5H, bench the existing ground or embankment.
 
 Make the bottom bench at least 10 feet wide. Each succeeding bench shall penetrate the
 slope at least 3 feet horizontally beyond the vertical side of the previous bench, and be wide
 enough to operate placing and compaction Equipment. Each bench and embankment layer
 surface shall be brought to a Slope flatter than 1V:10H. The benching, placing and
 compaction operation shall be performed simultaneously from the bottom up.
 Place and compact the bench excavation material combined with new embankment material in
 layers to the thickness and compaction required in 00330.43.

 each layer of embankment, fills, and backfills, the upper 1 foot of Roadbeds in cuts and other
 earthwork that is to support any part of the Roadbed prism according to this subsection.
 
 Unless otherwise specified, compact in place the entire surface of each layer of all specified
 materials with a minimum of three Coverages, using Equipment made specifically for compaction.
 Select compaction Equipment based on the type of material being compacted and the layer
 thickness. Normal compaction Equipment consists of sheepsfoot rollers, tamping-foot rollers, grid
 rollers, pneumatic-tired rollers, and vibratory rollers. Routing of hauling and grading Equipment
 will not be accepted as adequate to achieve compaction, except as provided in 00330.42(a)(1).
 In the immediate vicinity of minor Structures as provided in 00330.42(c)(5), in holes, around and
 under isolated individual Rock fragments, and elsewhere where embankment and filling materials
 can or cannot be reached by normal compaction Equipment, compact with machine-operated
 pneumatic or mechanical tampers, or by hand methods if allowed, as required to ensure intimate
 contact between the backfill material and the Structure or fragment and provide thorough
 compaction.
 (b) Moisture-Density Testable Materials:
 (1) Test in-place materials for compaction according to the MFTP.
 (2) In-place materials shall meet the following moisture content, density, and deflection
 requirements, each of which has equal weight and each of which shall be satisfied:
 a. Moisture Content - Moisture content at the time of compacting the materials shall be
 prepared to within minus 4 percent to plus 2 percent of optimum moisture content. Material
 that does not contain sufficient moisture to obtain proper compaction shall be wetted and
 thoroughly mixed as directed. Material containing an excess of moisture shall be dried by
 manipulation, aeration, drainage or other means before being compacted.
 b. Density - After compaction of each layer the density shall be at least:
 
 • 95 percent of maximum density in Roadbed cuts, to a depth of 1 foot below
 established Subgrade elevation.
 • 95 percent of maximum density in embankments, fills, backfills, and specified portions
 of existing ground.
 c. Deflection Requirement - In addition to moisture-density testing, conduct at least one
 deflection test according to ODOT TM 158 for each 3 feet, or portion of 3 feet, of
 embankment placed. If the layer being tested exhibits any yielding, deflection, reaction or
 pumping, rework the area to provide acceptable test results prior to placement of any
 additional material.
 
 Conduct deflection tests, witnessed by the Engineer, on the finish grade of all Subgrades.
 During placement of Subbase, base Aggregates, or ACP, if deflection is observed, remove
 the ACP, Base, and Subbase Aggregates and correct the deflecting areas at no additional
 cost to the Agency.
 Provide a signed test report to the Engineer at the end of each shift after completing the
 required testing. At no additional cost to the Agency, remove and replace embankment
 constructed thicker than 3 feet that was not deflection tested.
 246
 
 00330.44
 (c) Non-Moisture-Density Testable Materials - When material is not moisture-density testable
 because Rock fragments in the material prevent moisture-density testing, place and compact the
 material as follows:
 
 • Place non-moisture density testable material in nearly horizontal layers with thickness not
 exceeding 12 inches.
 • Water or aerate the material to ensure each layer can be compacted to form a dense mass,
 free of pumping.
 • Compact each layer uniformly with a minimum of four full Coverages using a smooth drum
 vibratory roller.
 • Conduct at least one deflection test according to ODOT TM 158 for each layer of
 embankment placed. If the layer being tested exhibits any yielding, deflection, reaction or
 pumping, rework the area to provide acceptable test results prior to placement of any
 additional material.
 (d) Small, Irregular Fill Areas - The density requirements of 00330.43 do not apply to irregular
 fill areas that have a total volume of no more than 150 cubic yards outside of the travel lanes.
 Construct these areas according to the following:
 
 • Place embankment material in nearly horizontal layers with thickness not exceeding
 8 inches.
 • Water or aerate the material to ensure each layer does not deflect under the action of the
 roller used for compaction.
 • Compact each layer using a roller appropriate to the material being placed and as directed.
 Use a smooth-drum vibratory roller for sands and gravels; use a sheepsfoot or tamping-foot
 roller for Silts and Clays. The Engineer will determine the classification of the embankment
 Soil.
 • Compact each layer uniformly with a minimum of five full Coverages of the specified roller.
 • In areas not accessible to rollers, use compaction Equipment suitable for the area and
 compact each layer with sufficient Coverages to produce a firm unyielding surface.
 00330.44 Buttress, Inlay, or Shear Key - Remove the designated materials and construct the
 Buttress, inlay or shear key as follows:
 (a) Preparation - Do not start excavation for each segment until a stockpile of stone
 embankment material is immediately available at or near the site. Locate the stockpile at a site
 approved by the Engineer. The size of the stockpile shall be sufficient to fill one excavated
 segment.
 (b) Sequence of Construction - Excavate the area according to 00330.40 and 00330.41 to
 provide a backslope to the lines, Slopes and details shown, or as directed. Excavate and backfill

 Section 00335 - Blasting Methods and Protection of Excavation Backslopes
 Description
 00335.00 Scope - This Work consists of excavating in Rock using controlled blasting methods to
 achieve smooth, uniform and unfractured backslopes, and produce a free surface or shear plane in
 the Rock along the specified excavation backslope, and production blasting to facilitate excavation.
 00335.01 Definitions:
 Buffer Row - In multiple-row blasts in which perimeter control blasting techniques are used, the first
 row of production holes immediately adjacent to and drilled along a plane parallel to the perimeter
 control blast line. The buffer row is located between the production holes and the perimeter
 controlled blast line.
 Perimeter Controlled Blasting - The use of explosives and blasting accessories in carefully
 spaced and aligned drill holes. Perimeter controlled blasting techniques include presplitting and trim
 (cushion) blasting.
 Presplitting - A perimeter control blasting method in which the perimeter row of blast holes are
 drilled along the plane of the specified final excavation backslope and that utilizes reduced drill hole
 spacing and reduced diameter explosives decoupled from the drill hole wall, and whose initiation
 precedes the initiation of the adjacent production holes by a minimum of 25 milliseconds.
 Production Blasting - Fragmentation blasting in the main excavation area, usually using more
 widely spaced drill holes than controlled blast holes
 Trim (Cushion) Blasting - A perimeter control blasting method in which the initiation of the
 perimeter row of blast holes drilled along the plane of the specified final excavation backslope
 follows the initiation of the adjacent production holes within 25 to 75 milliseconds, if production holes
 are being employed in the blast.
 Materials
 00335.10 Materials - Furnish all explosives and blasting caps that are no more than 1 year old.
 Each blasting cap period shall come from one lot number.
 Construction
 00335.40 Blasting Methods:
 (a) General - Use methods in making excavations that do not shatter or loosen the backslopes
 and that produce smooth and uniform excavation slopes at the specified Slope angles. These
 include:
 
 • Perimeter Controlled Blasting - Use on the entire length of cut section in Rock or
 cemented materials that have backslopes of 1V:0.75H or steeper, even if the main
 excavation can be ripped.
 • Production Blasting - Blasting in the mass of Rock to be excavated shall be designed to
 control flyrock, minimize ground vibration and air blast, and result in loosened and
 fragmented in-place Rock of a size that can be removed, transported, or crushed to produce
 specified products. Lay out production blast holes in a consistent pattern that does not
 affect the perimeter control blast holes. Where production blast holes are made adjacent to
 Highways with specified closure restrictions, the volume of material blasted shall not exceed
 256
 
 00335.40
 the Contractor's ability to remove the blasted material from the adjacent Highway within the
 specified closure time.
 (b) Safety and Flyrock Control - Use techniques that effectively limit and control flyrock. Clear
 the site of all boulders or other material as directed prior to beginning blasting Work. Following
 every blast, observe the entire blast area for a minimum of 5 minutes before reentering or
 commencing Work in the area.
 
 Be responsible for the storage, transportation, and handling of explosives, their use, and the
 results of all blasting operations according to 00170.94.
 Cover all blast areas that are within 200 feet of residences, facilities or above-ground utilities
 using appropriate blast containment mats or an approved equivalent method.
 Discontinue blasting operations, as directed, if it is apparent that the methods employed are not
 producing acceptable results or the safety of the public, the Contractor's employees or adjacent
 property is being jeopardized.
 (c) Preblast Survey - Offer, in writing, to perform a preblast survey for owners and occupants of
 all buildings, Structures, and utilities within the distance of the blast specified in 00335.40(e). If
 the offer is accepted, use an Agency-approved survey form, signed and completed by an
 independent third party, and submitted to the Engineer and Contractor at least 72 hours before
 blasting begins. Deliver a copy of the survey form and copies of any photos taken to the owners
 and occupants.
 (d) Blasting Plan - Provide a separate blasting plan for each cut that requires blasting, prepared
 by a person qualified and experienced in blasting Work. Each plan shall cover individual major
 Rock cut areas or Rock production from a material source. Similar minor Rock cut areas of less
 than 50 cubic yards, as well as utility and culvert trenches, may be covered as a group in one
 generalized blasting plan.
 
 Submit the blasting plans for the Engineer's review at least 7 Calendar Days before beginning
 drilling and blasting Work for excavations of 3,000 cubic yards or smaller, and 14 Calendar Days
 for drilling and blasting Work requiring any perimeter controlled blasting and or excavations of
 more than 3,000 cubic yards.
 The blasting plans will be reviewed for conformance with the Specifications and any concerns will
 be discussed with the Contractor. Submit any proposed changes to the blasting plans in writing
 to the Engineer for review before implementation. Submittal of blasting plans is for quality control
 and record-keeping purposes.
 Review of blasting plans by the Engineer does not relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for
 the accuracy and adequacy of the plans and the resulting safety when implemented in the field.
 Each blasting plan shall contain the full details of the drilling and blasting patterns, vibration,
 flyrock, and noise reduction methods, blast area security measures and traffic control that the
 Contractor proposes to use, and the following information:
 • Station limits of proposed shot.
 • Removal of overburden.
 • Plan and Cross Section diagrams of proposed drill pattern for controlled and production
 blast holes including buffer rows, free face, burden, blast hole spacing, blast hole diameters,

 15 milliseconds.
 • 600 feet for shots using between 50 and 250 pounds of explosives per time delay of
 15 milliseconds.
 • 1,250 feet for shots using more than 250 pounds of explosives per time delay of
 15 milliseconds.
 Provide notification, in writing, once, at least 48 hours before blasting begins, and again on the
 Day the blasting operations occur.
 Do not begin detonation of the blast until the Agency representative is ready to videotape the
 blast, or until the Engineer is prepared to witness the blast.
 (f) Blasting Test Sections - Demonstrate the adequacy of each proposed blasting plan by
 means of test shots in each cut or excavation before beginning full-scale blasting. Do not
 proceed with remaining drilling and blasting until acceptable test blast results have been
 demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 
 In areas where perimeter controlled blasting techniques are being employed, drill and blast short
 representative test sections not exceeding 100 feet in length. Excavate a section not less than
 20 feet wide exposing the full height of the lift for examination. In areas where no perimeter
 controlled blasting techniques are being employed, determine effectiveness of the test section
 based on the material placement, cut slope stability, fragmentation and control of ground
 vibration, air blast and flyrock.
 Do not drill ahead of the test blast area, except as provided in 00335.41(a)(6), until the test
 section has been evaluated. The Contractor may be directed to use test section lengths less than
 100 feet.
 If the results of the test shots are unacceptable revise the methods, techniques and procedures,
 at no additional cost to the Agency, so that the results achieved will be acceptable. No further
 drilling and blasting will be allowed until the revised methods are reviewed according to
 00335.40(d) and verified by additional test shots.
 If, during the progress of the Work, the methods of drilling and blasting do not produce acceptable
 results within the tolerances specified, drill, blast and excavate additional test sections until a
 technique is determined that will produce acceptable results.
 (g) Blasting According to Plan - After the Engineer has reviewed the blasting plan and
 determined that test sections have demonstrated acceptable results, perform all perimeter
 controlled and production blasting according to the plan that produced acceptable results. Notify
 the Engineer when any changes in conditions or results are observed. On the Day of each
 blasting occurrence and before detonation of the blast, the supervisor or blasting specialist in
 
 258
 
 00335.41
 charge shall certify, in writing, that the shots being carried out are consistent with the reviewed
 blasting plan.
 (h) Blasting Report - Submit a blasting report detailing the blast outcome within 48 hours of
 making each blast. Include in the report the following:
 
 • Drill logs and notes regarding conditions encountered in the drill holes, including a
 description of encountered subsurface conditions such as open joints, soft or fractured Rock
 zones, groundwater conditions, hole alignment, and drilling problems.
 • Any variations from the submitted Blasting Plan, including any changes to explosives type or
 amount, loading dimensions, hole spacing, and initiation sequence and delay times.
 • All blast monitoring documentation.
 • A copy of color video recording of blast area(s) before, during, and after each blast, with
 sound, a minimum format of 720p resolution, and in a format commonly used for viewing
 with a computer or DVD player.
 • A comment section that includes the Contractor's evaluation of the blast performance, any
 unusual conditions or situations during the blast, and any misfires.
 • Details of all damage incurred and details of all neighbors' complaints or comments.
 (i) Suspension of Blasting - If damage to existing facilities or adjacent property occurs due to
 blasting, immediately suspend blasting and report damage to the Engineer. Discontinue blasting
 operations if the methods of drilling and blasting do not produce acceptable results within the
 tolerances specified.
 Before resuming blasting operations, revise the Blasting Plan and take other appropriate
 measures as necessary to correct the unacceptable blasting results. Submit the revised Blasting
 Plan to the Engineer. Do not resume blasting until authorized by the Engineer.
 00335.41 Controlled Blasting Methods:
 (a) Presplitting:
 (1) Attach mechanical devices to all drilling Equipment used to drill the presplit holes to
 determine, within an accuracy of 1, the angle at which the drill steel enters the Rock.
 (2) Drill presplit holes with a minimum diameter of 2 1/2 inches and a maximum diameter of
 3 inches.
 (3) Start presplit drill holes along the presplit line within 3 inches of the dimensions shown on
 the blasting plan. Holes located beyond this tolerance will be rejected. Completely fill the
 rejected holes with stemming material at no additional cost to the Agency. Drill new presplit
 holes with the proper spacing. Rejected holes will not be measured for payment.
 (4) Control the drilling operations to ensure that presplit hole alignment does not vary from the
 plane of the planned slope by more than 9 inches either parallel or normal to the slope.
 Presplit holes exceeding these limits will not be paid for unless, in the Engineer's opinion,
 satisfactory slopes are being obtained.
 (5) The length of presplit holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 30 feet unless the
 Contractor can demonstrate to the Engineer's satisfaction that hole alignment can be
 maintained within the above tolerances. Upon satisfactory demonstration, and with written
 permission of the Engineer, the length of holes may be increased to a maximum of 60 feet. If
 
 259
 
 00335.42
 more than 5 percent of the presplit holes are misaligned in any one lift, reduce the height of the
 lifts until the 9-inch alignment tolerance is met.
 (6) Drill presplit holes a minimum of 30 feet longitudinally beyond the limits of the production
 holes to be detonated or to the end of the cut. Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer in
 writing, remove all overburden, including any loose or decomposed Rock, before drilling the
 presplitting holes.
 (7) When the cut height will require more than one lift, a maximum offset of 18 inches between
 lifts will be allowed to allow for drill Equipment clearance. Adjust the Slope angle of lower lifts
 to compensate for drill offsets and any drift that may have occurred in upper lifts.
 (8) Use only explosives manufactured specifically made for presplitting in the presplit holes.
 The maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater than half the
 diameter of the presplit hole. Bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) will not be allowed in
 the presplit holes.
 (9) Determine that the presplit hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth before placing
 charges. Exercise all necessary precautions so the placing of the charges will not cause
 caving of material from the walls of the holes.
 (10) Detonation of explosives in each hole in a presplit shot may be delayed, providing the
 hole-to-hole delay is no more than 25 milliseconds.
 (11) Drill the presplit holes with a minimum spacing of 10 times the presplit hole diameter, and
 a maximum spacing of 14 times the presplit hole diameter.
 (b) Trim (Cushion) Blasting - When the horizontal distance from the new proposed slope face
 to the existing Rock face is less than 15 feet, the Contractor may trim blast instead of presplitting.
 The requirements in 00335.41(a) for presplitting also apply to trim blasting, by changing the
 words "presplit" and "presplitting" to "trim blasting". If trim blasting burdens are less than 6 feet or
 zones of weakness in the Rock are observed, submit a hole loading diagram that reflects the site
 conditions.
 (c) Buffer Row - Locate the buffer hole line a minimum of 3 feet away from the perimeter control
 blast line, or 1 foot for every inch of buffer hole diameter, whichever is greater. Space buffer row
 holes 3 to 5 feet center-to-center. The explosive load in buffer holes shall not exceed 50 percent
 of the full explosive load that could be placed in a 3-inch production hole. Initiation of the buffer
 holes shall be on a delayed sequence toward a free face.
 00335.42 Production Blasting - Do not drill any row of production blast holes closer than 6 feet to
 the perimeter controlled blast line. Where necessary to minimize damage to the Rock backslope, a
 row of buffer holes may be drilled between the perimeter controlled blast line and the production
 blast holes. Except for the bottom lift, do not extend production holes below the bottom of the
 controlled blast holes. Do not exceed 6-inch diameter for production holes. Detonate production
 holes on a delay sequence documented in the blasting plan.
 00335.43 Scaling - Remove all loose, hanging, or potentially dangerous Rock on the excavated
 surface by scaling during the completion of the excavation of each lift or test section. Do not begin
 drilling the next lift until this Work has been completed, as directed.
 
 Scale the slopes throughout the Contract at the frequency required to remove loose or overhanging
 material.
 
 260
 
 00335.90
 Use a suitable standard steel mine scaling rod to hand-scale the slopes. Other methods such as
 machine scaling, hydraulic splitters or light blasting may be used instead of, or to supplement,
 hand-scaling, if allowed.
 Measurement
 00335.80 Measurement - The quantities of perimeter controlled blast holes will be measured on
 the length basis and will be determined by dividing the cut slope surface area by the perimeter
 controlled blast hole spacing. The cut slope surface area will be determined by Cross Section
 measurement from the top of the blasted Rock to the finished ditch bottom elevation.
 
 The quantities shown in the Contract Schedule of Items have been computed from a theoretical plan
 length using 30-inch hole spacing. The actual quantities will depend on field conditions and results
 from blasting test sections.
 Payment
 00335.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of perimeter controlled blast holes will be paid for at
 the Contract unit price, per foot, for the item "Perimeter Controlled Blast Holes".
 
 Payment will be payment in full for furnishing and placing all Materials, and for furnishing all
 Equipment, labor, and Incidentals necessary to complete the Work as specified.
 No separate or additional payment will be made for blasting, scaling, or loosening materials for
 excavation.
 When the Contract Schedule of Items does not indicate payment for Work performed under this
 Section, no separate or additional payment will be made. Payment will be included in payment
 made for the appropriate items under which this Work is required.

 Section 02010
 
 Store materials according to 00165.75.
 00344.11 Water - Furnish water meeting the requirements of Section 00340.
 Construction
 00344.40 Preparation - Before starting Subgrade Work, including backfill, complete all
 underground work contemplated in the area of the Subgrade. This requirement includes work by
 the Contractor, by the Agency, or by others. Drain all depressions or ruts which contain water.
 00344.41 Addition of Stabilizing Material - Apply stabilizing materials at a uniform rate as
 specified using Equipment and methods that will ensure uniformity of distribution. The use of blade
 graders to distribute lime will not be allowed. Allow only Equipment that is used for watering,
 applying and mixing the stabilizing material to pass over the material until after it is mixed into the
 Soil. Add water, if necessary, during mixing operations to provide optimum moisture content.
 00344.42 Mixing - Perform mixing operations until the treated Subgrade material is uniform and
 free of streaks or pockets and all material, other than stones, will pass a 1-inch sieve. Do not allow
 the content of stabilizing material to vary by more than plus or minus 1 percent from the amount
 specified.
 00344.43 Finishing - Immediately after mixing the treated Subgrade, grade the mixture to specified
 line, grade and Cross Section and compact the mixture to the specified density. Compact and finish
 within 12 hours after compaction begins. If the Contractor has not compacted and finished the
 material within 12 hours, loosen the mixture and add stabilizing material and water as directed.
 Remix the freshened material, regrade and recompact, at no additional cost to the Agency. During
 
 265
 
 00344.44
 compaction, maintain the mixture at proper grade and Cross Section and at optimum moisture
 content.
 00344.44 Curing - Limit traffic over treated Subgrade to Equipment that does not cause any
 damage to the Subgrade and that does not visibly deflect, ravel or wear the surface. Keep the
 finished surface moist and protect from rutting, spalling, displacement and disfiguration for a period
 of 7 days, or until a subsequent Course of material is placed, which will prevent drying of the mixture
 by evaporation or absorption.
 00344.45 Compaction:
 (a) Achieve the required density of treated Subgrade materials as specified in 00330.43(b).
 (b) Compact the Subgrade until it is firm and unyielding. Unyielding means no more than
 1/4 inch deflection of the Subgrade when proof-rolled with a fully loaded 10 to 12-cubic yard
 dump truck. Test and proof-roll within 24 hours prior to placing base material on the Subgrade.
 (c) Over-excavate areas of visible deflection to a depth of 12 inches or more below Subgrade, as
 directed. Place fabric, backfill the over-excavated Subbase area up to the Subgrade elevation
 with a single Lift of 1 1/2" - 0 crushed Rock and compact. Apply the compactive effort until the
 density of the top 6 inches of the Subbase Rock is as specified in 00641.44(a). In addition,
 proof-roll these areas to verify they are firm and unyielding as specified above.
 (d) Notify the Engineer if the specified compaction is not attained. The Contractor may be
 required to use a modified compaction procedure or apply additional compactive effort. If
 approved materials meeting the Specifications cannot be compacted to the required density
 regardless of compactive effort or method, the Engineer may reduce the required density or direct
 that alternative material be used. Do not proceed with finishing or compaction of the Subgrade
 until the Contractor is able to compact the material to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 00344.46 Tolerances:
 (a) Rework areas found to be deficient in thickness by more than 3/4 inch, and add fresh
 stabilizing material in an amount equal to one-half the original amount.
 (b) Finish the surface of the treated Subgrade so that it does not vary by more than 0.06 foot
 from the established line, grade, and Cross Section and be free of ruts, depressions, and
 irregularities. When tested with a 12-foot straightedge, the maximum variation of the finished
 surface from the testing edge is 3/4 inch.
 Measurement
 00344.80 Measurement - The quantities of treated Subgrade will be measured on the area basis,
 measured along the lines and grades of the area actually treated.
 
 The quantities of Soil-stabilizing Materials will be measured on the dry weight basis. Packaged
 Materials will be accepted at the net weight shown by the manufacturer, subject to periodic
 verification and approval. Provide a certificate with each shipment together with a certified copy of
 the weight of each delivery. Measurement of stabilizing Material will not include any which is lost,
 displaced, used in reworking, used in restoration Work or used contrary to direction.

 00350.41 Geotextile Installation Requirements:
 (a) General:
 
 269
 
 00350.41
 (1) Placement:
 a. Surface Preparation - Prepare the surface receiving the geotextile to a smooth
 condition free of obstructions, depressions and debris unless otherwise directed. Do not
 drag the geotextile on the ground or mishandle in any way.
 
 Loosely place the geotextile without wrinkles so placement of the overlying material will not
 tear the geotextile. Lap or sew the geotextile at the ends and sides of adjoining sheets as
 specified.
 b. On Slopes - Place the geotextile with the machine direction oriented up-down the slope.
 Lap the upper sheets over the lower sheets. When the geotextile is placed on a Slope
 steeper than 6V:1H, securely anchor the laps to the ground surface with pins or stakes as
 necessary to prevent the slippage and tearing of the geotextile. Start placement of fill
 material on the geotextile at the toe of the slope and proceed upwards.
 c. Where Exposed to Water - If geotextiles are placed under water or in areas where
 water will flow, the geotextile may be placed with the machine direction parallel to the
 direction of water flow instead of the placement direction specified in 00350.41(a)(1)(b).
 Overlap sheets so the upstream sheet is placed over the top of the downstream sheet.
 Adequately secure the geotextile to prevent slippage. As the geotextile is placed under
 water, place the backfill material on it to the required thickness. Do not place geotextile
 more than 50 feet ahead of the specified cover material.
 (2) Overlaps - Minimum overlap requirements for geotextiles are:
 Application
 
 Drains
 Embankment Stabilization
 Pavement Overlays
 Riprap and Rock Buttresses
 Roadbed Subgrade Stabilization
 
 Minimum Overlap
 Requirements (Inch)
 12
 24
 *
 24
 24
 
 * Use sufficient overlap to ensure closure, but not more than 6 inches.
 If the Engineer determines the specified overlap is not sufficient, increase the overlap to
 provide adequate coverage or, if approved by the Engineer, sew the geotextile together in the
 field. If field-sewn, the provisions of 00350.20 and 00350.41(a)(3) apply.
 (3) Field Seams:
 a. General - When field-sewn seams are required, make them as follows:
 
 Sew field seams with polymeric thread consisting of polypropylene, polyester or kevlar, and
 as resistant to deterioration as the geotextile being sewn. Use a color of thread that
 contrasts with the geotextile being sewn so the stitches are exposed for inspection when the
 geotextile is placed. Seams shall meet the testing requirements of 02320.11(b).
 b. Stitch Requirements - Use two rows of lock-type stitching, Type 401, to make the
 seams, as shown. The two rows of stitching shall be 1/2 inch apart with a tolerance of plus
 or minus 1/4 inch and not cross except for restitching.
 c. Minimum Seam Allowance - The minimum seam allowance (the minimum distance
 from the edge of geotextile to the nearest stitching) is:
 
 270
 
 00350.41
 Seam Type (See Plans)
 
 Flat or Prayer Seam, Type SSa-1
 "J" Seam, Type SSn-1
 Butterfly-folded Seam, Type SSd-1
 
 Minimum Seam
 Allowance (Inch)
 1 1/2
 1
 1
 
 d. Seam Type - Obtain the geotextile manufacturer's recommendation for the type of seam
 and stitch to be used. If the Contractor does not obtain and provide the foregoing technical
 information use a "J" seam with at least three stitches per 1 inch. The flat, or prayer, seam
 may be used for repair of damaged in-place geotextile.
 (4) Protection of Geotextile - Protect the geotextile at all times from ultraviolet (UV) rays,
 contamination by surface runoff and construction activities.
 
 Traffic or construction Equipment will not be allowed directly on the geotextile except as
 authorized in 00350.41(f)(5) or as directed.
 During installation, cover the geotextile with specified cover material as soon as possible. Do
 not leave in uncovered condition for more than 5 days.
 Place cover material on the geotextile in such a manner that the geotextile is not torn,
 punctured or shifted. Use a minimum 6-inch thick cover layer or twice the maximum
 Aggregate size, whichever is thicker. Do not end-dump cover material directly on geotextiles
 other than riprap geotextile.
 Limit construction vehicles in size and weight so rutting in the initial layer above the geotextile
 is not more than 3 inches deep or half the layer thickness, whichever is lesser. Do not turn
 vehicles on the first layer.
 (5) Repair of Geotextile - Repair or replace all torn, punctured or contaminated geotextiles
 during construction at no cost to the Agency. Repair by placing a patch of the specified
 geotextile over the affected area. Overlap the existing geotextile with the patch according
 to 00350.41(a)(1). Where geotextile seams are required to be sewn, repair any damaged
 sheet by sewing unless otherwise indicated on the Plans or Special Provisions, or as directed.
 (b) Drainage Geotextile - When used in trenches for drains, place the geotextile in the trench as
 shown on the Plans to loosely conform to the shape of the trench with no wrinkles or folds.
 (c) Embankment Geotextile - Construct embankment stabilization according to details shown
 on the Plans. Place the geotextile layers so the geotextile machine direction is transverse to the
 embankment centerline. Spread the geotextile so all slack and wrinkles are eliminated.
 Construct embankment in uniform layers according to Section 00330.
 (d) Riprap Geotextile - Place geotextile behind and beneath riprap, Buttresses, inlays, shear
 keys and erosion control applications according to the details shown. Demonstrate to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer that the combination of the Rock-fill drop height and the thickness of
 any Aggregate cushion, when specified or required, is adequate to prevent puncturing or
 damaging the geotextile when placing the riprap or stone embankment material. If an Aggregate
 cushion is used, place according to 00350.41(a)(4). In addition, the following limits apply:

 and not visible.
 (e) Subgrade Geotextile - For Roadbed Subgrade separation, prepare the Subgrade according
 to Section 00330.
 
 Correct geotextile failures, as evidenced by Soil pumping or Roadbed distortion, by removing any
 covering material in the affected area and placing a geotextile patch on the exposed geotextile
 according to 00350.41(a)(5). Cover the patch with the specified cover material and compact
 before proceeding.
 (f) Pavement Overlay Geotextile:
 (1) General - Place geotextile and Pavement overlay in four basic steps:
 
 • Surface preparation
 • Sealant application
 • Geotextile placement
 • Overlay placement
 (2) Weather Limitations - Do not place sealant and geotextile unless the weather limitations
 of 00745.40 are met, as appropriate, except the minimum air temperature shall be 50 F for
 paving grade asphalt sealant placement and 60 F for asphalt emulsion sealant placement.
 (3) Surface Preparation - Prepare the Pavement surface on which the sealant is to be placed
 according to 00730.42 and the following:
 
 • Clean and fill cracks exceeding 1/8 inch width with a bituminous crack filler from the QPL.
 • Repair minor irregularities or depressions as directed.
 • Allow crack filling material to cure before placing geotextile.
 • Where the Pavement is severely cracked, rutted, deformed or otherwise distressed, place
 a Leveling Course as directed instead of extensive surface preparation.
 (4) Sealant Application - Use a normal paving grade asphalt. A cationic or anionic emulsion
 may be used as approved. Do not use cutbacks or emulsions that contain solvents.
 
 Uniformly spray the asphalt sealant at normal application temperature by means of a pressure
 distributor conforming to 00350.21 on the prepared dry Pavement surface. Apply at the rate
 of 0.20 - 0.30 gallon per square yard, or as recommended by the geotextile manufacturer or as
 directed.
 If using emulsions, increase the application rate 50 percent or as directed. Some underlying
 surfaces may require a higher application rate. Within street intersections, on steep grades or
 in other zones where vehicle speed changes are commonplace, reduce the normal application
 rate by 20 percent or as directed.
 The target width of the sealant application shall be the geotextile width plus 6 inches. Apply
 the sealant only as far in advance of the geotextile installation as appropriate to ensure a tacky
 surface at the time of geotextile placement. Place the geotextile the same Day as the sealant.
 Do not allow traffic on the sealant. Clean excess asphalt from the road surface.
 
 272
 
 00350.90
 (5) Geotextile Placement - Place the geotextile into the sealant using mechanical or manual
 laydown Equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of
 wrinkling or folding from the water (break) before placing the geotextile.
 
 Slit wrinkles or folds exceeding 1 inch and lay flat. Shingle-lap not more than 6 inches in the
 direction of the paving. Broom and/or pneumatic roll to maximize geotextile contact with the
 Pavement surface. Additional hand-placed sealant material may be required at laps as
 determined.
 Limit traffic to necessary construction Equipment and emergency vehicles on the geotextile
 before and during paving unless otherwise directed. Turn the paver and other vehicles
 gradually. Keep turning to a minimum to avoid geotextile movement and damage. Avoid
 abrupt starts and stops.
 (6) Overlay Placement - Place the overlay the same Day the geotextile is placed. Remove
 sealant that bleeds through the geotextile. Do not windrow asphalt concrete material on the
 geotextile ahead of the paving machine. Do not use an asphalt concrete material pickup
 machine.

 Construction
 00396.40 Surface Preparation - Before applying shotcrete to Rock surfaces, remove all loose
 material and vegetation and clean with air, water jets or other approved means. Remove loose
 material from Soil surfaces with air jets.
 
 Do not place shotcrete on any surface which is frozen, spongy or where there is free water.
 Dampen the surface before applying shotcrete.
 00396.41 Shotcrete Blanket Thickness Control - Control shotcrete blanket thickness by installing
 noncorrosive pins, nails or other gauging devices normal to the face so that they protrude the
 required shotcrete thickness outside the face. Place the pins on a maximum 5 foot square pattern.
 When welded wire fabric reinforcement is used, place at least a 1 inch cover of shotcrete over the
 wire fabric.
 
 284
 
 00396.47

 least 8 inches and secure with tie wire.
 00396.44 Weep Holes - Do not drill holes larger than 3 inches in diameter. Install the drain pipe
 before applying shotcrete. Extend the end of the pipe 1 inch to 3 inches outside the slope. Protect
 pipe ends during shotcreting and clean weep holes after shotcrete is placed.
 00396.45 Batching and Mixing Shotcrete:
 (a) Dry-Mix Process - Batch cement/Aggregate mix by weight or volume. Predampen the drymix after it flows out of the packaging but before it flows into the main hopper in order to ensure
 that the premix will flow at a uniform rate. Do not use predampened cement/Aggregate mix in the
 Work if it is allowed to stand more than 45 minutes.
 (b) Wet-Mix Process - Batch and mix wet-mix shotcrete according to ASTM C94.
 00396.46 Batching and Mixing Steel Fibers - Determine the procedure for adding steel fibers to
 the shotcrete. Obtain Engineer's approval. Demonstrate the procedure in the field for approval
 before production operation begins. If fibers are added at the nozzle, uniformly distribute the fibers
 throughout the mortar matrix without isolated concentrations. If fibers are added to the dry or wet
 mix process, use a screen having a mesh of 1 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inches to prevent any fiber balls from
 entering the shotcrete line, unless it is demonstrated that fiber balls are not being formed without a
 screen. Do not add fibers to the dry or wet mix at a rate faster than can be blended with the other
 ingredients without forming balls or clumps. Bulk fibers that have a tendency to tangle together shall
 pass through a vibrating screen or be sifted into the mix so they enter it as individual elements and
 not as clumps.
 00396.47 Shotcrete Application - Apply shotcrete from the lower portion of the area to the top so
 rebound does not accumulate on the portion of the surface that still has to be covered. Hold the
 nozzle at a distance and at an angle approximately perpendicular to the working face so rebound
 material will be minimal and compaction will be maximized. Shotcrete shall emerge from the nozzle
 in a uniform and continuous flow. When, for any reason, the flow becomes intermittent, divert the
 nozzle from the Work until uniform and continuous flow resumes. A nozzle person's helper,
 equipped with an air blowout jet, shall attend the nozzle person at all times during the placement of
 shotcrete to keep the working area free from rebound.
 
 Do not work rebound material into the finished product. Rebound is defined as the shotcrete
 constituents which fail to adhere to the surface to which the shotcrete is being applied. Do not
 salvage it or include it in later batches.
 Shooting will be suspended if:
 • High wind prevents the nozzle person from proper application of the material.
 • The temperature is below 40 F.
 • External factors, such as rain, wash cement out of the freshly placed material or cause sloughs
 in the Work.
 Taper construction joints over a distance of at least 12 inches to a thin edge. Thoroughly wet the
 surface of such joints before any adjacent section of shotcrete is placed. Do not use square
 construction joints.
 285
 
 00396.48
 Remove dummy areas, sags, or other defects and replace with a new layer, at no additional cost to
 the Agency. Replace any fabric reinforcement that is damaged with lapped and tied wire fabric.
 Allow previous layers of shotcrete to take initial set before applying additional layers of shotcrete.
 Clean all loose material before applying additional layers.
 00396.48 Finishing and Curing - Leave the shotcrete surface in a natural gun finish.
 
 Apply Type 2, white-pigmented curing compound immediately after gunning to cure the shotcrete.
 Keep shotcrete surfaces from freezing for at least 7 Calendar Days after application. Any curing
 compound in contact with exposed welded wire fabric, anchor bars and previous shotcrete surfaces
 shall be sandblasted before placing subsequent shotcrete.
 Measurement
 00396.80 Measurement - The quantities of shotcrete will be measured on the area basis along the
 finished shotcrete surface area.
 Payment
 00396.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of shotcrete will be paid for at the Contract unit price,
 per square yard, for the item "Shotcrete Slope Stabilization".
 
 Payment will be payment in full for furnishing and placing all Materials, and for furnishing all

 Use pressure gauges or load cells commonly used in the testing of Rock bolts and anchors.
 Perform lateral testing by attaching a steel cable to the anchor and connecting it to a load cell at the
 base of the slope. The cable shall not come in contact with the slope below the crest of the slope.
 Position the load cell far enough away from the toe of the slope that the cable under tension is near
 parallel to the slope. Determine applied test loads with either a calibrated pressure gauge or a load
 cell conforming to 00398.21.
 A pullout test consists of loading the anchor assembly to the minimum pullout capacity. The anchor
 is acceptable if it sustains this load for 10 minutes with no loss of load.
 00398.47 Wire Mesh Installation and Cable Net Installation - Install gabion wire mesh, high
 tensile strength wire mesh, or cable net systems as shown and according to the following:
 (a) Wire Mesh Slope Protection - Place gabion wire mesh with the fabric curl toward the slope.
 Loop the fabric over the top horizontal support rope and attach to itself with high-tensile steel
 fasteners or lacing wire as shown. Do not tension the fabric in any direction. Allow it to remain
 loose to increase its dampening effect on rolling rocks.
 
 Lap the gabion or high tensile strength wire mesh or cable net system as shown. If horizontal
 laps are needed, lap the upper fabric over the lower fabric to avoid the possibility of falling
 material hanging up on the lap. Locate the bottom of the fabric so material dislodged under the
 fabric can fall freely from the bottom, but will not flow or bounce onto the Roadway. Secure the
 ends of all lacing wires to the fabric with a minimum of one and one-half turns.
 (b) Post-Supported Wire Mesh Slope Protection - Place gabion or high tensile strength wire
 mesh for post-supported wire mesh slope protection according to 00398.47(a). Adjust the

 turnbuckles at the ends of the top horizontal support rope for a maximum sag of 1 inch between
 any two support posts.
 00398.48 Support Rope and Post Retaining Rope Attachment - For post-supported wire mesh
 slope protection and post-supported Rock protection screen behind barrier or guardrail, install top
 horizontal support ropes on the posts as shown. Ensure that the top horizontal support rope will
 move freely in the U-bolt hangers. Use one continuous length of cable for each complete section of
 screen. Attach the top horizontal support rope to the end anchors as shown. Tension the rope so
 that the in-place wire mesh will be fully supported. Take up additional tension with turnbuckles.
 Ensure that a minimum of 4 inches of take-up remains in the turnbuckle when full tension has been
 applied.
 
 In addition, for post supported wire mesh protection, install the post retaining ropes to the anchors
 and support posts as shown. Tension the ropes with the turnbuckles so that the cable is taut but
 does not bend the support post toward the slope when the wire mesh is installed. Ensure that a
 minimum of 2 inches of take-up remains in the turnbuckle when full tension has been applied.
 00398.49 Barrier Mounted Rock Protection Screen - Install concrete barrier according to
 Section 00820 and as shown. Attach protective screen to the concrete barrier as shown.
 00398.50 Rock Reinforcing Bolts and Rock Reinforcing Dowels:
 (a) General - Protect Rock reinforcing bolts and Rock reinforcing dowels at all times from
 damage and corrosion. Corrosion, pitting or damage to the Rock reinforcing bolt will be cause for
 rejection. Damage includes, but is not limited to, abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds, and weld splatter.
 Prior to installation, remove all mill scale, flaking rust, and grease.
 
 Drill holes to the diameter and depth recommended by the manufacturer, and at least 6 inches
 longer than the bolt or dowel. Unless otherwise directed, align drill holes normal to the Rock face.
 Maintain a driller’s log for each bolt and dowel boring that records, at a minimum, the relative
 Rock hardness, drilling rate, and groundwater conditions. Provide driller’s logs to the Engineer on
 a weekly basis.
 Place centralizers on Rock bolts and dowels on 10-foot centers prior to installation of the bar, with
 a minimum of two centralizers per anchor. Locate an inner centralizer within 2 feet of the end of
 the bar. Locate an outer centralizer within 3 feet of the Rock face.
 Maintain at least three-quarters of the surface area of the bearing plate in contact with the Rock
 face. Chip out surrounding Rock as necessary to provide this contact and ensure that the axis of
 the bolt is within 5 degrees of perpendicular to the bearing plate. Where necessary, a bearing
 pad may be used to achieve the required contact and angle between the installed bolt and the
 bearing plate, or where the Rock beneath the bearing plate is not sound. Allow sufficient cure
 time for bearing pads constructed with cementitious materials.
 Clean the drill holes of all drill cuttings and debris prior to installing the bolts or dowels. Install
 and proof test as follows:
 (b) Rock Reinforcing Bolts:
 (1) Installing Mechanical Bolts - Install bolts immediately after cleaning the drill hole.
 Tension each bolt to the design load before grouting. Conduct proof testing of each bolt as
 described below. Place grout in the drill hole to fill the space between the bolt and the sides of
 the hole, and to fully encapsulate the bolt. If necessary, control leakage of grout into Rock
 seams using approved methods and as directed. Pump the grout to the far end of the drill hole
 and continue pumping until grout is forced out of the de-airing tube at the face of the hole.
 
 298
 
 00398.51
 After testing and grouting, cut the bolt off, if necessary, so that no more than 3 inches extends
 beyond the nut. Treat the cut steel according to 02530.71.
 (2) Installing Grouted Bolts - Install bolts immediately after cleaning the drill hole. Within
 24 hours of installing the bolt, place grout to fill the Rock bond length and half the unbonded
 length. Start at the far end of the drill hole and fill to the extent shown. Record the quantity of
 grout and grout pressures.
 
 Allow the first placement of grout to cure fully before tensioning or applying any load. Conduct
 proof testing of each bolt as described in 00398.50(b)(3). Within 24 hours of tensioning the
 Rock bolt, fill the remainder of the drill hole with grout using a tremie tube. Check the grout
 level within 24 hours of completing the second stage grouting, and top off with additional grout
 using a tremie tube as necessary to fill the annular space. After testing and grouting, cut off
 any excess bolt length so that no more than 3 inches extends beyond the nut. Treat the cut
 steel according to 02530.71.
 (3) Proof Testing Bolts - Tension each installed bolt to 120 percent of the design load, using
 a calibrated hollow ram hydraulic jack. Hold that tension for a minimum of 10 minutes. Any
 loss of load during the 10-minute time period will result in failure of the test. If a bolt fails this
 test, the bolt will be rejected. Install, at no additional cost to the Agency, a replacement bolt in
 a separate hole adjacent to the failed bolt, and repeat the test. The Engineer may require
 additional proof testing if any bolt fails.
 (c) Rock Reinforcing Dowels:
 (1) Installing Dowels - Install dowels immediately after cleaning the drill hole. Place the grout
 mix in the drill hole according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After installation of the
 plate and nut, torque the nut to a nominal 100 foot-pounds to ensure proper seating against
 the Rock surface.
 Conduct proof testing of Rock reinforcing dowels as described
 in 00398.50(c)(2). After testing, cut off any excess bolt length so that no more than 3 inches
 extends beyond the nut. Treat the cut steel according to 02530.71
 (2) Proof Testing Dowels - Proof test at least 10 percent of the installed dowels, but not less
 than three dowels. The Engineer will interpret the results. Tension the Rock reinforcing dowel
 to 10 kips with a calibrated hollow ram hydraulic jack. Hold the load for 10 minutes with no
 loss of load. A Rock reinforcing dowel will be considered to have failed if any movement of the
 dowel occurs. The Engineer may require additional proof testing if any Rock reinforcing dowel
 fails. Replace failed dowels with a new dowel installed in a separate hole, at no additional cost
 to the Agency.
 00398.51 Flexible Rockfall Barrier Systems - Provide for a representative (the "Field
 Representative") from the proprietary flexible rockfall barrier system vendor or manufacturer to be
 present at the start of system construction. Before beginning Work involving the flexible Rockfall
 barrier system, the Contractor's supervisory personnel, together with any Subcontractors and their
 supervisory personnel who are to be involved in the flexible Rockfall barrier system installation
 Work, and the representative from the proprietary flexible rockfall barrier system vendor or
 manufacturer shall meet with the Engineer for a flexible rockfall barrier system preconstruction
 conference at a time mutually agreed upon. If all invitees are not in attendance, reschedule the
 flexible rockfall barrier system preconstruction conference for the start of system construction.
 
 Ensure that the Field Representative is available as needed during the construction of the flexible
 rockfall barrier system to provide instructions and recommendations, and to assist the Contractor or
 Engineer. Follow instructions and recommendations of the Field Representative, as approved by
 the Engineer.
 
 299
 
 00398.52
 00398.52 Anchored Wire Mesh Slope Protection - Install high tensile strength steel mesh at the
 locations shown.
 (a) General - Complete clearing, grubbing and scaling prior to placing mesh, to maximize contact
 with the ground surface and prevent bridging on exposed vegetation or Boulders between anchor
 nails.
 (b) Mesh Installation - Install mesh so as to conform to the slope surface and to the elevations
 shown, to the extent practicable. Provide a minimum of 5 feet mesh coverage above the crest of
 the cut slope to fully accommodate a minimum of one row of anchor nails. Extend the lateral
 coverage of the anchored wire mesh slope system to provide a minimum of 6 feet of mesh
 coverage onto adjacent Soil cut, Rock, or undisturbed ground. Where installations terminate near
 road grade, hold the bottom of the mesh 5 feet above the Roadside ditch. Adjust final row nail
 spacing to properly secure the bottom of the mesh.
 
 During installation, temporarily secure the mesh at the top of the slope, as needed, to facilitate
 installation. Construct any required temporary anchoring according to the Contractor’s approved
 work plan.
 Install boundary rope anchors as shown and according to 00398.43(a) and 00398.44(a).
 Centralizers and pullout testing are not required for boundary rope anchors.
 No Equipment operation is allowed on slope areas that have been covered with mesh.
 Connect adjacent mesh panels as shown, using connection clips.
 Diagonal cutting of the high tensile strength mesh is not allowed. If needed, use spreading tools
 obtained from the manufacturer to facilitate the passage of drill bits through the mesh openings.
 (c) Anchor Nail Installation - The general layout and spacing pattern of the anchors is as
 shown. Adjust the final constructed pattern to fit the slope shape and stabilization requirements,
 as directed. Determine the type of anchor nail (predrilled or self-drilling) appropriate for the
 subsurface conditions encountered. Document the nail type installed at each location and
 provide this documentation to the Engineer when requested.
 
 Maintain a driller’s log for each anchor nail installation, recording relative Rock hardness, drilling
 rate, and groundwater conditions. Provide driller’s log to the Engineer on a weekly basis.
 For nails to be installed in predrilled holes, drill a nominal 3-inch diameter hole perpendicular to
 the slope surface. Over-drill each hole a minimum of 6 inches beyond the required length of the
 nail.
 Grout the nails by placing grout through a tremie tube attached to the side of the nail until the
 grout is approximately 8 inches below the ground surface.
 For self-drilling nails, use the sacrificial drill bit to advance the nail to the prescribed depth. Inject
 cement grout as the nail is advanced, in order to fully encapsulate the nail.
 For installations through Soil, excavate a nominal 14-inch diameter by 8-inch deep hole around
 each nail head to accommodate the diamond plate and to ensure optimal load transfer from the
 nail head to the mesh.
 Clean grout remnants from the threads of the nail so that proper tensioning can be achieved.
 Install spike plates, washers, nuts and associated hardware according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations and as shown.
 300
 
 00398.90
 (d) Anchor Nail Proof Testing - Once the cement grout has achieved its initial set at three days,
 install the spike plate and nut, and tension each anchor nail to the load capacity shown. After
 10 minutes, test the tension in the anchor nail with the calibrated torque wrench for use as part of
 the approved work plan submittal. If a nail fails this test, replace the nail with an additional nail
 installed in a separate hole. If testing indicates that the required tension cannot be achieved,
 increase drill hole depth and/or diameter as required to obtain a successful test.
 After testing, cut off any excess nail, so that no more than 3 inches extends beyond the nut.
 Treat the cut steel according to 02530.71.
 (e) Supplemental Anchor Nails - Supplemental anchors may be needed to accommodate slope
 geometry. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of supplemental anchor nail locations. Install and test
 supplemental anchor nails as described above. Supplemental anchor nails do not replace pattern
 anchor nails and will not be accepted as replacements for rejected pattern anchor nails.

 (a) Within Paved Areas to Be Preserved - Excavate trenches for pipe installation by the open
 excavation method, unless otherwise directed. Do not disturb the adjoining Pavement more than
 necessary.
 (b) Open Trench Limit - Limit the length of open trench to 100 feet, or as allowed. Related
 resurfacing shall be completed within 800 feet of the open trench limit.
 (c) Trench Width - Keep the trench width at the ground surface to the minimum necessary to
 install the pipe in a safe manner, but not less than 24 inches. In all cases, make trenches of
 sufficient width to allow for shoring and to permit proper jointing of the pipe and backfilling of
 material along the sides of the pipe. Refer to the Standard Drawings for minimum trench widths
 for various diameter pipes. Make excavations for manholes and other Structures wide enough to
 provide a minimum of 12 inches between the Structure surface and the sides of the excavation.
 Keep the top of the trench within Right-of-Way or permit limits.
 (d) Trench Grade - Excavate trenches to the lines and grades shown or established, with proper
 allowance for pipe thickness, pipe bedding and foundation stabilization. Place pipe bedding on a
 firm, undisturbed, foundation, true to grade. If the trench is excavated below grade without
 authorization, restore to grade with material of the type specified for pipe bedding at no additional
 cost to the Agency. Place the material over the full width of the trench, in compacted layers not
 exceeding 6 inches.
 (e) Disposal of Excess Material - Place excavated material at locations and in such a manner
 that it does not create a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or interfere with the function of
 existing drainage facilities.
 
 305
 
 00405.42
 Make arrangements for and dispose of all excess material not required elsewhere on the Project
 in an approved manner, at no additional cost to the Agency, and according to 00330.41(a)(4).
 (f) Trench Protection - Provide the materials, labor and Equipment necessary to protect
 trenches at all times. Provide safe working conditions in the trench and protect the Work, existing
 property, utilities, Pavement, and the public. The method of protection shall be according to the
 Contractor's design. The Contractor may elect to use any combination of shoring, overbreak,
 tunneling, boring, sliding trench shields or other methods of accomplishing the Work, provided the
 method meets with the approval of the Engineer and complies with all applicable local, state, and
 federal safety codes.
 
 Be responsible for damages resulting from improper removal of shoring or from failure to shore.
 (g) Existing Abandoned Facilities - Remove and dispose of existing abandoned pipe,
 Structures and other facilities as necessary to construct the trench according to 00310.41(c).
 00405.42 Rock Excavation - Where Rock excavation as defined in this Section is required,
 remove the Rock to provide the minimum clearances shown on the Standard Drawings. Excavate
 and remove the overburden and expose the Rock to allow the Engineer to measure the Rock prior
 to removal.
 
 If using explosives, comply with the requirements of 00170.94. Prior to blasting, obtain the
 approval of the Engineer and the appropriate permits. Provide all tools and devices required for
 loading and using explosives, blasting caps and accessories. When blasting Rock in trenches,
 cover the area to be shot with blasting mats or other protective material to prevent the scattering of
 Rock fragments outside of the excavation.
 00405.43 Dewatering - Promptly remove and dispose of all water entering the trench during the
 time the trench is being prepared for the pipe laying, during the laying of the pipe and until the
 backfill at the pipe zone has been completed. Dispose of the water in an approved manner without
 damage to adjacent property.
 
 Control groundwater to prevent softening of the bottom of excavations or formation of "quick"
 conditions or "boils". Design and operate dewatering systems to prevent removal of the natural
 Soils and so that the groundwater level outside the excavation is not reduced to the extent that
 would damage or endanger adjacent Structures or property.
 When dewatering near a river, lake, or stream, conform to the requirements of 00290.30(a) and
 Section 00280. When the presence of water or other conditions in the excavated area would be
 detrimental to the purpose of the Work, obtain approval of the Engineer for the temporary measures
 required to correct or care for the condition.
 If water or other conditions encountered require permanent correction or care not anticipated by the
 Contract and not due to the Contractor's neglect or method of operation, perform the Work
 according to 00140.60.
 00405.44 Trench Foundation - Make the full length and width of completed trench bottoms firm.
 Do not place bedding material before the trench foundation is inspected and approved. If bell and
 spigot pipe is used, recess the trench bottom to accommodate the bell.
 
 When, in the judgment of the Engineer, the existing material in the bottom of the trench is unsuitable
 for supporting the pipe, excavate below grade, as directed. Replace the excavated material with
 imported trench foundation material conforming to 00405.11. Place the trench foundation material
 
 306
 
 00405.46
 in 6 inch layers and compact according to 00330.43 except compact selected stone backfill material
 in 12 inch layers. Bring the trench foundation material to the elevation established.
 00405.45 Pipe Bedding - Spread the bedding smoothly to the proper grade so that the pipe is
 uniformly supported along the barrel. Excavate bell holes at each joint to permit proper assembly
 and inspection of the joint. Bedding under the pipe shall provide a firm, unyielding support along the
 entire pipe length.
 00405.46 Backfilling - Backfill with material conforming to 00405.13 and the details shown, or as
 directed.
 (a) General - Begin backfilling when:
 
 • The foundation has been prepared, if required.
 • The bedding has been prepared.
 • The drainage facilities and fittings are installed.
 • The installation has been inspected and approved.
 Thoroughly tamp and compact all trench backfill with machine or pneumatic operated tampers of
 a size and type that will obtain the required density.
 Test for density according to 00330.43.
 Backfill either to the top of the trench, the surrounding ground level, or the upper limit of
 excavation, as directed. Dispose of excess excavated material not used in backfill Work
 according to Section 00330.
 (b) Pipe Zone - Place the materials in the pipe zone in layers not greater than 6 inches thick and
 in a manner that equalizes pressure on the Structure and minimizes stress. Before placing
 backfill material, condition, aerate, or wet the material so that the moisture content of each layer
 is within minus 4 percent to plus 2 percent of optimum moisture content.
 
 As required under the haunches of pipe and in areas not accessible to mechanical tampers or to
 testing, compact with hand methods to ensure intimate contact between the backfill material and
 the pipe or Structure. Provide thorough compaction.
 Ponding or jetting will not be allowed within the pipe zone.
 (c) Trench Backfill - The following requirements apply in the trench backfill area and in the pipe
 zone, except where in conflict with the requirements of 00405.46(b):
 (1) General - Use Class B trench backfill unless otherwise specified or approved.
 
 The Engineer may sample excavated material to determine the suitability of the Class A
 material for use as backfill. If the material is approved, the Contractor may elect to use the
 material in place of the specified backfill. Prevent excavated material from becoming saturated
 beyond the critical moisture limits, and replace any saturated Class A material with Class B, C,
 or D material, as specified, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (2) Class A, B, C, or D Backfill - Backfill the trench above the pipe zone in successive Lifts.
 Do not allow the backfill to free-fall into the trench until at least 3 feet of cover is provided over
 the top of the pipe. Modify the method of compaction as necessary to protect the pipe.
 
 307
 
 00405.46
 Compact the top 3 feet of trench backfill material within the Roadway and Shoulders, and
 within a 2V:1H Slope line projected from each Subgrade Shoulder, to not less than 95 percent
 of maximum density. Compact all other trench backfill material to not less than 90 percent of
 maximum density.
 Determine the maximum density by AASHTO T 99. If the specified compaction is not
 obtained, the Contractor may be required to use a modified compaction procedure or reduce
 the thickness of Lifts. If approved materials meeting the Specifications cannot be compacted
 to the required density regardless of compactive effort or method, the Engineer may reduce
 the required density or direct that alternate materials be used. Do not proceed with excavation
 and pipe laying operations until the backfill can be compacted to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer.
 If the material is not density testable, the Engineer will observe each layer for deflection or
 reaction under the compaction Equipment to verify that no soft or pumping areas remain.
 Compact until there is no perceptible deflection under the compaction Equipment.
 When the backfilling is complete, finish the surface area as specified. In paved or graveled
 areas, maintain the surface of the trench backfill level with the existing grade with 3/4" - 0
 crushed Aggregate material, or asphalt concrete if directed, until final Pavement replacement
 is complete and accepted.
 (3) Class E Backfill - Backfill the trench above the pipe zone with CLSM material. If the
 CLSM is to be used as a temporary Surfacing, backfill the CLSM to the top of the trench and
 strike it off to provide a smooth surface. If the CLSM is not to be used as a temporary
 Surfacing, backfill the CLSM up to the bottom of the proposed resurfacing. No compaction of
 CLSM is allowed. Use steel plates to protect the CLSM from traffic a minimum of 24 hours.
 After 24 hours, the CLSM may be paved, or opened to traffic until permanent surface
 restoration is completed, if it has hardened sufficiently to prevent rutting.
 (d) Ponding or Jetting of Backfill Materials - Ponding or jetting will not be allowed within
 Roadbed lateral limits. Ponding or jetting will be allowed outside Roadbeds when approved by the
 Engineer in writing.
 
 Use Class C or D trench backfill material at no additional cost to the Agency. Provide drainage at
 the bottom of the trench to remove water from the jetting operation. Compact to the density and
 deflection requirements of 00405.46(c).
 Furnish Equipment that provides a minimum gauge pressure of 35 psi at the discharge nozzle.
 Use a rigid pipe that will reach within 1 foot of the bottom of the backfill. Insert the pipe at
 intervals not exceeding 4 feet throughout the entire width and length of the trench backfill.
 (e) Temporary Trench Plating - When temporary steel plates are installed over a street cut,
 they shall be capable of carrying at least an MS-18 loading. Place steel plates with a minimum
 of 12 inches bearing on all sides of a cut. Anchor steel plates to minimize shifting. Shim the
 edges of all steel plates with cold mix asphalt.
 (f) Restoration of Streambeds - Comply with 00290.30(a) and Section 00280.
 completion of the Work:
 
 • Restore the streambed to its former condition of resistance to scour.
 • Remove all matter that has come into the stream due to the Contractor's activities.

 Upon
 
 00405.81
 00405.48 Surface Removal:
 (a) General - For trench resurfacing, see Section 00495.
 (b) Topsoil - Where trenches cross lawns, garden areas, pastures, cultivated fields or other
 areas on which Topsoil exists, remove the Topsoil to a minimum 12-inch depth and place the
 material in a stockpile. Do not mix the Topsoil with other excavated material. After the trench
 has been backfilled, replace the Topsoil.
 
 In lieu of stockpiling the Topsoil, approved imported Topsoil may be substituted, to a depth
 specified or approved, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Maintain the finished grade of the Topsoil level with the area adjacent to the trench until final
 acceptance by the Engineer, and repair damage to adjacent Topsoil caused by the Contractor's
 operations. Remove all Rock, gravel, Clay and other foreign materials from the surface.
 Regrade and add Topsoil as required.
 (c) Pavement, Curb, and Sidewalk - Use saws to cut portland cement concrete Pavement,
 curbs and sidewalks, regardless of thickness. In bituminous Pavement, when no Pavement
 overlay will occur, saw-cut the Pavement along each edge of the area to be removed. When
 Roadways will receive a Pavement overlay as part of the Project or following trench resurfacing,
 bituminous Pavement to be removed may be cut by wheel cutter, jack hammer, or other approved
 methods.
 
 Upon completion of backfill and just prior to Pavement resurfacing, saw the Surfacing on both
 sides of the trench a minimum of 6 inches wider than each top of the trench. In areas of any
 undermined or damaged Surfacing, re-saw to a width outside these areas. When saw-cutting,
 follow lines parallel to the pipe centerline.
 Where the width changes in areas of asphalt Pavement resurfacing, cut the transition between
 the different widths at 45 degrees. When the pipeline changes direction, or there is a connecting
 pipeline that requires the saw cut alignment to change at an angle greater than 60 degrees, make
 a minimum 24-inch transition saw cut. If there is damaged or undermined Surfacing at the
 transition point, make the transition saw cut beyond the damaged or undermined Surfacing.
 Make the transition saw cut angle half the angle change in the direction of the pipeline or
 connecting line.
 If the asphalt Surfacing is to be overlaid, the second saw cut will only be required to firm
 Subgrade.
 A second saw cut for concrete sidewalks, driveways and Pavements will not be required unless
 needed to reach firm Subgrade.
 Remove and dispose of Pavement lying within the limits of the cuts and from any adjoining areas
 damaged by the cutting and removal operations according to Section 00310.

 (b) Siphon, Irrigation and Sanitary Sewer Installations - After laying and joining pipe for
 siphons, irrigation and sanitary sewers, and backfilling trenches, test the installations for
 watertightness, including inlet and outlet connections, to the Engineer's satisfaction. Perform
 video, deflection, hydrostatic, and low-pressure air testing.
 00445.71 Requirements Prior to Tests:
 (a) General - All sanitary gravity systems, siphon systems and irrigation systems and
 appurtenances shall successfully pass a hydrostatic or air test prior to acceptance and shall be
 free of visible infiltration of water. Test manholes as specified in Section 00470.
 
 On pipe 30 inches in diameter and larger, individual joints may be tested by an approved joint
 testing device. All details of the testing procedure shall meet the approval of the Engineer.
 (b) Plugging Tees, Wyes, Stubs and Service Connections (Sanitary Only) - Plug all wyes,
 tees, stubs and service connections with gasketed caps or plugs securely fastened or blocked to
 withstand test pressures.
 (c) Testing Equipment - Furnish all necessary testing Equipment and perform the tests in a
 manner that provides observable and accurate measurements of either air or water leakage
 under the specified conditions. Calibrate and certify gauges at the direction of the Engineer.

 system and remove all debris.
 00445.72 Pipe Testing:
 (a) General - After completing installation of the system, including all service connections,
 backfilling and compaction, and prior to wearing surface paving, conduct a low-pressure air test
 or a hydrostatic test. Provide all Equipment and personnel for the test. Conduct tests during
 
 350
 
 00445.72
 normal working hours. The Engineer may require testing of manhole-to-manhole sections as they
 are completed in order to expedite the acceptance of the system and allow connections.
 The method, Equipment and personnel used in testing shall be subject to approval of the
 Engineer. The Engineer may, at any time, require a calibration check of the instrumentation
 used.
 (1) Safety Precautions - Only qualified personnel will be allowed to conduct the test. All
 plugs used to close the system for the testing shall be capable of resisting the expected
 internal pressures. Securely brace plugs, if necessary.
 (2) Groundwater - The presence of groundwater will affect the results of the test. Determine
 the average height of groundwater over the lines immediately before starting the test, using an
 approved method.
 (b) Hydrostatic Testing - Pipe and joints shall sustain losses not exceeding 0.04 gallons per
 hour per inch diameter per 100 feet of pipe when field-tested by exfiltration methods, except
 0.3 gallons per hour may be used in arid climate zones if approved by the Engineer.
 
 The hydrostatic head for test purposes shall exceed the maximum estimated groundwater level in
 the section being tested by at least 72 inches of water column and in no case shall be less than
 72 inches of water column above the inside top of the highest section of pipe in the test section,
 including service connections. The Engineer will make the final decisions regarding test height
 for the water in the pipe section being tested. The length of pipe tested by exfiltration shall be
 limited so that the pressure on the invert of the lower end of the section shall not exceed 28 feet
 of water column.
 The pipe test section may be filled 24 hours prior to time of exfiltration testing, if desired, to permit
 normal absorption into the pipe walls to take place.
 All service connection footage shall be taken into account in computing allowable leakage.
 (c) Air Testing - The pressure gauge used in air testing shall have minimum divisions of 0.1 psi
 and an accuracy of 0.0625 psi. All air testing shall be by the Time Pressure Drop Method. The
 test procedure is as follows:
 (1) The Contractor may wet the lines prior to testing.
 (2) Determine the average height of the groundwater over the line. The test pressures
 required shall be increased 0.433 psi for each foot of average water depth over the exterior
 crown of the pipe.
 (3) Add air slowly to the section of system being tested until the internal air pressure is raised
 to 4 psi greater than the average back-pressure due to groundwater.
 (4) After the test pressure is reached, allow at least 2 minutes for the air temperature to
 stabilize, adding only the amount of air required to maintain pressure.
 (5) After the temperature stabilization period, disconnect the air supply.
 (6) Record the time in seconds that is required for the internal air pressure to drop from 3.5 psi
 to 2.5 psi greater than the average backpressure due to groundwater.
 
 The tested section will be acceptable if the time recorded in paragraph (6) above is not less than
 the time in seconds (T) computed by the formula:
 351
 
 00445.73
 T = K/C
 Where:
 2
 
 K = the sum of the computations (0.011 d L) for each size of pipe and its length
 in the section
 C = the sum of the computations (0.0003882 dL) for each size of pipe and its
 length in the section, except that the minimum value for C shall be 1
 d = inside diameter of the pipe in inches
 L = length of pipe in feet
 (d) Individual Joint Testing:
 (1) General - The Contractor may test each individual joint for leakage using a pneumatic joint
 testing apparatus. The method, Equipment and personnel used in individual joint testing shall
 be as approved. The Engineer may, at any time, require a calibration check of the
 instrumentation used. The pressure gauge used shall have minimum divisions of 0.1 psi and
 have an accuracy of 0.0625 psi. All air used shall pass through a single control panel.
 (2) Method - All air testing shall be by the Time Pressure Drop Method. The test procedure is
 as follows:
 a. Determine the average height of the groundwater over the line. The test pressures
 required below shall be increased 0.433 psi for each foot of average water depth over the
 exterior crown of the pipe.
 b. Add air slowly to the section being tested until the internal air pressure is raised to 4 psi
 greater than the average backpressure due to groundwater.
 (3) Acceptance - The joint shall be considered acceptable if the pressure drops less
 than 1 psi within 5 seconds.
 00445.73 Deflection Testing for Flexible Pipe - Conduct deflection tests of sanitary and storm
 sewers constructed of flexible pipe prior to wearing surface paving. Conduct the testing by pulling
 an approved mandrel through the completed pipeline. Use a mandrel having at least 6 vanes and a
 diameter 95 percent of the pipe's initial inside diameter.
 
 Conduct testing on a manhole-to-manhole basis after the line has been completely flushed out with
 water. Conduct the tests not less than 30 days after the trench backfill and compaction have been
 completed. Tests may be conducted sooner if approved by the Engineer. The tests may be
 conducted concurrently with video inspection. If conducted concurrently, pull the mandrel in front of
 the camera so that the deflection testing is clearly recorded on the video tape unless approved by
 the Engineer. Provide a water depth gauge, located on the video camera side of the mandrel with
 the following characteristics:
 • Graduated with marks at 0.50-inch increments clearly visible during video inspection.
 • Capable of measuring water depth in 0.50-inch increments from 0.50 inch to 2.50 inches.
 • Designed so that it will remain plumb regardless of the rotation of the mandrel or video
 camera.
 00445.74 Video Inspection of Sanitary and Storm Sewers - For all existing culverts being
 extended, perform preconstruction video pipe inspection of the existing culvert according to
 Section 00415. For all existing sanitary sewer and storm sewers being altered or repaired, perform
 preconstruction video pipe inspection, according to Section 00415, between the nearest upstream
 manhole where Work is not being performed and the nearest downstream manhole where Work is
 not being performed, including all lateral runs between end manholes.
 
 352
 
 00445.80
 When constructing a new run, an extension, or a repair of sanitary sewer, storm sewer, or culvert
 pipe, perform post-construction video pipe inspection, according to Section 00415, of all joints,
 including the location where new pipe meets existing pipe. Conduct the post-construction video
 pipe inspection after backfill and compaction are complete, but before any finish Surfacing or final
 paving is performed.
 For pipe sections being replaced, video pipe inspection is not required prior to replacement. Video
 pipe inspection is not required for pipe sections that are being abandoned.
 00445.75 Repairs - Locate and repair any sections failing to pass the required tests and
 inspections. Repeat the specified tests and inspections on those sections at no additional cost to
 the Agency.
 
 Following a successful hydrostatic or air test, visible infiltration of groundwater in any section will be
 considered evidence that the original test was in error or that failure of the section has occurred.
 Correct such failures and retest the repaired sections, at no additional cost to the Agency.

 (c) Tell-Tales - Install and remove tell-tales according to Section 00445.
 (d) Arches And Horizontal Ellipses - In addition to the other provisions of this subsection,
 exercise care as follows:
 (1) Before Headwalls Are Placed - If backfilling pipes before headwalls are built, place the
 first backfill material midway between the ends, forming as narrow a ramp as possible until the
 top of the pipe is reached. Build the ramp evenly from both sides, and compact the backfill
 material as it is placed. After the ramps have been built to the top on each side of the pipe,
 deposit the remainder of the backfill evenly on both sides from the top of the pipe both ways
 from the center to the ends.
 (2) After Headwalls Are Placed - If headwalls are built before the pipe is backfilled, place the
 first backfill material adjacent to one headwall until the top of the pipe is reached. Then
 deposit backfill material evenly on both sides from the top of the pipe toward the other
 headwall.
 
 In multiple installations, follow the above procedures. Use care to place and bring the backfill up
 evenly on each side of each pipe to avoid unequal pressure.
 Compact the backfill material thoroughly, but not excessively. Using water to hydraulically
 consolidate the backfill by ponding or jetting the backfill material is not allowed.
 00450.47 Footings and Headwalls - Construct footings and headwalls for arches according to the
 design shown and the requirements of Sections 00440 and 00530.

 363
 
 00470.14
 00470.14 Pipe and Fittings - Furnish pipe and fittings as specified and conforming to the
 applicable portions of Section 00445. Use tees, ells and other fittings for drop manholes made from
 the same material as the pipe connecting to the manhole.
 00470.15 Pipe Stubouts for Future Sanitary Sewer Connections - Pipe stubouts shall be the
 same type and strength classification as approved for use in the lateral, main or trunk sewer
 construction. Where there are two different classes of pipe at a manhole, the higher strength pipe
 will govern strength classification. Furnish watertight plugs with each stubout and adequately brace
 against hydrostatic or air test pressures.
 00470.16 Sanitary Sewer Manhole Carry-Through - All sanitary sewer carry-through pipes and
 fittings through storm sewer manholes shall be ductile iron conforming to Section 02420.
 00470.17 Base Drain Backfill - Furnish Aggregate base or selected granular backfill material that

 Construction
 00470.40 General:
 (a) Excavation, Backfill and Foundation Stabilization - Excavate and backfill according to
 Section 00405. When specified, or as directed, remove unstable material that will not support the
 manhole or other Structure, excavate below grade and backfill with trench foundation stabilization
 material according to Section 00405.
 (b) Pipe Connections - Place connecting pipe at the required alignment and grade. Set the
 connecting pipe through the full thickness of the wall flush with the inner face of the wall. Ensure
 that pipe connections to the Structure are completely watertight. Connect all pipe to manholes
 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 Grout concrete pipe connections to manholes so they are watertight, using non-shrink grout
 conforming to 02440.50. When grouted into the manhole section, the pipe section shall not
 extend more than 18 inches outside the manhole. If an approved flexible connection for concrete
 pipe is provided at the manhole, full or partial pipe sections may be stubbed into the manhole as
 required.
 Connect flexible pipe to manholes using an adapter specifically manufactured for the intended
 service. Flexible pipe adapters are required to be watertight after installation. Follow the
 manufacturer's recommendations. Do not use field-fabricated water stops or improvised
 adapters. Adapters requiring the use of grout for installation shall be anchored and finished using
 non-shrink grout conforming to 02440.50.
 00470.41 Precast Concrete Manholes - Precast manhole components may be used to construct
 standard, drop and carry-through manholes.
 (a) Bases - If bases are cast in place, consolidate the concrete by mechanical vibration. Screed
 off the concrete so that the first manhole section to be placed has a level, uniform bearing for the
 full circumference.
 
 If bases are precast, carefully place the Base section on the prepared bedding so as to be fully
 and uniformly supported at true grade and alignment.
 Construct the invert to match that of the sewer pipe. Where the size of the sewer pipe is changed
 at the manhole, construct the invert to form a smooth transition without abrupt breaks or
 unevenness of the invert surfaces. Where a full section of concrete sewer pipe is laid through the
 364
 
 00470.43
 manhole, break out the top to the springline of the pipe for the full width of the manhole, and
 completely cover the exposed edge of the pipe with mortar. During construction divert existing
 flows of water or sewage away from new concrete or mortar surfaces to prevent damage to the
 fresh concrete or mortar until the initial set has been achieved.
 (b) Precast Manhole Sections - Thoroughly wet all lift holes, completely fill with non-shrink
 grout, and smooth and point both inside and out to ensure watertightness.
 (1) Sanitary Manholes - Use preformed plastic or rubber gaskets on all joints between
 manhole sections.
 (2) Storm Manholes - Non-shrink grout is allowed on joints, and on extension rings above the
 cone. In Roadways and other areas intended for traffic, a minimum of one 24-inch diameter
 precast riser is required between the cone and manhole cover frame.
 
 When grout is used do the following:
 • Clean and wet the surfaces to be joined with water.
 • Apply non-shrink grout to the lower portion of the bell or groove of the section already laid
 and to the upper portion of the spigot or tongue of the section being laid.
 • Clean the joint recesses, fill completely with non-shrink grout and wipe to a smooth finish
 both inside and out.
 • Do not allow free water to come in contact with grout joints within 24 hours after the
 mortared joints are finished.
 • Protect the completed joints against rapid drying.
 (c) Grates, Frames, Covers and Fittings - Set metal frames for manholes on full non-shrink
 grout beds to prevent infiltration of surface water or groundwater between the frame and the
 concrete of the manhole section. If concrete is to be poured around the frames, coat the portion
 of the frame that will contact the concrete with hot asphalt before placing the concrete. Set
 frames, covers and grates true to the locations and grades established. Clean bearing surfaces
 and provide uniform contact. Secure all fastenings. Construct all mortared, sanitary sewer
 manhole necks and all riser ring joints made with non-shrink grout using an approved commercial
 concrete bonding agent applied to all cured concrete surfaces being grouted.
 00470.42 Precast Concrete Catch Basins and Inlets - Install precast catch basins and inlets to
 the specified line and grade.
 00470.43 Cast-in-Place Concrete Construction:
 (a) General - Construct cast-in-place manholes, inlets, siphon boxes and concrete slope
 protectors according to Section 00440. Finish all inside surfaces smooth and free of depressions
 or protrusions. Form exterior surfaces with steel, plywood or other approved materials. Form
 other surfaces with matched boards, plywood, or other approved material. Do not cast directly
 against trench walls, Rock, or earth.
 (b) Cast-in-Place Catch Basins and Inlets - Construct forms for both the inside and outside
 walls of cast-in-place catch basins. Forms shall be tight and well braced, with chamfered corners.
 Remove all water and debris prior to placing concrete.
 
 Consolidate the concrete immediately after placement with an approved vibrator. Limit vibration
 time to that necessary to produce satisfactory consolidation without causing segregation. Screed
 the top surface and trowel exposed surfaces to a smooth finish, free from marks or irregularities.
 
 365
 
 00470.45
 Radius exposed edges with a steel edging tool. After forms are removed, patch any defects in
 the concrete with an approved mortar mix.
 Immediately after removal of forms and final finishing, cure according to 00440.40(e).
 00470.45 Steps and Ladders - Fasten steps and ladders to the manhole walls according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations and as shown.
 00470.46 Corrugated Pipe Slope Protectors - Construct corrugated metal slope protectors
 according to the Plans and the applicable requirements of Section 00445.
 00470.47 Concrete Inlet Base Drains - Provide concrete inlets with base drains leading from
 abutting Aggregate base or selected granular backfill material.
 
 Use nonreinforced concrete pipe, concrete drain tile, polyethylene pipe or polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
 plastic pipe for basin drains. Place and compact backfill without damaging pipe or inlet.
 Finishing, Cleaning up, and Testing
 00470.70 Cleaning - Upon completion, clean each Structure of accumulated silt, debris or foreign
 matter of any kind and keep clean until final acceptance of the Work.
 00470.71 Sanitary Manhole Acceptance Testing - Field-test all sanitary sewer manholes for
 acceptance by either hydrostatic or vacuum testing after completion of backfilling, compaction and
 surface restoration, including paving. If the manhole fails the test, make necessary repairs by an
 approved method, and retest the manhole. Repair and retest the manhole until a satisfactory test is
 obtained.
 (a) Hydrostatic Testing - Perform hydrostatic testing according to ASTM C497. Plug all inlets
 and outlets and fill the manhole with water. Fill each manhole to the rim at the start of the test.
 Leakage in each manhole shall not exceed 0.3 gallons per hour per foot of head above the invert.
 Determine leakage by refilling to the rim using a calibrated container. Manholes may be filled
 24 hours prior to the time of testing to permit normal absorption into the manhole walls.
 (b) Vacuum Testing - Perform vacuum testing according to ASTM C1244. Plug and brace all
 pipes entering the manhole. Place the test head in or on top of the manhole ring. Draw a
 vacuum of 10 inches of mercury on the manhole, close the valve on the vacuum line of the test
 head, and shut off the vacuum pump. Measure the time for the vacuum to drop to 9 inches of
 mercury. The manhole is acceptable if the time for the vacuum reading to drop from 10 inches of
 mercury to 9 inches of mercury meets or exceeds the values indicated in the following table:

 00512.41 Drilled Shaft Coordination Meeting - Hold a drilled shaft coordination meeting at
 least 7 Calendar Days before beginning any shaft construction Work at the site to discuss
 construction procedures, schedules, staging, personnel, Equipment to be used, and other elements
 of the approved shaft installation plan as specified in 00512.40. If synthetic slurry is used to
 construct the shafts, the frequency of scheduled site visits to the Project Site by the synthetic slurry
 manufacturer's representative will be discussed. Those attending the meeting include:
 
 • Representing the Contractor - The superintendent, on-site supervisors, and all supervisors in
 charge of excavating the shaft, placing the casing, mixing and installing slurry (as applicable),
 placing the steel reinforcing bars, and placing the concrete. If synthetic slurry is used to
 construct the shafts, the slurry manufacturer's representative and a Contractor's employee
 trained in the use of the synthetic slurry shall also attend.
 • Representing the Contracting Agency - The Project Engineer, key inspection personnel,
 and designers of record or their appointed representatives.
 If the Contractor's key personnel change, or if the Contractor proposes a significant revision of the
 approved shaft installation plan, hold an additional meeting before any additional shaft construction
 operations are performed.
 00512.42 Construction Tolerances - Excavate drilled shafts as accurately as possible at the
 locations shown and within the specified tolerances listed below. Determine the drilled shaft
 dimensions and alignment with approved methods. The following construction tolerances apply to
 drilled shafts unless otherwise stated:
 
 397
 
 00512.43
 • Horizontal Position (at the Plan Elevation of the Top of Shaft):
 • Shaft Diameter Less Than or Equal to 6 Feet - 3 inch horizontal tolerance from the
 location shown.
 • Shaft Diameter Greater Than 6 Feet - 6 inch horizontal tolerance from the location shown.
 • Top Elevation of Shaft Concrete:
 • Top Elevation above Water - Minus 3 inches to plus 1 inch from the plan top of shaft
 elevation.
 • Top Elevation under Water - Minus 3 inches to plus 6 inches from the plan top of shaft
 elevation.
 • Vertical Alignment in Soil - May not vary from the plan alignment by more than 1.5 percent of
 the shaft length.
 • Vertical Alignment in Rock - May not vary from the plan alignment by more than 2 percent of
 the shaft length.
 • Top of Steel Reinforcement - Plus or minus 6 inches from the plan top of steel reinforcement
 elevation.
 Frequently check the plumbness, alignment, and dimensions of the shaft during construction.
 Correct all out-of-tolerance shaft excavations and completed shafts to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. Materials and Work necessary to complete corrections for out-of-tolerance drilled shafts
 will be at the Contractor's expense, and no extension of the Project completion date will be granted.
 Materials and Work necessary to complete corrections for out-of-tolerance drilled shafts resulting
 from the removal of unexpected drilled shaft obstructions will be paid for according to 00195.20.
 00512.43 Drilled Shaft Excavation - Perform drilled shaft excavation according to the following:
 (a) General - Excavate drilled shafts to the dimensions and elevations shown or as directed.
 Provide and maintain stabilized drilled shaft sidewalls and bottoms for the full depth of the
 excavation, using approved Materials, Equipment and methods. If caving or other unstable
 conditions occur during any construction procedure, stop further construction, notify the Engineer,
 and stabilize the shaft excavation by approved methods and submit a revised installation plan
 which addresses the problem and prevents further instability. Do not continue with shaft
 construction until any damage which occurred has been repaired according to the Specifications
 and until receiving the Engineer's approval of the revised shaft installation plan.
 
 If the Engineer has reason to believe that the drilled shaft excavation techniques or workmanship
 have been deficient, so that the integrity of any excavation is in question, Work on that drilled
 shaft may be stopped. Drilled shaft excavation will not be allowed to resume until the deficient
 excavation techniques or workmanship have been changed to the Engineer's satisfaction.
 Dispose of materials removed from the shaft excavations according to 00290.20.
 Do not leave partially completed shaft excavations open overnight unless they are cased full
 depth or otherwise stabilized with approved methods. If approved by the Engineer, a partially
 excavated shaft may be left open overnight, provided that the excavation is:
 • Stabilized at the bottom, sides and surface to prevent Soil caving or swelling or a reduction
 of Soil strength.
 • Covered at the surface to protect the public.
 398
 
 00512.43
 Extend the drilled shaft excavation if the Engineer determines that the subsurface materials
 encountered are not capable of providing the required bearing resistance or differ from those
 anticipated in the design of the drilled shafts.
 (b) Protection of Existing Structures - Control shaft construction operations to prevent
 damage to existing Structures and utilities. Preventive measures include, but are not limited to,
 selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent caving of the shaft excavation
 and monitoring and controlling the vibrations from construction activities such as the driving and
 vibrating of casing or sheeting, drilling of the shaft, or from blasting, if blasting is allowed. Repair
 all damage caused to existing Structures, utilities or other facilities, resulting from drilled shaft
 construction activities, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (c) Temporary Casing - Provide temporary casing according to the approved installation plan
 and of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the anticipated construction method.
 
 Where the peak horizontal ground acceleration coefficient for the 1,000-year return period used
 for seismic design of the Structure is less than or equal to 0.16 g (acceleration due to gravity),
 temporary telescoping casing may be used for the drilled shafts, subject to the following
 conditions:
 • Submit the request to use temporary telescoping casing to the Engineer for approval.
 Specify the diameters and lengths of the temporary telescoping casing and the shafts where
 use is requested.
 • The minimum diameter of the shaft shall be as shown on the Plans.
 • Backfill all voids between the temporary telescoping casing and the plan shaft dimensions
 with a material that approximates the geotechnical properties of the subsurface Soils, or
 with concrete as approved.
 • Use temporary telescoping casing material conforming to 00512.13.
 (d) Unexpected Drilled Shaft Obstructions - Remove any natural or manmade object
 encountered that was not revealed by the Agency's site investigation, and that would cause a
 significant decrease in the rate of advancement if removed using the techniques and Equipment
 used successfully to excavate the shaft. The Engineer will be the sole judge of the significance of
 any reduced rate of shaft advancement and the classification of any unexpected obstructions.
 Removal of unexpected obstructions from the shaft excavation will be paid according
 to 00195.20.
 (e) Lost Tools - Promptly remove drilling tools lost in the excavation. Lost tools will not be
 considered unexpected obstructions and shall be removed without additional compensation.
 Drilling tools lost during the course of removing unexpected drilled shaft obstructions will be paid
 according to 00195.20.
 (f) Drilling Slurry Installation - If synthetic drilling slurry is selected, provide a manufacturer's
 representative to provide technical assistance at the site prior to use of the slurry, who shall
 remain at the site during construction and completion of a minimum of one drilled shaft to adjust
 the slurry mix for the specific site subsurface conditions. After the manufacturer's representative
 is no longer at the site, provide the approved personnel trained in the use of the synthetic slurry
 for the remainder of the shaft slurry operations to supervise the proper slurry mix design and
 quality control procedures.
 
 All in-hole drilling slurry shall meet the required slurry specifications during excavation and prior to
 concrete placement. Clean, recirculate, de-sand or replace the slurry to maintain the required
 slurry properties.
 399
 
 00512.45
 Unless otherwise approved, maintain the level of slurry in the excavation at not less than 5 feet
 above the groundwater level for mineral slurries or 10 feet above the groundwater level for
 synthetic or water slurries. Maintain the slurry level a sufficient distance above all unstable zones
 to prevent bottom heave, caving or sloughing.
 Maintain the required slurry properties and levels at all times during shaft construction, including
 Work stoppages, unless other approved stabilization methods are applied.
 Feed slurry continuously into the shaft excavation as drilling progresses so that a stable
 excavation is maintained. Use a self-priming pump to reclaim the slurry. Keep a standby pump
 available during the drilling operation.
 (g) Drilling Slurry Inspection and Testing - Mix and thoroughly hydrate all drilling slurries in an
 appropriate storage facility. Collect sample sets from the storage facility and perform tests to
 ensure the slurry conforms to the specified material properties before introduction into the drilled
 shaft excavation. A sample set shall be composed of samples taken at mid-depth and within
 24 inches of the bottom of the storage facility.
 
 Sample and test all slurry in the presence of the Engineer, unless otherwise directed. The
 sample sets of slurry within the excavation shall consist of samples taken at mid-depth of the
 excavation and within 24 inches of the bottom of the excavation. Collect and test sample sets
 during the drilling operation as necessary to ensure the specified properties of the slurry are
 maintained. Clean, recirculate, de-sand, or replace the slurry as necessary to maintain the
 specified slurry properties. Final cleaning of the excavation and placement of concrete will not be
 allowed until the test results indicate the slurry properties are as specified.
 Perform a minimum of two sets of slurry tests per 8 hour work shift, the first test being done at the
 beginning of the shift. Field conditions may require more frequent testing to ensure acceptable
 slurry properties.
 Make copies of all slurry test results available to the Engineer on request.
 (h) Clean Out - Use appropriate means, such as a cleanout bucket, pump or air lift, to clean the
 bottom of the drilled shaft excavations. No more than 2 inches of loose or disturbed material will
 be allowed at the bottom of the excavation for end-bearing drilled shafts. No more than 6 inches
 of loose or disturbed material will be allowed at the bottom of the excavation for side friction
 drilled shafts. Assume end-bearing shafts unless otherwise shown or specified. Shaft
 cleanliness will be determined by the Engineer.
 
 Notify the Engineer of completion of each drilled shaft excavation to permit inspection before
 proceeding with construction. Measure final shaft depths with a suitable weighted tape or other
 approved method after final cleaning to determine that the shaft bottom meets the requirements
 in the Contract. Do not proceed with shaft construction until the bottom cleanliness requirements
 have been met and the bottom (shaft tip) elevation is approved.
 00512.45 Reinforcing Steel - Furnish and place reinforcing steel as shown and according to the
 following:
 (a) Placement - Do not place reinforcing steel in the shaft excavation until the Engineer has
 approved the final elevation of the bottom of the shaft.
 
 In each shaft, place reinforcing steel extending from 6 inches above the bottom of the shaft
 excavation to the elevation shown. The reinforcing cage may be supported on the bottom of the
 shaft excavation if approved. Support the reinforcing cage to prevent distortion or settlement
 400
 
 00512.47
 during concrete placement. If concrete placement does not immediately follow cage placement,
 remove the reinforcing cage from the excavation and rectify the integrity of the excavation prior to
 reinstallation of the cage.
 (b) Bracing - Rigidly brace the reinforcing cage to retain its shape for lifting. Lift the cage in a
 manner that does not cause permanent racking or distortion. Show bracing and any extra
 reinforcing steel required for fabrication of the cage on the submitted shop drawings. Remove
 cross bracing during cage placement unless otherwise approved.
 (c) Splicing - Splice all drilled shaft reinforcement using approved mechanical splicer's unless
 otherwise shown or approved.
 (d) Concrete Cover - Maintain the required concrete cover shown by placing concentric spacer
 bars or other approved devices around the reinforcing cage. Place spacing devices on maximum
 10 foot vertical spacing the full length of the shaft. At each 10 foot level, place spacers on a
 maximum 30 inch circumferential spacing with at least three spaces per level. Do not use wood
 spacers or concrete dobies. Provide details of the proposed centering method on the shop
 drawings submitted according to 00512.40.
 00512.46 Crosshole Sonic Log Test Access Tubes - Furnish and install access tubes for CSL
 testing as shown. Attach CSL access tubes securely to the interior of the reinforcement cage as
 near to parallel as possible in each drilled shaft and in the pattern shown. Extend the access tubes
 from the bottom of the reinforcement cage to at least 24 inches above the top of the shaft. Joints
 required to achieve full-length access tubes shall be watertight. Do not damage the access tubes
 during reinforcement cage installation and concrete placement. Fill the tubes with potable water,
 according to 02020.10(b), as soon as possible, but no more than 1 hour after concrete placement
 and reinstall the top watertight caps. Check water level and top off as needed.
 
 Replace all access tubes that the test probe cannot pass through to the full depth of the shaft at no
 additional cost to the Agency. Replace all damaged access tubes with 1.5 inch to 2.0 inch diameter
 holes cored through the concrete for the entire length of the shaft. Unless otherwise directed, locate
 replacement core holes approximately 6 inches inside the reinforcement. Do not damage the shaft
 reinforcement during coring operations.
 Fill the access tubes with grout only after all CSL testing has been completed and the shaft has
 been accepted.
 00512.47 Concrete - Furnish and place concrete according to the following:
 (a) Concrete Placement - Place concrete immediately after completion of the shaft excavation
 and with the approval of the Engineer. Prior to concrete placement, ensure the shaft clean-out
 requirements are met according to 00512.43(h) and the properties of the slurry (if used) conform
 to the Specifications. Shaft concrete may be placed without mechanical vibration in those areas
 of the drilled shaft that are not formed or are below the ground line or the water surface.
 
 Place concrete continuously until concrete at the top of the shaft or at the top of the first
 construction joint, is free of water, Soil, and debris, and uncontaminated concrete extends to the
 plan top-of-shaft elevation or to the top of the construction joint, as applicable. For shafts with a
 non-contact splice, clean and roughen the surface of the shaft construction joint according to the
 applicable portions of 00540.43(a). Dispose of all contaminated concrete expelled from the top
 of the shaft in an approved manner. Remove waste concrete from the site. If a delay in concrete
 placement occurs because of a delay in concrete delivery or other factors, reduce the placement
 rate to maintain a flow of fresh concrete into the shaft excavation.
 
 401
 
 00512.47
 Unless otherwise approved by mix design, allow a maximum of 60 minutes between concrete
 placements and use no concrete older than 90 minutes from batch time. Use procedures for
 concrete placement which ensure that the concrete within the shaft becomes a monolithic,
 homogeneous unit.
 Place concrete using hoses or pipes having watertight joints. For concrete placement by gravity
 tremie, use hose or pipe having an inside diameter of at least 8 inches. For placement by
 concrete pump, use hose with inside diameter of at least 4 inches. Provide an alternate delivery
 system that can be used in case of failure of the primary delivery system. Place concrete only
 against the bottom of the drilled shaft or into fresh concrete.
 If caving occurs during concrete placement, the shaft may be rejected.
 (b) Dry Shaft Concrete Placement - Concrete may be placed by free-fall if all of the following
 conditions are met:
 
 • No more than 3 inches of water is present in the bottom of the excavation at the beginning
 of the pour.
 • Groundwater seepage into the excavation is at a rate of no more than 12 inches per hour.
 • Shaft diameter is greater than or equal to 3 feet.
 Under free-fall placement, deposit concrete through the center of the reinforcement cage by a
 method which prevents segregation of Aggregates and splashing of concrete on the
 reinforcement cage. Place concrete so that the free-fall is vertical down the center of the shaft
 without hitting the sides, the steel reinforcing bars or steel cage bracing.
 (c) Wet Shaft Concrete Placement - If the drilled shaft excavation does not meet the
 requirements for dry concrete placement, stabilize water inflow and place the concrete under
 water or slurry with a tremie pipe or pump hose according to 00540.48(e). Place concrete
 continuously from the bottom of the shaft to the top-of-shaft elevation shown. Use a plug in the
 tremie pipe or pump hose to force water or slurry ahead of the advancing flow of fresh concrete.
 Dispose of all displaced water, slurry, or waste concrete according to 00290.20. When
 groundwater, the drilling water or slurry in the shaft excavation is to be removed by pumping
 during concrete placement, have a standby pump available.
 
 Place concrete in a continuous operation so that the concrete always flows upward within the
 shaft. Withdraw the delivery hose or pipe slowly as the elevation of the fresh concrete rises in the
 shaft. Keep the discharge end of the pipe or hose at least 5 feet below the surface of the
 concrete after the concrete has reached a depth of 5 feet. Maintain sufficient concrete inside the
 hose or pipe to prevent drilling fluid from entering. During concrete placement, provide and
 maintain markings on the tremie pipe or pump hose, or a sounding device or other appropriate
 method to determine the relative elevations of the fresh concrete surface and the bottom end of
 the pipe or hose. Raise the bottom end of the pipe or hose only when the pipe or hose has a
 sufficient head of fresh concrete to prevent the formation of a void at the bottom.
 (d) Concrete Curing and Cleaning - Allow the exposed top of concrete to cure a minimum
 of 7 Calendar Days by covering with wet burlap overlain with plastic sheets or by keeping top of
 concrete under water. Keep the burlap wet during the concrete cure.
 
 Prior to placing any fresh concrete on top of a completed shaft, clean the upper surface of the
 concrete by removing all scum, laitance, loose gravel, and sediment and chip off any high spots
 on the upper surface that would prevent the steel reinforcing bar cage from being properly placed
 in the position shown on the Plans. Remove all loose material and poor quality concrete at the
 top of the shaft down to sound concrete prior to performing any required CSL testing.
 402
 
 00512.48
 (e) Casing Removal - Remove all temporary casing during or after completion of concrete
 placement. Do not start temporary casing removal until the level of fresh concrete within the
 casing has reached a depth of at least 10 feet or the level necessary to adequately counteract the
 external hydrostatic pressure head. As the temporary casing is withdrawn, maintain a minimum
 5 feet head of concrete above the bottom of the casing. A slight downward movement of the
 casing while exerting downward pressure, or hammering or vibrating the casing will be allowed to
 facilitate extraction. Extract the casing so that concrete is cast directly against the surrounding
 in-situ material. Check the elevation of the top of the reinforcing cage before and after temporary
 casing extraction for conformance with the construction tolerance criteria of 00512.42. Casing
 that cannot be extracted during, or immediately after, the concrete placement operation may be
 cause for rejection of the shaft.
 
 Remove the tops of permanent casing to the top of the drilled shaft or the finished groundline,
 whichever is lower, unless otherwise shown or directed. Remove the tops of permanent casing
 for shafts constructed in a permanent body of water to the low water elevation, unless otherwise
 shown or directed.
 00512.48 Drilled Shaft Testing and Acceptance - Acceptance of drilled shafts will be based on
 the Engineer's review of the results of CSL, or other, integrity testing (if conducted), field inspection
 reports and visual observations during drilled shaft construction. The Engineer has final authority on
 the approval of drilled shafts. For shafts that are integrity tested, the Engineer will determine final
 acceptance of each tested shaft, based on the integrity test results and inspection reports and will
 provide a response to the Contractor within 5 Calendar Days after receiving the CSL test report.
 (a) Crosshole Sonic Log Testing - Provide crosshole sonic log testing Equipment and perform
 crosshole sonic log testing and analysis on the first drilled shaft completed at each Structure and
 subsequent shafts as specified or designated for testing by the Engineer. Provide CSL testing
 Equipment conforming to the requirements of ASTM D6760 and approved by the Engineer.
 Provide all necessary access and other support to the CSL testing firm necessary to do the CSL
 testing Work.
 
 Perform one CSL test on each shaft designated for testing. A single CSL test consists of all
 ultrasonic profile combinations in a given shaft. Test completed drilled shaft foundations using
 Ultrasonic Crosshole Testing methods (Crosshole Sonic Log (CSL) Testing) according to
 ASTM D6760. Inform the Engineer of scheduled CSL testing at least 3 Calendar Days prior to
 the testing. Perform all CSL testing using the Contractor's CSL technician in the presence of the
 Engineer.
 Allow at least 3 Calendar Days of curing time before testing unless otherwise approved.
 Additional curing time beyond 3 Calendar Days may be required if the shaft concrete contains
 admixtures such as set retarding admixture or water reducing admixture. Additional CSL testing
 required due to the CSL testing being conducted on concrete that has not cured sufficiently is at
 no additional cost to the Agency. Additional curing time required due to concrete admixtures will
 not be grounds for additional compensation or time extensions.
 For drilled shafts constructed using non-contact splice methods, perform CSL testing after the
 initial pour to the bottom of the splice region and before placement of the column reinforcement
 and pouring of the splice region.
 (b) Contractor's Crosshole Sonic Log Test Reports - Provide a brief summary report of the
 data, with interpretation of the test results, to the Engineer at the completion of each test. Provide
 copies (either hardcopies or electronic files) of the raw test data as requested. Mark the test data
 files to identify, as a minimum, the Structure, bent and shaft number, the date of CSL testing,
 depths of testing and any other pertinent information.
 
 403
 
 00512.49
 Submit three copies of a final CSL Test Report for each shaft tested according to ASTM D6760.
 Provide electronic file copies of the raw CSL data measurements, if requested. The report shall
 summarize the CSL testing performed, data analysis, and interpretation of CSL data with special
 attention made to the identification and location of any anomalies or possible defects. Provide
 interpretation of the CSL test data in terms of overall shaft integrity and acceptance. Submit all
 reports to the Engineer within 5 Calendar Days of the performance of the tests.
 (c) Additional Testing and Investigation - Conduct additional testing or investigation
 necessary to identify the location, extent and condition of possible shaft defects if requested by
 the Engineer. Additional testing and investigation may include, but is not limited to, additional
 CSL testing, excavation Work or core drilling.
 If requested by the Engineer, drill a core hole in any questionable quality shaft to explore the shaft
 condition. The number, location and depths of the core holes will be determined by the Engineer.
 Submit the method and Equipment used to drill and remove cores from the shaft to the Engineer
 for review and approval prior to drilling. Use a coring method that provides complete core
 recovery and minimizes abrasion and erosion of the core. If a defect is confirmed, as determined
 by the Engineer, all investigation costs associated with identifying the defect will be at no
 additional cost to the Agency and no extension of the Project completion date will be granted,
 regardless of whether the identified defect is repaired or not.
 If no defect is identified in the investigation Work, and the CSL tubes were satisfactorily installed
 according to ASTM D6760 and accepted, the Agency will pay for all coring and excavation costs
 associated with the additional investigation and grant an appropriate time extension, if required,
 according to Section 00190 and Section 00195. If it is determined by the Engineer that the CSL
 tubes were not installed properly thus invalidating the CSL test results, all coring, excavation, and
 other investigation and evaluation costs will be at no additional cost to the Agency and no
 extension of the Project completion date will be granted.
 Fill all core holes with grout only after the evaluation process is completed and the shaft is
 accepted and approved.
 (d) Drilled Shaft Repair - Repair all defects and rejected shafts according to 00512.40(b).
 Perform additional CSL testing, or other investigation required, as directed by the Engineer, to
 confirm the quality of the completed shaft repair Work at no additional cost to the Agency with no
 time extension granted.
 For temporary casing not extracted from the shaft excavation, submit a repair plan or a structural
 evaluation to the Engineer for approval according to 00512.40. If caving occurs during concrete
 placement submit a repair plan to the Engineer for approval.
 00512.49 Scheduling and Restrictions - Unless otherwise approved, do not proceed with
 construction of subsequent shafts until the CSL testing has been completed on the first drilled shaft
 and the results have been approved and accepted, in writing by the Engineer. Approval to proceed
 with the construction of subsequent shafts, before receiving approval of the first shaft will be based
 on the Engineer's observations of the Contractor's workmanship during construction of the first shaft
 and the Engineer's review and assessment of the following:
 
 • The Contractor's conformance with the approved shaft installation plan.
 • The Contractor's daily reports and Inspector's daily logs of excavation, rebar, and concrete
 placement.
 • The concrete placement logs and volume curves.
 
 404
 
 00512.90
 Written notification will be provided to the Contractor on whether or not to proceed with subsequent
 shaft construction within 24 hours after completion of the first shaft. If the Engineer determines the
 first shaft to be of questionable quality, discontinue all shaft construction until the CSL test results of
 the first shaft are received and reviewed and the shaft accepted, in writing, by the Engineer.
 Denial of permission to proceed with subsequent shaft construction will not be cause for Contract
 Time extension.
 Do not proceed with the third drilled shaft until the final CSL test results from the first drilled shaft
 has been received and reviewed and the shaft accepted, in writing, by the Engineer. Allow
 5 Calendar Days for the Engineer to review.
 After the first drilled shaft on the Project has been accepted, make no significant changes in
 construction methods, Equipment, or Materials used to construct subsequent shafts, unless
 otherwise approved.

 • The Agency will purchase from the Contractor piles that are stockpiled at a location on the
 Project selected by the Engineer according to 00195.80.
 Equipment
 00520.20 Equipment for Driving Piles - Provide pile driving Equipment meeting the following
 requirements:
 (a) Impact Pile Hammers - Provide a striking part of the hammer not less than one-third the
 weight of the helmet and pile being driven, but never less than 2,750 pounds.
 (1) Air-Steam Hammers - Provide power plant and Equipment for air-steam hammers with
 sufficient capacity under working conditions to maintain the volume and pressure at the
 
 407
 
 00520.20
 hammer specified by the manufacturer and with accurate pressure gauges easily accessible to
 the Engineer.
 (2) Open-End Diesel Hammers - Provide open-end (single-acting) diesel hammers equipped
 with a device which allows the Engineer to visually determine hammer stroke at all times
 during pile driving operations. Provide the Engineer with the hammer manufacturer's chart
 equating stroke and blows per minute.
 (3) Closed-End Diesel Hammers - Provide closed-end (double-acting) diesel hammers
 equipped with a bounce chamber pressure gauge, mounted near ground level so the Engineer
 can easily read it. Before driving, provide the Engineer a chart calibrated within 6 months
 before first use on the Project to actual hammer performance, equating bounce chamber
 pressure to either equivalent energy or stroke.
 (4) Gravity Hammers - Provide gravity hammers that have a ram weighing between
 2,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds and a drop height of not more than 10 feet. The weight of
 gravity hammers shall not be less than the combined weight of helmet and pile.
 (5) Hydraulic Hammers - Provide either single or double acting hydraulic hammers equipped
 with monitoring systems to measure impact velocity and determine equivalent energy and
 stroke. Locate monitoring systems for easy access by the Engineer.
 (b) Vibratory Hammers - Control installation of production piles with vibratory hammers
 according to the power consumption, rate of penetration, specified tip elevation, or other
 acceptable means which assure the pile resistance equals or exceeds the required nominal pile
 bearing resistance. After driving piles with a vibratory hammer, verify pile resistance
 (see 00520.42) by driving them with an impact hammer of suitable energy. Do not use vibratory
 hammers to drive test piles or when preboring or jetting.
 (c) Driving Components:
 (1) Pile Cushion - Protect the heads of prestressed concrete piles with a pile cushion made of
 wood or other approved material.
 
 The pile cushion shall be:
 • Equal to or greater in cross-sectional contact area than the pile head.
 • In full contact with the pile head.
 • No less than 4 inches thick, before driving begins, if made of plywood.
 Provide a pile cushion for each pile. Replace the pile cushion if, during the driving, the cushion
 is either compressed to less than one-half the original thickness or begins to burn.
 (2) Helmet - Equip piles driven with impact hammers with an adequate metal helmet. The
 helmet shall:
 
 • Fit around the pile top.
 • Be axially aligned with the hammer and pile.
 • Distribute the hammer energy to the total Cross Section of the pile head.
 • Be guided by leads.
 (3) Hammer Cushion - Equip impact pile driving Equipment with a suitable thickness of
 hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer or pile and to ensure uniform
 
 408
 
 00520.20
 driving performance. Provide hammer cushions of durable manufactured materials according
 to the hammer manufacturer's guidelines. Do not use wood, wire rope, or asbestos hammer
 cushions.
 Place a striker plate, as recommended by the hammer manufacturer, on the hammer cushion
 to ensure uniform compression of the cushion material.
 Inspect the hammer cushion in the presence of the Engineer at the beginning of pile driving at
 each Structure or after each 100 hours of use during pile driving, whichever is less. Replace
 the hammer cushion when its thickness becomes less than 75 percent of its original thickness.
 (4) Followers - Use a follower between the pile hammer and the pile to transmit energy when
 the pile head is below the reach of the hammer, if allowed by the Special Provisions or
 approved in writing. If a follower is allowed, drive the first pile in each bent, and every tenth
 pile driven after that, full length without a follower. Before additional piles are installed, verify
 that the first two piles installed with followers in each Substructure unit meet the position and
 alignment criteria of 00520.41(f).
 (5) Leads - Support piles in line and position while driving. Construct pile hammer leads to
 give the hammer freedom of movement while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the
 pile to ensure concentric impact for each blow. Leads shall be fixed unless the Engineer
 approves the use of swinging leads. Fit swinging leads, when used, with a pile gate at the
 bottom of the leads. To maintain alignment of batter piles, use horizontally braced swinging
 leads, adequately embedded in the ground, or rigidly attached to prevent movement during pile
 driving.
 (d) Approval of Pile-Driving Equipment:
 (1) General - Before beginning test pile or production pile driving, obtain approval in writing of
 pile driving Equipment.
 
 To obtain approval, complete and submit the Agency's "Pile and Driving Equipment Data" form
 at least 14 Calendar Days before pile driving begins. This form is available from the Engineer.
 Within 14 Calendar Days of receiving the form, the Engineer will notify the Contractor of
 approval or rejection of the pile-driving Equipment.
 During pile-driving operations, no changes to the approved Equipment will be allowed without
 the Engineer's written permission. Submit a request for change on a "Pile and Driving
 Equipment Data" form. The Engineer will give notification of approval or rejection within
 7 Calendar Days of receiving the form. Time required for resubmission and review of a
 Contractor's Equipment change request is not a basis for a Contract Time extension request
 unless the Engineer does not respond in 7 Calendar Days.
 (2) Standard Evaluation Method - The standard method of evaluating driving Equipment
 requires that the field-measured hammer energy be within the range of energy levels given in
 Table 00520-1 corresponding to the nominal pile bearing resistance shown.

 Wave Equation required
 
 Requirements are based on the FHWA Gates equation (see 00520.42(b)), except all
 driving criteria for double acting and differential hammers both air/steam and diesel
 will be by the wave equation analysis.
 
 If during the pile-driving operation, the Engineer determines the hammer is not operating
 properly and is unable to drive the piles to the required resistance, do not use the hammer until
 repaired to the Engineer's satisfaction.
 The required number of hammer blows indicated by the FHWA Gates equation at the nominal
 pile bearing resistance shall be at a rate between 2 and 10 blows per inch.
 (3) Wave Equation Method - Select a suitable hammer for driving piles and perform wave
 equation analyses. Use the 1987 or newer version of the Wave Equation Analysis Program
 (WEAP). Conduct the wave equation analyses using personnel qualified by training and
 experience to perform this type of Work.
 
 Submit the WEAP analysis concurrent with the Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form. The
 Engineer will approve or reject the pile driving Equipment submittal after a review of the wave
 equation analysis conducted by the Contractor.
 Provide pile hammers meeting the following requirements based on wave equation analysis:
 • The energy of the submitted hammer shall produce a wave equation predicted blow
 count between 2 and 10 blows per inch for the nominal resistances, pile lengths and
 other conditions specified.
 • The pile stresses indicated by the wave equation at the nominal resistance shall not be
 greater than the stress at the point of impending damage to the pile as follows:
 • Steel Piles - Tensile and compressive stresses in the pile of 90 percent of the pile
 material's yield strength for the grade of steel specified at any time during the pile
 installation.
 • Prestressed Concrete Piles:
 • A tensile stress of (.095
 
 f ' c ) + effective prestress
 
 • A compressive stress of (0.85
 Where:
 
 f 'c
 
 f ' c ) - effective prestress
 
 = concrete compressive strength (ksi)
 
 • Timber Piles - A compressive driving stress of three times the allowable static design
 stress.
 410
 
 00520.20
 Hammers not meeting these requirements will be rejected. Replace rejected hammers with
 suitable hammers.
 Use input values for the wave equation analyses provided in the Special Provisions and
 according to the following:
 Use the following settings and default values as input to the wave equation analysis program:
 • Output option (IOUT) zero (normal option).
 • RN is the nominal pile bearing resistance.
 • Smith damping.
 • Do not use residual stress option.
 • Default hammer efficiency values. Do not adjust the hammer's efficiency outside of the
 wave equation program recommended (default) values without prior concurrence of both
 the pile hammer manufacturer and the Engineer.
 • % skin is the percent skin friction.
 A Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) test may be required prior to approval of non-default wave
 equation input values.
 At a minimum, provide the following information and documentation:
 • A written summary of how the proposed hammer and associated Equipment meets the
 Specifications regarding blow count criteria and allowable pile stresses.
 • Electronic and paper copies of the wave equation input and output files. Output files shall
 be in the standard WEAP output format.
 • WEAP analysis demonstrating that for the required nominal bearing resistances and
 conditions provided, the hammer will produce pile stresses less than those described
 above for the range of hammer strokes expected in the field.
 • The "Pile and Driving Equipment Data" form.
 • WEAP hammer input files for hammers not in the wave equation default hammer files.
 For Agency reviewing and approving of the wave equation analysis submittals, the following
 will be taken into consideration:
 • The pile length for use in the WEAP analysis will be the total pile length at the end of
 driving, including all pile length above the ground surface. This length may be longer
 than the Engineers Estimated length depending on the site conditions, Equipment used,
 pile hammer access limitations and other factors.
 • The properties and thicknesses of the hammer and pile cushion materials.
 • Various hammer types such as direct-drive diesel, standard diesel, air/steam or hydraulic
 hammers have major effects on predicted stresses and blow counts.
 • Changes in pile type or size will affect the blow count rate and pile stresses.
 • Battered piles may effect hammer energy transfer and blow counts.
 Failure to address these issues may be cause for rejection of the proposed pile hammer.
 The size of the pile hammer selected according to the above specification may have significant
 impacts on the size and capacity of associated Equipment including the leads and crane. This
 411
 
 00520.40
 Equipment, in turn, may have significant impacts on the size and capacity of work Bridges,
 shoring required for existing Structures or other aspects and elements of construction.
 Failure of a previously approved hammer to operate properly during construction will be cause
 for rejection.
 Construction
 00520.40 Preparation for Driving:
 (a) Excavation - Unless otherwise provided or authorized, do not drive piles until after
 excavation is complete. Remove to the correct elevation any material forced up by pile driving
 before concrete for the foundation is placed, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (b) Embankments - Unless otherwise provided or authorized, do not drive piles until the
 roadway embankment at bridge ends is in place according to 00330.42. Drive piles completely
 through roadway embankments to the required penetration and bearing in the underlying
 material.
 00520.41 Driving:
 (a) General - Drive piles as specified with approved pile driving Equipment to the required
 penetration depth and to the required nominal pile bearing resistance as shown or specified.
 (b) Installation Sequence - Unless otherwise shown or specified, install individual piles in pile
 groups starting from the center of the group and proceeding outward in either direction, or as
 approved.
 (c) Minimum Penetration - Unless otherwise specified or approved, drive piles at least 12 feet
 below the footing or pile cap, 12 feet below the groundline at trestle pile locations, and completely
 through embankments at bridge ends. When shown or specified drive piles to a greater minimum
 penetration.
 If the required penetration cannot be attained with a hammer complying
 with 00520.20(d), provide a larger hammer, prebore or jet holes, or use other approved methods
 as necessary to attain the required penetration.
 (d) Preboring - Use augering, wet-rotary drilling or other methods of preboring only when
 specified or with written approval. When allowed, prebore holes at pile locations and to the
 depths shown or directed. Make prebored holes smaller than the diameter or diagonal of the pile
 Cross Section, but sufficient to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface
 obstructions, such as Cobbles, Boulders or Rock layers are encountered, the hole diameter may
 be increased to the least dimension which is adequate for pile installation. The use of a
 reinforced section (spud) to loosen the subsurface material at pile locations will not be allowed
 unless otherwise approved.
 
 Perform preboring in a manner that will not impair the bearing or lateral capacity of the piles
 already in place or the safety of existing adjacent Structures. When it is determined that
 preboring has disturbed the load bearing resistances of previously installed piles, restore those
 piles that have been disturbed to conditions meeting the requirements of this Specification by
 redriving or by other acceptable methods. The Contractor shall be responsible for the costs of
 any necessary remedial measures unless the preboring method was specifically included in the
 Contract Documents and properly executed by the Contractor.
 (1) End-Bearing Piles - For end-bearing pile as classified by the Engineer, preboring may be
 carried to the surface of the end-bearing foundation material. Following that, drive pile with an
 approved impact pile hammer to the specified blow count.
 
 412
 
 00520.41
 (2) Other Piles - For other piles, extend preboring to the minimum pile penetration depth and
 then drive pile with an approved impact pile hammer to the specified blow count.
 
 After completion of driving, fill any void space remaining around the pile with sand or other
 approved material.
 (e) Jetting - Jetting may only be used when allowed in the Contract Documents or if approved in
 writing. When jetting is not required in the Contract Documents, but approved at the Contractor's
 request, determine and submit for review the number of jets and the volume and pressure of
 water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the material adjacent to the pile without
 affecting the lateral stability of the final in-place pile. The Contractor shall be responsible for all
 damage caused by unapproved or improper jetting operations, unless the jetting method was
 specifically included in the Contract Documents and properly executed by the Contractor.
 Control, treat if necessary, and dispose of all jet water in a satisfactory manner. Drive all jetted
 pile with an approved impact hammer.
 (f) Location and Alignment Tolerance - Place the tops of piles at plan cutoff elevation and
 horizontally within 6 inches of plan locations. No pile shall be nearer than 4 inches from any edge
 of the cap. Any increase in cap size to meet this edge distance requirement will be at no
 additional cost to the Agency.
 
 Install piles so the axial alignment of the top 10 feet of the pile is within 5 inches of the specified
 alignment. For piles that cannot be inspected after installation, make an alignment check before
 installing the last 5 feet of pile. The Engineer may require that driving be stopped to check the
 pile alignment. Pulling laterally on piles to correct misalignment or splicing a properly aligned
 section onto a misaligned section will not be allowed.
 If the specified location or alignment tolerances are exceeded, the effect of the pile misalignment
 on the Substructure design will be investigated. If the Engineer determines corrective measures
 are necessary, implement suitable measures and pay all costs and delays associated with the
 corrective action.
 (g) Heaved Piles - Make elevation readings on piles during pile driving operations to check on
 pile heave. Take elevation readings after each pile has been driven and again after piles within a
 radius of 15 feet have been driven. Redrive to the required penetration and resistance all piles
 that have risen more than 1/2 inch, at no additional cost to the Agency. Continue readings until
 the Engineer determines that such checking is no longer required. If pipe piles which have been
 filled with concrete subsequently heave, redrive them to original position, after the concrete has
 attained specified strength, with an approved hammer-pile cushion system.
 (h) Test Piles - When specified, furnish and drive test piles at the locations and to the lengths
 directed. All test piles shall be of the kind and size specified for the permanent foundation piles
 unless otherwise directed. Drive all test piles with approved pile driving Equipment. The
 specified length of test piles will be greater than the estimated length of production piles to
 provide for variation in Soil conditions. Drive test piles using driving Equipment identical to that
 which the Contractor proposes to use on the production piling. Excavate to the elevation of the
 bottom of the footing before driving test piles. (See Section 00510.)
 
 Drive test piles to or below the required minimum tip elevation and to a hammer blow count
 established by the Engineer. Allow test piles which do not attain the hammer blow count
 specified at the minimum tip elevation shown to "set up" for 24 hours, or less if directed, before
 being redriven. (See 00520.42(d).) If the tops of test piles reach plan grade without attaining the
 required pile bearing resistance, splice them and drive until the required bearing resistance is
 attained.
 413
 
 00520.42
 Remove test piles that are not to be incorporated in the completed Structure to at least 2 feet
 below the surface of the ground and backfill the remaining hole with acceptable material.
 Do not order piling to be used in the permanent Structure until test pile data has been reviewed
 and the production pile order lengths are determined. The Engineer will provide the Engineer's
 estimated length list or pile order list within 7 Calendar Days after completion of all test pile
 driving specified in the Contract.
 00520.42 Nominal Pile Bearing Resistance:
 (a) General - Drive piles with approved pile driving Equipment to the lengths necessary to attain
 the required penetration and nominal pile bearing resistance. Adequate pile penetration will be
 considered reached when the piles are driven to or below the minimum penetration depth and the
 specified bearing resistance is achieved. If piles do not achieve the specified resistance when
 driven to order length or estimated length, splice and drive them to penetrations established by
 the Engineer. The pile blow count shall be at a rate of between 2 and 10 blows per inch at the
 required nominal pile bearing resistance. The required number of hammer blows per inch at final
 penetration shall be maintained for 3 consecutive inches unless "refusal" driving is first obtained.
 "Refusal" driving is defined as 20 blows per 1 inch or as determined by the Engineer.
 
 If water jets are used with the driving, the bearing value shall be determined by the specified
 equation from the results of driving after the jetting has been completed according to 00520.42(e).
 (b) FHWA Gates Equation - Unless otherwise specified, the Engineer will determine nominal
 pile bearing resistance of the driven pile by the FHWA Gates equation:
 
 Rn =
 
 1.75 ( E ) log10(10N) - 100
 
 where:

 or N = 10 to the power in brackets
 The FHWA Gates equation is applicable only if:
 • The hammer is in good condition and operating in a satisfactory manner
 • The hammer has a free fall
 • A follower is not used
 • The head of the pile is not broomed or crushed
 If the Engineer determines that the hammer being used may not be attaining the specified
 bearing resistance when the above equation is applied, the Engineer may order the Contractor, at
 414
 
 00520.42
 no additional cost to the Agency, to verify the bearing resistance values obtained by the use of a
 different hammer.
 (c) Wave Equation Analysis - If specified, the Engineer will determine nominal pile bearing
 resistance based on wave equation analysis.
 (d) Set Period and Redriving - If piles do not attain the required nominal bearing resistance
 when driven to the specified length, and if allowed or required, allow the piles to stand for a "set
 period" without driving. The "set period" shall be a minimum of 24 hours. After the set period,
 perform check driving on either two piles in each bent or on one pile in every 10 piles, whichever
 is more. The Engineer will designate the piles on which check driving is to be performed. Do not
 use a cold hammer for redriving. Warm up the hammer before redriving begins by applying at
 least 20 blows to another pile. Redriving shall consist of driving the pile to the required bearing
 resistance with a maximum of 15 blows. If the specified hammer blow count is not attained on
 redriving, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to drive all of the remaining pile length and
 repeat the set period and redriving procedure. Splice those piles driven to plan grade that do not
 attain the hammer blow count required, and drive until the required bearing resistance is attained.
 If the required bearing resistance is attained for each pile that is redriven, then the remaining piles
 in that bent will be considered satisfactory when driven to at least the same penetration and
 resistance as the redriven piles.
 (e) Jetted Piles - The nominal pile bearing resistance of jetted piles will be based on impact
 driving blow count after jetting has been completed. Jet pipes may be removed when the pile tip
 is at the required minimum pile tip elevation and before the pile is driven to the required bearing
 resistance. For piles that are jetted at the Contractor's request and do not attain the required
 nominal bearing resistance at the ordered length, splice, as required, and drive with a specified
 impact pile hammer until the required nominal bearing resistance is achieved according to
 appropriate criteria in 00520.42. Regardless of Agency approval, the Contractor shall pay all
 costs of splicing and driving piles beyond the order length if jetting is requested by the Contractor.
 (f) Followers - The required nominal pile bearing resistance of piles driven with followers will
 only be considered acceptable when the follower-driven piles attain the same tip elevation as
 piles driven without followers. (See 00520.20(c)(4).)
 (g) Vibratory Hammers - The nominal bearing resistance of piles driven with vibratory hammers
 will be based on impact driving blow count after the vibratory Equipment has been removed.
 When vibratory installation of the piles is approved by the Engineer and the vibrated piles do not
 attain the required nominal bearing resistance at the specified length, splice them as required, at
 no additional cost to the Agency, and drive with a specified impact pile hammer until the required
 nominal bearing resistance is achieved, according to 00520.42.
 (h) Load Tests:
 (1) Static Load Test - Perform static load tests on foundation or test piles when specified or
 required. Conduct static load tests according to ASTM D1143 using the quick load test
 method to plunging failure or the capacity of the loading system. Use testing Equipment and
 measuring systems capable of applying 150 percent of the nominal pile bearing resistance
 or 1,000 tons, whichever is less.
 (2) Dynamic Load Tests - Take dynamic load test measurements during the driving of piles
 designated as dynamic load test piles as specified. Perform dynamic testing according to
 ASTM D4945.
 
 Drive the pile to such depth that the dynamic load test Equipment indicates that the nominal
 pile bearing resistance shown has been achieved, unless otherwise directed. Monitor the
 415
 
 00520.43
 stresses in the piles during driving with the dynamic test Equipment to ensure the values do
 not exceed the values in 00520.20(d)(3). If necessary, reduce the driving energy by using
 additional cushions or reduce the energy output of the hammer to stay below the values
 in 00520.20(d)(3). If non-axial driving is indicated by dynamic test Equipment measurements,
 immediately realign the driving system.
 00520.43 Steel Piles:
 (a) General - Unless otherwise specified, furnish standard steel piles in the longest practical
 lengths.
 (b) Storage and Handling - Store and handle steel piles in ways that protect them from
 damage. Bent or kinked piles will be rejected.
 (c) End Treatment - Cut pile ends square.
 (d) Reinforced Pile Tips - Install pile points, shoes, or other tip reinforcement according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations and Section 02520.
 (e) Driving - During driving, protect the pile head with a fitted metal helmet.
 (f) Splices - Where splices are unavoidable, submit for approval their number, location and
 details.
 (1) Welded Splices - Make welded splices using a full penetration butt weld, as shown.
 Comply with the welding procedures of AWS D1.1.
 (2) Mechanical Splices - Mechanical splices may be used if the splice transfers the full pile
 strength in compression, tension, and bending, according to unstamped Working Drawings
 submitted according to 00150.35 and approved by the Engineer.
 (g) Welding - Weld pile splices, pile tips, pile anchors, and other welded attachments to steel
 piles according to AWS D1.1.
 (1) Splices - Splice joints for pipe piles shall conform to Joint B-U4a or
 B-U4a-GF (Single-Bevel Groove Weld) in D1.1 Figure 3.4. Weld back-up rings with a full
 penetration groove weld. Pipe pile splices that include a steel plate for Soil plug formation
 shall conform to Joint TC-U4a or TC-U4a-GF.
 
 Splice joints for H-piles shall conform to Joint B-U3b or B-U3-GF (Double V-Groove Weld) in
 D1.1 Figure 3.4 for both the web and flange sections. Joint B-U4a or B-U4a-GF may be
 substituted on the flange weld. Provide access holes at the ends of the web according to
 D1.1 Section 5.17.
 (2) Submittals - Prior to welding, submit the following for approval:
 
 • A Welding Procedure Specification (WPS) for all pile welds, conforming to the limitations
 of D1.1 Table 4.5. Both ASTM A36 and ASTM A252 Grade 1 and 2 may be treated as
 prequalified base metals under Group 1. ASTM A252 Grade 3 will not be considered a
 prequalified base metal unless the steel has a Carbon Equivalent (CE) of 0.30 percent
 or less. Develop a Procedure Qualification Record (PQR) for all welding using
 Grade 3 steel or present proof that the chemistry of the steel meets the CE requirements.
 • Qualification documents for each welder.
 Use welders qualified according to
 D1.1 Section 4 for the position, process and pile diameter used on the job.
 416
 
 00520.44
 Do not begin welding without approval.
 Following completion of all welding, submit the following:
 • An inspection report stating that the welding under the Contract was performed according
 to D1.1. The report shall include a review of the WPS, a review of welder qualifications
 and a report on visual inspection of the welds on the job site. The inspection shall be
 signed by a Certified Welding Inspector (CWI) holding QC1 certification as defined in
 D1.1 Section 6.
 • If the Plans or Specifications call for additional inspection other than visual, include
 reports in the submittal.
 (3) Additional Testing - The Engineer may request additional nondestructive testing (NDT),
 such as radiography or ultrasonic testing of any or all welds. If the additional testing identifies
 defects warranting rejection, perform repair and additional inspection at no additional cost to
 the Agency. If the additional NDT does not identify defects warranting rejection, the Agency
 will pay the cost of the additional testing. Radiographic and ultrasonic defect indications will be
 evaluated according to the statically loaded criteria of D1.1.

 Measurement
 00530.80 Measurement - The quantities of reinforcement will be measured by one of the following
 methods:
 (a) Lump Sum - Under this method, no measurement will be made. Estimated quantities of
 reinforcement will be listed in the Special Provisions. The weight of reinforcement in prestressed
 beams, slabs, piles and other items where the reinforcement is included in those items will not be
 included in the listed estimated quantities.
 (b) Weight - Under this method, reinforcement will be measured on the weight basis, of
 reinforcement incorporated into the concrete based on the total computed weight for the sizes
 and lengths of bars as shown or authorized.
 
 The following assumed densities will be used as a basis for computing the theoretical weight of
 miscellaneous metal:
 Steel
 Copper
 Cast Iron -
 
 490 pounds/cubic foot
 555 pounds/cubic foot
 450 pounds/cubic foot
 
 The weight of mesh will be computed from the theoretical weight of plain wire. If the weight per
 square foot is shown, that weight will be used.
 For the purpose of computing weight of reinforcement, weights published in the CRSI "Manual of
 Standard Practice" will be used.
 The weight of reinforcement in prestressed beams, slabs, piles and other items where the
 reinforcement is included in those items will not be included in the listed quantities.
 If bars are substituted at the Contractor's request, and as a result, more steel is used than
 specified, only the amount specified will be included in the pay quantities. When laps are made
 for splices for the convenience of the Contractor, the extra reinforcement will not be included in
 the pay quantities.

 Correct the load or, if the load cannot be corrected, do not incorporate it into the Work. Test
 subsequent loads before any further concrete placement. Correct subsequent loads if any of
 the tests are still outside the specification limits. Return to the specified test frequency when
 the test results from two consecutive loads are shown to meet the specification limits.
 00540.17 Acceptance of Concrete - Acceptance of concrete will be according to Section 00165
 and the following:
 (a) Aggregate - Acceptance will be based on the Contractor's quality control testing, if verified,
 according to Section 00165.
 (1) Aggregate Gradation - A stockpile contains specification Aggregate gradation when the
 quality level for each sieve size calculated according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than
 the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 for a PF of 1.00. Each required sample represents
 a sublot. When the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 yields a PF of less than 1.00 for
 any constituent, the material is non-specification.
 (2) Non-specification Aggregate Gradation - Stockpiled Aggregates that contain
 non-specification Aggregate gradation will be rejected by the Engineer unless non-specification
 material is removed from the stockpile. Do not add additional material to the stockpile until
 enough non-specification material is removed so that the quality level for each constituent is
 equal to or greater than the quality level in Table 00165-2 for a 1.00 PF.
 (b) Plastic Concrete - Acceptance of plastic concrete will be based on tests performed by the
 Contractor's QCT, according to the tolerances and limits of 02001.20.
 
 440
 
 00540.22
 (c) Hardened Concrete - Cast and cure test specimens according to AASHTO T 23
 in 6 inch x 12 inch or 4 inch x 8 inch, single-use plastic molds and test at 28 days according
 to AASHTO T 22.
 (1) General - For all classes of concrete, acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on
 an analysis of compressive strength tests of cylinders cast by the QCT. Test cylinders at an
 Agency certified laboratory.
 (2) Actual Strength Test Value - The ASTV at 28 days is the average compressive strength
 of the three cylinders tested. If the compressive strength of a single test specimen varies by
 more than 10 percent from the average of the other two specimens, that compressive strength
 value will be discarded. The average compressive strength test of the two remaining
 specimens will be the ASTV.
 (3) Acceptance - Hardened concrete with an ASTV meeting or exceeding the specified
 design strength, 'c will be accepted for strength. If the ASTV is less than 'c but at least
 85 percent of 'c, the Engineer may review the results to determine if the concrete represented
 by the cylinders is suitable for the intended purpose. Remove concrete that has an ASTV less
 than 85 percent of 'c unless otherwise authorized, in writing, by the Engineer. If the concrete
 is removed, the cost of removal, replacement and all related Work is the Contractor's
 responsibility. If the Engineer determines that the concrete is suitable for the intended
 purpose, the concrete may be allowed to remain in place, subject to a price adjustment
 according to 00150.25.
 
 If an ASTV falls below ƒ'c, the Contractor may submit a written plan outlining a proposed
 alternate method of evaluating compressive strength. Submit the plan for review by the
 Engineer within 3 days of the test. Provide evidence that a reasonable 'cr (over-design) was
 maintained and that there is credible evidence (besides low strength) which warrants
 consideration of this option. The Engineer may allow an alternate method of acceptance if the
 compressive strength test results are determined to be suspect from definable external factors.

 Falsework Design Checklist to accompany the Plans and calculations. Include in the summary a
 list of each falsework member with its:
 • Assumed dead and live loads
 • Allowable and design stresses
 • Allowable and calculated deflections
 • Design references and derivations for design formulas
 • Documentation for computer-generated calculations
 The Falsework Design Checklist is included in the Special Provisions.
 
 444
 
 00540.41
 Submit five sets (nine sets if Railroad approval is required) of the Plans and three copies (five
 copies if Railroad approval is required) of the calculations, summary, and checklist.
 Design falsework according to the current edition of "AASHTO Guide Design Specifications for
 Bridge Temporary Works" except where in conflict with these Specifications.
 (b) General Design Loads - Design and construct falsework to support the total applied loads
 and provide enough redundancy in the design to prevent a failure of the entire system.
 
 Ensure design loads used are the maximum loadings. Ensure deflections used on manufactured
 devices and assemblies do not exceed the manufacturer's recommendations. Furnish catalog
 data that lists the manufacturer's recommendations.
 (c) Falsework Foundation:
 (1) On Soils - Consider anticipated construction and Soil conditions in determining the Soil's
 support capacity, including draining water away from the supports. For falsework supported on
 Soils, show the following in the calculations:
 
 • Assumptions and methods used to determine the Soil's capacity to support the footing
 loads.
 • Anticipated falsework footing settlement based on the allowable Soil bearing values.
 (2) On Piles - For falsework supported on piles, show on the Working Drawings the pile type,
 size and spacing. Accompany these drawings with calculations which show the assumptions
 and methods used to design the piles and the bearing values to which the piles need to be
 driven to support the calculated loads.
 (d) Requirements at Highway and Railroad Traffic Openings - For falsework adjacent to or
 spanning a Highway or railroad traffic opening, do the following:
 
 • Design the posts using a minimum elastic section modulus, about each axis, of:
 • 12.2 cubic inches for structural steel
 • 244 cubic inches for timber
 • Increase the vertical post load 150 percent. If the load on the falsework will be increased by
 load transfer due to prestressing, increase the vertical post load by the additional load due
 to prestressing or by 150 percent, whichever is greater.
 • Provide mechanical connections for posts to supporting footing with capacity to resist a
 minimum lateral force of 2,000 pounds applied in any direction at the base of the post.
 • Provide mechanical connections between top of posts and the cap or stringer capable of
 resisting a lateral force of 1,000 pounds from any direction.

 • Design bracing so that the bent will resist the required horizontal load or 500 pounds,
 whichever is greater.
 445
 
 00540.42
 • Provide solid sheathing of 5/8 inch thick plywood between 3 feet and 16 feet above the top
 of the rail, properly blocked at the edges.
 • On falsework Plans, show:
 • Collision posts if they are required
 • Soffit and deck overhang forming details
 00540.42 Falsework Construction - Construct falsework according to the current edition of
 "AASHTO Construction Handbook for Bridge Temporary Works", except where in conflict with these
 Specifications. Assure that falsework is constructed according to the falsework design and on Soils
 equal to or exceeding design assumptions. Within 2 days of notice of the falsework design
 engineer's pending inspection, the Engineer will provide a list of construction concerns. Do not
 place concrete until the falsework design engineer of record, accompanied by the Engineer, field
 inspects that portion of the falsework proposed for use. Do not place concrete until all construction
 concerns have been addressed, the falsework design engineer furnishes the Engineer a written
 statement that the falsework conforms to the design and will serve the intended use, and the
 Engineer agrees in writing that the falsework will serve the intended use.
 
 Set falsework to give the finished Structure the Camber shown or specified.
 Install telltales on falsework at locations as directed and use jacks, hardwood wedges or other
 methods approved, to take up settlement in the formwork.
 When used, provide sand jacks consisting of a metal piston and metal frame filled with compacted,
 clean, dry sand. Ensure the annular space between the top bearing plate or piston and the frame
 does not exceed 1/4 inch.
 Use temporary concrete barriers according to 00225.12(c) to protect falsework from damage from
 adjacent traffic. Make provisions to prevent damage by debris in streams.
 Upon completion of the Structure, remove all falsework to at least 24 inches below ground line or
 streambed.
 Limit the height of timber blocking and wedging to 24 inches, or to less than 1 1/2 times the least
 horizontal dimension of the blocking or wedges, whichever is smaller. Limit post, shim pack and
 wedging assemblies supporting beams to six faying (interface or contact) surfaces. Ensure adjacent
 beam support assemblies do not have a difference of more than two faying surfaces. Ensure timber
 blocks loaded perpendicular to the grain are free of splits.
 For post-tensioned Structures, do not remove falsework until post-tensioning is complete.
 00540.43 Joints - Construct joints in concrete Bridges according to details shown or directed.
 (a) Construction Joints - Make construction joints between concrete placements only where
 shown or specified unless otherwise approved.
 
 Do not form construction joints in concrete exposed to salt water between levels of extreme low
 and high water. Where concrete may be exposed to the action of alkaline water or Soil, place
 concrete continuous until completion of the section, or until the concrete is at least 18 inches
 above the ground or high water level.
 Unless otherwise shown, provide construction joints with a roughened surface. Do not smooth or
 trowel Aggregate into the cement paste. Provide a minimum deviation from a plane surface or
 1/4 inch and a maximum deviation from a plane surface equal to the maximum size of Aggregate
 in the specified class of concrete.
 446
 
 00540.45
 Apply a concrete surface retarder according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Remove
 surface mortar within the time period recommended by the manufacturer and clean the joint
 surface and reinforcing steel by removing loosened particles of Aggregate, damaged concrete,
 unconsolidated concrete and surface laitance with a high pressure washer conforming to
 00540.28 to the extent that clean Aggregate (free of surface mortar) is exposed on 50 percent of
 the surface. Clean the joint surface again immediately prior to the concrete placement to remove
 any subsequent deposits of dirt, debris or other foreign materials. Saturate the joint surface with
 potable water immediately before resuming concrete placement. Remove standing water in
 depressions or hollows of the joint surface.
 Saw cut the top 1 inch of the deck joints with a straight vertical cut before subsequent concrete
 placement and before saturating the surface with water. Where joints are straight and without
 spalls, the Engineer may waive this saw cut requirement.
 Hand rub or brush fresh concrete paste onto the existing surface of vertical deck joints down to
 the top mat of reinforcing steel at the beginning of subsequent concrete placement.
 Stay in place joint forms are not allowed in bridge deck construction joints.
 (b) Open Joints - Locate open joints as shown. Construct the form so the form support system
 may be released as soon as the concrete takes its initial set. Do not chip or break the corners of
 the concrete when removing forms. Do not extend reinforcing bars across an open joint unless
 shown.
 (c) Joints with Fillers - Construct joints with preformed expansion joint fillers or poured fillers as
 shown and according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the filler used. Provide a
 3/4 inch chamfer on each edge of the joint unless otherwise noted.
 (d) Bridge Deck Expansion Joints - Construct expansion joints for bridge decks as shown and
 according to Section 00585.
 00540.44 Foundations - Place concrete foundations for Structures on suitable Soil or Rock bearing
 surfaces, concrete seals or piles as shown. Excavate and backfill according to Section 00510.
 00540.45 Construction of Forms - Construct forms that:
 • Conform to ACI 347 and ACI SP-4.
 
 • Are mortar-tight and sufficiently rigid to conform to and maintain the specified dimensions and
 tolerances.
 • Provide a 3/4 inch chamfer on all exposed concrete edges unless otherwise noted.
 • Provide a smooth concrete surface unless otherwise specified.
 • Are constructed so portions may be removed without disturbing forms that are to remain.
 • Are treated with a release agent that is not detrimental to the concrete.
 • Are cleaned of dirt, sawdust, excess water and other foreign material before placing concrete
 in the forms.
 • Are saturated with water immediately before placing concrete and kept damp during
 placement.
 • Are retightened before depositing new concrete on or against concrete which has hardened.
 
 447
 
 00540.47
 On Structures located within 25 aerial miles of the Pacific Ocean, remove metal ties and anchorages
 to a depth of 2 inches from accessible surfaces. Remove fiberglass form ties and anchorages to a
 depth of 1 inch from accessible surfaces.
 On Structures located more than 25 aerial miles from the Pacific Ocean, construct ties or
 anchorages within the forms so they can be removed to a depth of at least 1 inch from accessible
 surfaces.
 Install embedded conduit 2 inches clear of the nearest face of concrete.
 Secure in place expanded polystyrene forms and spacers between adjacent concrete placements to
 prevent floating or displacement during concrete placement. Carefully cut joints in expanded
 polystyrene and fill with a suitable filler or mastic to prevent intrusion of concrete mortar. After the
 concrete has hardened, completely remove expanded polystyrene unless otherwise stated.
 Permanent stay-in-place bridge deck forms are not allowed unless shown otherwise.
 (a) Footings - When footings are not founded in firm Rock, concrete may be placed without
 forms if the excavation does not exceed the tolerances of 00540.40(a)(3)(b).
 
 Do not form portions of footings founded in firm Rock. Place concrete against undisturbed Rock,
 filling the overbreak to the top of Rock or top of footing.
 (b) Accessible Box Girder Cells - Falsework and deck forms for accessible box girder cells
 may be supported by girder stems or bottom slab provided the bottom slab is fully supported and
 designed to take additional loading from deck forms and falsework, deck concrete, and concrete
 placement forces.
 (c) Inaccessible Box Girder Cells - Falsework and deck forms for inaccessible box girder cells
 may be left in place provided:
 
 • Falsework and deck forms left in place are not supported off the bottom slab. Falsework
 and deck forms supported by girder stems are allowed.
 • 1/2 inch preformed expansion joint filler are placed between the end of deck forms and
 transverse beams and at 25 foot spacing in the deck forms.
 • Box girder cells are cleared of materials and forms except as necessary to support the deck
 slab before the deck forming is complete.
 (d) Form Maintenance - Set forms and maintain them true to designated line and grade until the
 concrete hardens. When forms appear to be unsatisfactory, either before or during the placing of
 concrete, the Engineer may order the Work stopped until the defects have been corrected. Leave
 forms in place for periods specified in 00540.52.
 00540.47 Delivering Concrete - Schedule delivery of concrete to ensure continuous delivery
 during placement. For all placements except seal and deck placements, ensure the interval
 between the end of one load and the start of the next load does not exceed 20 minutes.
 See 00540.48 for seal and deck placements.
 
 If the requirements of the previous paragraph are not met, the Engineer will determine whether the
 concrete has taken its initial set and may order a bulkhead installed or removal of concrete in the
 affected placement.
 
 448
 
 00540.48
 00540.48 Handling and Placing Concrete:
 (a) General - Do not place concrete under water or in flowing water unless specifically
 authorized. Place concrete:
 
 • In the sequence shown or as approved.
 • In its final position in the forms within 1 1/2 hours after the addition of the cement to the
 Aggregate. A retarder may be used or required. Use a retarder from the QPL and furnish at
 no additional cost to the Agency.
 • As close as possible to its final position and consolidated to:
 • Avoid segregation of the materials and displacement of the reinforcement
 • Produce a dense, homogeneous concrete, free of voids and Rock pockets
 • Through pumps, chutes or trunks conforming to 00540.22, when placement requires
 dropping concrete more than 5 feet. Place the bottom of pump hose, chutes, pipes or
 trunks as close to final placement position as practicable.
 • In layers not more than 18 inches thick, except for seal concrete placement, and unless
 shown otherwise. Place and consolidate each layer before the preceding layer has taken
 initial set to avoid surfaces of separation between the layers.
 Do not place concrete prior to complete approval of:
 • The excavation and the bearing material in a foundation
 • Installed piling
 • The falsework and forms
 • Placed reinforcing steel
 After initial set of the concrete, do not disturb the forms or place loads on the ends of reinforcing
 bars projecting from the concrete placement until allowed by 00540.52.
 (b) Pumping Concrete - Pump concrete with pumping Equipment conforming to 00540.22.
 Pump a cement-water slurry through the lines before starting the mix through the pump. Operate
 the pump in a manner that produces a continuous stream of concrete without air pockets or
 segregation. When a placement nears completion, if concrete remaining in the pipeline is to be
 used, remove it in a manner that will not cause contamination of the concrete already in place.
 
 There will be no extra payment for additional cement or additives required to ensure a mix is
 pumpable.
 (c) Vibrating Concrete - Except for seal concrete, thoroughly consolidate fresh concrete
 according to the following:
 
 • Vibrate concrete internally using mechanical vibrating Equipment.
 • Provide an extra vibrator for emergency use.
 • Re-vibration of concrete may be required as directed.
 Apply vibration at the point of freshly deposited concrete. Apply vertically at points uniformly
 spaced not farther apart than 1 1/2 the radius over which the vibration is visibly effective.
 Penetrate into previously placed plastic layers.
 
 449
 
 00540.48
 Do not use vibrators to make concrete flow or to move concrete from one point to another in the
 forms. Do not apply directly on or through the reinforcement to sections or layers of concrete
 which have hardened to the degree that the concrete ceases to be plastic under vibration.
 Supplement vibration by spading as necessary to ensure smooth surfaces and dense concrete
 along form surfaces and in corners or other locations impossible to reach with vibrators.
 Continue vibration until the concrete is thoroughly consolidated.
 segregation occurs or localized areas of grout form.
 
 Discontinue vibration if
 
 (d) Concrete Exposed to Salt Water, Alkaline Water, or Soil - For concrete exposed to salt
 water, see 00540.43(a) for location of construction joints, and 00540.53 for surface finish
 requirements.
 
 Do not allow alkaline water or Soil to contact the concrete during placement or for a period of at
 least 72 hours after placement. See 00540.43(a) for location of construction joints.
 (e) Seal Concrete - Deposit seal concrete in still water near its final position, by means of a
 tremie seal pipe meeting the requirements of 00540.22(d) or a concrete pump with a rigidly held
 discharge line to prevent unwanted vertical movement. Place seal concrete continuously from
 start to finish, at a rate of at least 50 cubic yards per hour, keeping the surface of the concrete
 nearly horizontal at all times. Place each increase in height before the preceding concrete has
 taken its initial set.
 
 Do not use vibrators.
 At the start of the Work and on any withdrawal of the pipe, close the discharge end to prevent
 water entering the pipe. During the progress of the Work, keep the pipe full of concrete to the
 bottom of the hopper. When concrete is dumped into the hopper, start the flow of concrete by
 slightly raising the discharge end, always keeping it in the deposited concrete. Control the
 elevation of water inside the cofferdam to prevent any flow through the seal.
 Dewatering may proceed when the concrete seal has achieved a compressive strength
 of 2,200 psi. Remove high spots, laitance and other unsatisfactory material from the exposed
 surface.
 (f) Walls, Abutments, Bents, Piers, Columns, Beams, Girders, and Slabs - Place concrete
 following the sequences shown and the delay period specified in 00540.52.
 
 Delay placement for the Superstructure until the column forms have been stripped sufficiently to
 determine the character of the column concrete. Ensure Superstructure loads are not carried by
 the bents or piers until the concrete has been in place and has attained the strength specified
 in 00540.52.
 Stop placement for the bottom slab of box girder Structures at the bottom of beam stems or
 bottom of stem fillets. Before placing concrete in the stems, wait for a period not less than that
 specified in 00540.52.
 Stop placement for T-beams and box girder stems at the bottom of the deck fillet. Before placing
 deck concrete, wait for a period not less than that specified in 00540.52.
 (g) Bridge Decks - Use deck finishing machines conforming to 00540.24 and set to run parallel
 to the skew of the bent lines. Place screed rails outside the finishing area. Extend screed rails
 beyond both ends of the scheduled placement length for a distance that allows the finishing
 machine to reach all of the concrete.
 
 450
 
 00540.49
 For Bridges with continuous spans, ensure reinforcing steel is in place and tied in any adjacent
 span in the continuous Bridge segment before placing concrete.
 Before placing concrete, operate the finishing machine the length of the proposed placement, and
 check the deck thickness and clearance from the screed to the reinforcing steel in the presence
 of the Engineer, by an approved method. The permissible variation from the clearance indicated
 will be plus or minus 1/4 inch. Make necessary corrections before beginning the placement.
 Furnish transverse work Bridges according to 00540.29. Extend the screed rails beyond the start
 end to allow placement of all transverse work Bridges on the screed rails before placement of
 concrete begins.
 Do not place bridge deck concrete until the Engineer is satisfied that the Contractor:
 • Meets the requirements of 00540.41, 00540.45 through 00540.49, and 00540.52.
 • Has the finishing machine and transverse work Bridges placed and ready on the screed
 rails.
 • Is able to deliver concrete for decks so deck placement progresses at a rate of not less than
 20 feet per hour.
 • Proceeds up grade from the lowest deck elevation, unless otherwise shown.
 • Is able to produce and place concrete at a rate sufficient to complete proposed placement
 and finishing operations within the specified time.
 • Illuminates the work area during hours of darkness.
 • Has experienced concrete finishers and necessary finishing tools and Equipment at the
 work site.
 • Provides wind breaks, fog spray, or other approved methods when the concrete surface is
 exposed to conditions which may cause premature drying during placement operations.
 • Has saturated the tops of precast prestressed concrete members and formwork by applying
 continuous water for a minimum of 2 hours immediately prior to beginning deck placement.
 If delays occur lasting longer than 30 minutes, the Engineer may order construction of a
 bulkhead. If a bulkhead is constructed, do not begin further placement in that span or the
 adjacent falsework span, if any, for at least 24 hours. Construct bulkheads only where shown or
 when directed by the Engineer.
 00540.49 Weather Conditions for Concreting:
 (a) All Concrete Placement:
 (1) Hot Weather - Maintain the concrete temperature during hot weather as specified. When
 concrete temperatures approach 80 F, take appropriate action to lower concrete temperature.
 
 Do not place concrete on or in forms if surface temperature of forms or reinforcing steel
 is 90 F or above.
 (2) Cold Weather:
 a. General - Do not place concrete if the air temperature is, or is forecast to be, below
 40 F the Day of placement or is forecast to be below 40 °F on any of the next 7 Calendar
 Days (14 Calendar Days for decks) after placement, unless a Cold Weather Plan has been
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 451
 
 00540.49
 To place concrete when the temperature is below 40 °F, submit a Cold Weather Plan that
 identifies the methods that will be used to prevent the concrete temperature from falling
 below 50 °F. Methods include heated enclosures and insulated forms. Also include in the
 plan measures that will be taken if the concrete temperature falls below 50 °F. Provide
 a 24 hour continuous recording thermometer to verify the concrete temperature.
 Keep the foundation, form surfaces and reinforcing steel free of frost and ice.
 Ensure the temperature of the concrete is not less than 60 F when placed in the forms. If
 air temperature is below 40 F, heat mixing water to a temperature of at least 70 F, but not
 more than 150 F, or heat the Aggregates with either steam or dry heat. Ensure the
 temperature of concrete produced with heated Aggregate, heated water, or both does not
 exceed 80 F before placing.
 b. Enclosures - If enclosures are used, do the following:
 
 • Furnish and use, within the enclosure, a 24-hour continuous temperature/humidity
 recorder to record the air temperature and relative humidity every hour during the cure
 period.
 • Supply and maintain curing moisture and heat in the enclosure for 7 Calendar Days
 (14 Calendar Days for bridge decks) after placing concrete as follows:
 • Relative humidity of at least 40 percent.
 • Air temperature between 60 F and 80 F.
 c. Insulated Forms - When approved by the Engineer, insulated forms, capable of
 maintaining the surface of the concrete at not less than 50 F for a period of 7 Calendar
 Days (14 Calendar Days for bridge decks), may be used instead of enclosures and heating.
 If forms are insulated, protect exposed horizontal surfaces with a similar layer of insulating
 material securely fastened in place. If the insulated forms do not maintain the proper
 temperature at the concrete surface, use auxiliary protection, and provide additional heat
 and thermometer, as described in (b) above.
 (b) Bridge Deck Placement - Place concrete for bridge decks:
 
 • Only if precipitation is not forecast between 2 hours before and 2 hours after the scheduled
 placement duration. An acceptable forecast will have less than 30 percent chance of
 precipitation for the entire placement window. Provide, from an agreed upon weather
 forecast service, a forecast to the Engineer 1 hour before placement.
 • Only if not raining and the combination of air temperature, relative humidity, concrete
 temperature and wind velocity produces an evaporation rate of less than 0.10 pounds per
 square foot of surface area per hour, according to Figure 00540-1, or
 • Within an enclosure, according to 00540.49(a)(2)(b).

 00540.50 Bridge Deck Roadway and Sidewalk Finish:
 (a) General - After the bridge deck roadway and sidewalk concrete is placed and consolidated,
 strike it off to lines, grades and Cross Sections shown.
 (b) Deck Roadway Finish - After the deck roadway concrete has been screeded with a finishing
 machine conforming to 00540.24, float, if necessary, to produce a uniform surface, according
 to 00540.55. If the Work does not conform to the prescribed limits, stop the operation until
 revised methods, changes in Equipment, or correction of procedures are approved for trial. Also
 stop the revised operation if it does not produce a specified surface.
 (c) Deck Roadway Texturing - After correcting any non-specification surface tolerance
 according to 00540.55, texture the deck roadway surface with a saw that cuts grooves into the
 bridge deck as follows:
 
 • Cut grooves 1/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch to 3/16 inches deep.
 • Space grooves randomly from 3/4 inch to 1 1/2 inches apart with a minimum of 12 grooves
 for every foot of deck surface. Measure groove spacing parallel to the roadway centerline.
 • Orient the grooves perpendicular to the roadway centerline and full width of the Roadway
 except leave smooth strips 16 inches wide along each curb face. Do not overlap grooves.
 • Do not groove within 6 inches of joint blockouts and bridge ends. For skewed Bridges,
 additional ungrooved portions at joint blockouts and bridge ends are allowed to
 accommodate the width of the gang saw.
 • Continuously remove saw slurry and laitance from the sawing operation while cutting
 grooves.
 • Cut grooves after the bridge deck has been checked for non-specification surface
 tolerances as required by 00540.55 and after the water cure is complete.
 • Cut grooves no sooner than 14 days after the deck is cast. Cut grooves before opening the
 Roadway to traffic. For Structures constructed in stages, the Roadway may be opened to
 traffic before cutting grooves provided the time period from opening to actual construction of
 grooves is between June 1 and October 1.
 (d) Deck Sidewalk Finish - After the deck sidewalk surface has been struck off with a strike
 board, float it with a wooden or cork float. Use an edging tool on edges and at expansion joints.
 Remove edging tool marks prior to final finishing. Apply a light broom texture to the surface.
 00540.51 Curing Concrete:
 (a) General Requirements - Cure cast-in-place concrete with water. Begin curing as soon after
 placement as possible without damaging the freshly placed concrete. Continue curing
 for 7 Calendar Days (14 Calendar Days for bridge decks) after placement.
 
 Keep surfaces not covered by waterproof forms damp by applying water with a fog nozzle until
 the surface has set sufficiently to allow sprinkling with water or covering with wet burlap or an
 approved wet or dry material.
 Do not interrupt curing for more than 1 hour during the curing period.
 (b) Curing Concrete Bridge Decks - In addition to requirements of 00540.49, cure cast-in-place
 concrete bridge deck surfaces by doing the following:
 
 • Provide wind breaks or other approved methods when exposed to conditions which may
 cause premature drying during placement operations. Premature drying is defined as an
 454
 
 00540.52
 evaporation rate equal to or greater than 0.10 pounds per square foot per hour, as
 determined from Figure 00540-1, or as the loss of surface sheen when the evaporation rate
 at the surface exceeds the bleed rate.
 • Provide high pressure washers, according to 00540.28, fitted with fog nozzles during all
 deck placements to prevent and control premature drying. Apply fog spray upwind of the
 concrete placement during finishing. The purpose of fogging is to maintain a layer of high
 humidity above the concrete surface in order to minimize water loss in the mix after
 placement and before application of cure. Do not allow larger water droplets that drip from
 nozzles to fall onto the freshly finished plastic concrete.
 • Cover the concrete with a single layer of clean initial covering immediately after finishing.
 Apply initial covering no later than 20 minutes after final Pass of the finishing machine and
 no greater than 20 feet from the back of the finishing machine. Provide an initial covering
 with a minimum length sufficient to cover the bridge deck from side to side of the concrete
 placement. Use one of the following:
 • Saturated wet burlap having a minimum dry weight of 10 ounces per yard for material
 40 inches wide. Presoak the burlap by immersing it completely in water for 72 hours prior
 to the deck placement and presoak new burlap with a wetting agent. Overlap the edges
 at least 6 inches.
 • Nonwoven, needle punched polypropylene fabric curing blanket from the QPL.
 Thoroughly wet fabric within 15 minutes of fabric placement. Overlap the edges at
 least 12 inches.
 • Provide soaker hoses for additional soaking of the initial covering. Place over the full width
 of the concrete placement, at a maximum of 10 foot intervals. Do not allow initial wetting of
 burlap or fabric to dry before soaker hoses are in place and operational. Operate soaker
 hoses continuously to keep the initial covering saturated.
 • Place a layer of 4 mil polyethylene film over the initial covering and soaker hoses. Provide
 clear or white polyethylene film if the air temperature is forecasted to be above 65 °F within
 24 hours of the concrete placement, and black at other times, as determined by the
 Engineer. Overlap the edges of polyethylene film by 12 inches. Keep the film in place by
 taping and weighting the edges where they overlap or are vulnerable to movement by wind.
 Once a particular type of film has been placed, do not change it during the curing period.
 • Maintain a continuous water cure of the concrete surface for 14 days.
 (c) Additional Cure Time - If, during the cure time, the surrounding temperature falls
 below 45 F, extend the cure for the number of hours the temperature is below 45 F.
 00540.52 Removal of Forms and Falsework, and Subsequent Loading - Do not remove forms
 and falsework or place subsequent loads without approval.
 
 In determining when to remove forms and falsework, and when to place subsequent loads, the
 Engineer will consider the Contractor's proposed schedule, the location and character of the
 Structure, the weather, and other conditions influencing the setting of the concrete. If appropriate,
 these operations will be controlled by compressive strength tests of cylinders cast by the Contractor
 and witnessed by the Engineer. Test the cylinders at a recognized testing laboratory at no
 additional cost to the Agency. Cast and cure cylinders according to AASHTO T 23 (field cured)
 which is equivalent to the most unfavorable field conditions for the portions of the concrete which the
 cylinders represent.
 Forms and falsework may be removed and subsequent loads may be placed when both conditions
 of Table 00540-1 are met.

 Early removal of forms does not eliminate the curing requirement of 00540.51.
 Remove forms and falsework:
 • With methods not likely to deface, damage, or cause overstressing of the concrete.
 • In a manner that permits the concrete to uniformly and gradually take the stresses due to its
 own weight.
 • From the interior of structural steel box girders.
 • From accessible concrete box girder cells before any loading, post-tensioning or removal of
 the supporting falsework.
 • From all decks after subsequent loading is authorized, except those necessary to support the
 deck slab in inaccessible cells.
 Dispose of forms and falsework according to 00290.20(c).
 00540.53 Surface Finish Other Than Bridge Decks - Provide concrete surfaces with a general
 surface finish unless otherwise shown or specified. See 00540.50 for bridge deck and sidewalk
 surface finishing. Leave concrete surfaces unfinished as they come from the forms when exposed
 to salt water between the levels of extreme low and high water, except for needed repairs.
 
 If a Class 1 or Class 2 surface finish is required, it will not include the interior sides of girders and
 the underside of decks between girders. Finish Class 1 and Class 2 surfaces to a point 1 foot
 below finished ground line.
 (a) General Surface Finish - Give all concrete surfaces a general surface finish prior to the
 higher class finish specified for a particular item of Work. A general surface finish consists of the
 following:
 (1) On All Surfaces:
 
 • Remove form bolts and metal to a depth of 1 inch, 2 inches on Structures within 25 aerial
 miles of the Pacific Ocean.
 • Remove Rock pockets and unsound concrete.
 • Fill holes and depressions at least 1/4 inch in depth or diameter with an approved PCC
 repair material.
 (2) On All Exposed Surfaces:
 
 • Correct bulges, fins, depressions, stains, discolorations and other imperfections.
 • Slope formed surfaces with respect to the specified plane at a rate not to exceed the
 following amounts in 10 feet, if required:
 • Watertight joints: 1/8 inch
 • Other exposed surfaces: 1 1/2 inch
 • Concealed surfaces: 1 inch
 • Slope unformed, exposed surfaces, other than Pavements and sidewalks, with respect to
 the specified plane at a rate not to exceed the following, if required:
 • In 10 feet: 1/4 inch
 • In 20 feet: 3/8 inch
 The Engineer will determine the extent of the required repairs.
 457
 
 00540.54
 (b) Class 1 Surface Finish (Ground and Coated) - After completion of the general surface
 finish, grind the surface with a power grinder or an equivalent method to remove laitance and
 surface film. Apply coating according to (d) below.
 (c) Class 2 Surface Finish (Ground, Floated and Coated or Uncoated) - After completion of
 the general surface finish, grind the surface with a power grinder or an equivalent method to
 remove laitance and surface film. Float the surface with a rubber or sponge float, using a paste
 of fine mortar sand, cement, water, and bonding agent to fill air holes or voids and to bring the
 surface to a uniform texture. Keep the retextured surface damp a minimum of 12 hours or until
 the paste has set, whichever is longer. If dusting occurs after the retextured surface sets and is
 rubbed, refinish the surface.
 
 After the paste has set for a minimum of 24 hours, apply coating according to (d) below.
 (d) Concrete Coating - Apply either a concrete paint or a concrete stain or sealer as shown or
 specified. Where a Class 1 or Class 2 surface finish is shown, apply a concrete paint unless
 specified or shown otherwise.
 (1) Concrete Paint - Thoroughly saturate the surface with water and coat it, while damp, with
 a coating material conforming to 02210.30. Apply a minimum of two coats of coating material.
 Apply coating according to the manufacturer's instructions. The second coat may be applied
 any time after the previous coat, when touched lightly, does not adhere to the finger.
 Additional coats may be required to provide uniformity in coverage and color. Mortar sand
 may be added to the coating material to help achieve a uniform surface.
 (2) Penetrating Concrete Stain or Sealer - Select a penetrating concrete stain or sealer from
 the QPL. Apply stain or sealer to a dry concrete surface and according to the manufacturer's
 instructions. Ensure the concrete has cured sufficiently. Apply a minimum of two coats of
 stain or sealer. Additional coats may be required to provide uniformity in coverage and color.
 00540.54 Crack Inspection and Deck Sealing - Before allowing Public Traffic across the Bridge,
 the Engineer will inspect the deck and end panels for cracks.
 
 After correcting non-specification surface tolerance according to 00540.55 and after texturing the
 deck surface according to 00540.50(c), seal all visible cracks as follows:
 • In areas where cracks are 10 feet or more apart, seal each crack separately.
 • In areas where the cracks are numerous or are less than 10 feet apart, seal the entire area
 where the cracks occur.
 Seal with a low modulus concrete and crack sealer.
 Perform crack sealing Work at no additional cost to the Agency. Complete all crack sealing Work
 before opening to traffic. If the Bridge is opened to traffic at the Contractor's request before
 completing crack sealing, all additional traffic control to complete crack sealing will be at no
 additional cost to the Agency.
 00540.55 Final Acceptance of Bridge Deck Surface - Ensure the finished bridge deck roadway
 surface meets the tolerance specified in 00540.40(b)(3)(d) at every point. Furnish a 12-foot
 straightedge and use it under the Engineer's direction.
 
 Correct non-specification surface tolerances by complete removal and replacement or with a
 diamond grinder. If the surface is ground, take care not to unnecessarily sacrifice concrete cover
 458
 
 00540.90
 over the reinforcing bars. Restore transverse texture to specification tolerance. Perform correction
 Work, including required traffic control, at no additional cost to the Agency.

 00550.12 Acceptance of Concrete - Acceptance of concrete will be according to Section 00165
 and the following:
 (a) Aggregate - Acceptance of Aggregate will be based on the Contractor's quality control
 testing, if verified, according to Section 00165.
 (b) Plastic Concrete - Acceptance of plastic concrete will be based on tests performed by the
 QCT, according to Section 02001.
 (c) Hardened Concrete:
 (1) General - Acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on analysis of compressive
 strength test results of cylinders cast and cured by the Contractor and tested according to
 AASHTO T 22 by a CSTT at an ODOT certified laboratory and verified according to
 Section 00165.
 (2) Sampling and Testing - Obtain a sample from a delivery vehicle, selected at random,
 during placement in each bed. Test the sample for temperature, slump, density and air
 content and cast at least three cylinders for testing at 28 days. Cure the cylinders in a manner
 similar to the members they represent. Alternately, the cylinders may be cured in a curing
 chamber correlated in temperature with the concrete in the beds. Leave the cylinders in the
 bed with the member or in the curing chamber until the member is stripped. After the member
 is stripped, place the acceptance cylinders in storage in a moist condition according
 to AASHTO T 23.
 (3) Acceptance - Concrete members with an ASTV meeting or exceeding the specified
 design strength, ƒ'c, will be acceptable for strength. If the compressive strength of a single test
 specimen varies by more than 10 percent from the average of the other specimens, that
 compressive strength value will be discarded. The average compressive strength test of the
 remaining specimens will be the ASTV.
 
 If the ASTV is less than ƒ'c but at least 85 percent of 'c, the Engineer may review the results to
 determine if the member is suitable for the intended purpose. If suitable, the concrete
 represented by an ASTV less than ƒ'c may be accepted subject to a price adjustment
 according to 00150.25.
 Concrete that has an ASTV less than 85 percent of ƒ'c will not be accepted. All costs of
 removal, replacement, and all related Work is the Contractor's responsibility.
 Equipment
 00550.20 Prestressing Equipment - Provide hydraulic jacks equipped with calibrated pressure
 gauges. Calibrate the jack and gauge combination and furnish a graph or table showing the
 calibration to the Engineer.
 
 If other types of jacks are used, furnish calibrated proving rings or other devices that accurately
 indicate the jacking forces.
 
 465
 
 00550.25
 Recalibrate the jack and gauge combination annually or at any time the results are in question.
 00550.25 Vibrators - Provide either internal or external vibrators in working condition meeting the
 manufacturer's rating.
 
 When epoxy coated reinforcement is used, use internal vibrators fitted with a manufactured rubber
 head to minimize damage to the epoxy coating.
 Construction
 00550.40 Forming - Provide forms that are mortar-tight and sufficiently rigid to conform to the
 specified dimensions without appreciable distortion, warping or opening of joints.
 
 Before placing concrete in the forms, remove all dirt, sawdust, excess water and other foreign
 material.
 Tighten forms before depositing new concrete on or against hardened concrete.
 00550.41 Placing Reinforcement - Place reinforcement according to the Plans, Section 00530,
 and these Specifications.
 00550.42 Pretensioning:
 
 • Do not proceed with stressing prior to receiving the Engineer's approval of stressing
 calculations submitted according to 00550.02.
 • Provide a person, skilled in the use of the system of prestressing to be used, to supervise the
 Work and assist the Engineer.
 • Hold the prestressing strands accurately in position and stress by jacks meeting the
 requirements of 00550.20.
 • Determine the force induced in the strands by measurement of elongation and, independently,
 by direct measurement of force using a pressure gauge dynamometer and load cell. If the
 difference in force determination for the two methods exceeds 5 percent, determine the cause
 and correct it.
 • Measure strand elongation on the first and last strands stressed, and on at least 10 percent of
 the other strands in the bed.
 • Record the jacking forces and the elongations produced.
 • In single straight strand tensioning, and in a completely open bed with no headers or other
 possible sources of friction, loads indicated by the gauging system may be used.
 00550.43 Placing Concrete:
 (a) General - Place concrete so that the finished members are uniform and monolithic, free from
 cold joints.
 
 Do not deposit concrete in the forms until the Engineer has inspected and approved the
 placement of reinforcement, conduit, anchorages and prestressing steel.
 In preparation for placing concrete, prepare forms according to 00550.40. Remove struts, stays
 and braces serving temporarily to hold the forms in correct shape and alignment before the
 placing of concrete when the concrete placing has reached an elevation rendering them
 unnecessary. Remove these temporary members entirely from the forms and do not bury them in
 the concrete.
 466
 
 00550.45
 Place concrete close to its final position, without segregation of materials or displacement of the
 reinforcement.
 (b) Consolidation - Consolidate concrete, during and immediately after placing, by mechanical
 vibration as follows:
 
 • Operate vibrators at frequencies that produce consolidated placements.
 • Do not use vibration for shifting concrete to the extent of causing segregation.
 • Vibrate at points uniformly spaced and not further than twice the radius over which vibration
 is visibly effective.
 • Continue vibration until the concrete is thoroughly consolidated, but not until segregation
 occurs or localized areas of grout form.
 00550.44 Hot or Cold Weather - Produce and place concrete within the temperature range
 specified in 02001.20(d). When the air temperature is, or is expected to be, below 40 F or above
 100 F, observe the following precautions:
 
 • Do not place concrete on forms, reinforcing steel or appurtenances when the temperature of
 these facilities is below 40 F. Provide heat to maintain their temperature at 40 F minimum.
 • Do not place concrete when the form temperature is 100 F or more.
 00550.45 Curing - Cure members with low-pressure steam or radiant heat inside a suitable
 enclosure to contain the steam or heat, and minimize moisture and heat loss.
 (a) Curing Temperature - Measure cure temperature by one of the two following methods:
 (1) Measuring Enclosure Temperature:
 
 • Equip the enclosure with 24-hour recording thermometers at each end of each casting
 bed. Record the temperature for each thermometer on a single chart for each 24-hour
 period.
 • Do not allow the curing temperature within the enclosure to exceed 160 F. During the
 initial application of live steam or radiant heat, do not allow the temperature within the
 enclosure to increase at a rate exceeding 40 F per hour.
 (2) Measuring Concrete Temperature:
 
 • Embed a thermocouple 6 inches to 8 inches from the top or bottom of the member on its
 centerline and near its midpoint.
 • Record the concrete temperature with a calibrated recorder that provides a continuous
 record of time and temperature throughout the curing cycle.
 • Do not allow the concrete temperature to exceed 190 F. During the initial application of
 steam or radiant heat, do not allow the concrete temperature to increase at a rate
 exceeding 80 F per hour.
 (b) Curing with Low-Pressure Steam:
 
 • Make the initial application of steam after initial set of concrete as determined by
 AASHTO T 197 (ASTM C403).
 • Provide a steam supply line to the enclosure equipped with a motor-operated modulating
 steam control valve operated by a temperature-sensing element located in the enclosure.
 467
 
 00550.46
 • Provide steam at 100 percent relative humidity.
 • Do not apply steam directly on the concrete, form surfaces or test cylinders.
 • Distribute the steam within the enclosure through suitable ports located on each side of the
 units within the enclosure at not more than 30 foot centers to keep the units being cured
 completely and uniformly surrounded with steam.
 (c) Curing with Radiant Heat - Radiant heat may be applied to beds by means of pipes
 circulating steam, hot oil or hot water, by electric blankets or heating elements adjacent to forms,
 or by circulating warm air under and around forms. Do not allow pipes, blankets or heating
 elements to be in contact with concrete, form surfaces, or test cylinders.
 00550.46 Release of Prestress - Transfer bond stress to the concrete, or release end anchors,
 only when the concrete has attained the minimum compressive strength shown or specified for such
 transfer of load. Cut or release the elements according to the sequence shown on the reviewed
 Working Drawings so lateral eccentricity of prestress will be a minimum.
 
 Determine the compressive strength of the concrete to establish time for detensioning by testing
 standard cylinders cast and cured identically with the member. Cast and test cylinders used to
 determine release time according to AASHTO T 22 and AASHTO T 23.
 00550.47 Surface Finish - Apply the specified finish to each surface as shown or specified.
 
 Where no finish is shown or specified, provide a Class 1 surface finish to all exposed concrete
 surfaces, except on the tops of members, unless shown otherwise. For concrete surfaces that are
 not exposed, provide a general surface finish except on the tops of members. For surfaces
 receiving a Class 1 surface finish (ground and coated), finish the surfaces when the member is in its
 final position and finish to a point 1 foot below the finished ground line.
 Provide a roadway finish on the tops of members that do not have an asphalt concrete wearing
 surface. Provide a light broom finish on the tops of members that have an asphalt concrete wearing
 surface. After the concrete has been struck to grade and Cross Section, float it to produce a
 uniform surface. After the concrete has hardened sufficiently, texture it with a 1/8 inch wide steeltined tool that will mark the finished concrete to a depth of 1/8 inch to 3/16 inch. Space the
 markings 3/4 inch on centers. Do not overlap the texturing. Produce the texture transverse to the
 roadway centerline and full member width.
 (a) General Surface Finish - Apply a general surface finish as a final finish or preparatory to a
 higher class finish.
 
 Remove strands in members, except members with ends to be embedded in concrete, to a depth
 of 1 inch from the face of the concrete and point up the resulting holes flush with the end of the
 member with an epoxy grout from the QPL.
 Remove all metal form bolts, snap ties and any other metal to a depth of 1 inch below the finished
 concrete surface. Repair air pockets over 1/2 inch in depth, all form tie removals, Rock pockets
 and unsound concrete, and fill resulting holes or depressions with concrete or PCC repair
 material. On exposed surfaces, correct all bulges, fins, depressions, repairs, stains or
 discolorations to produce a smooth surface with uniform texture, lines, and appearance.
 The Engineer will determine the extent of required repairs.
 (b) Class 1 Surface Finish (Ground and Coated) - After completion of the general surface
 finish:
 
 468
 
 00550.49
 • Grind the surface with a power grinder or other equal method to remove all laitance and
 surface film.
 • Thoroughly saturate the surface with water and coat while damp with a coating material
 conforming to 02210.30.
 • Apply a minimum of two coats of coating material. The second coat may be applied at any
 time after the previous coat does not adhere to the finger. Apply additional coats as
 required to provide uniformity in coverage and color.
 • Mortar sand may be added to the coating material to achieve a uniform surface.
 00550.48 Exposed Reinforcement - After a member is removed from the casting bed, clean any
 projecting reinforcement of dirt, oil, grease, rust and corrosives and protect it from damage until
 concrete is cast around it.
 00550.49 Lifting, Storing, Transporting, Erecting, and Bracing - Be responsible for the safety of
 precast members during all stages of construction. Include lifting and storage details on the
 Working Drawings for all precast members. Lifting, storage, transporting, erecting, and bracing
 details will not be reviewed by the Engineer. Lifting, storage, transporting, erecting and bracing of
 members is the sole responsibility of the Contractor subject to the following requirements:
 (a) Lifting:
 
 • Lift members so as to prevent damage.
 • Lift members at the support points specified by the manufacturer.
 • Lift members in a manner that does not cause damaging bending or torsional forces.
 • Members will be rejected if not handled correctly as specified.
 (b) Storing - Store members with support points that are level transversely.
 (c) Transporting - Transport members from the casting yard not less than 7 Calendar Days after
 casting, not less than 7 days after all concrete patching and repairing is complete and after 28Day compressive strengths have been achieved.
 
 • Temporary prestress strands may be added to precast concrete members for the purpose of
 controlling concrete stresses during transportation. Detension these strands after the
 members are set in the field and prior to establishing grades for the bottom of deck forms.
 • Temporary strands may be either post-tensioned or pretensioned in the fabrication yard.
 Debond post-tensioned strands completely from end to end. Debond pretensioned strands
 completely from end to end except for a length at the end of the beam equal to the
 development length of the strand, but not more than 10 feet. Pretensioned strands may be
 used for simple span girders only.
 • The stress from temporary strands may be transferred to the concrete member only after
 the stress from the permanent strands has been transferred to the concrete member. This
 requirement may be waived for pretensioned strands if calculations are submitted, and
 approved by the Engineer, that show acceptable stress levels in the member.
 • For pretensioned temporary strands, form a hole in the girder at mid span or at each end of
 the debonded length, so the strand can be cut for detensioning. Ensure these holes are
 free-draining and patched after detensioning. The detensioned strands may be left in place.
 • Post-tensioned temporary strands may be placed in a conduit or debonded full length with
 direct contact sheathing. In either case, patch the holes formed by the conduit or sheathing
 to a depth of 1 1/2 inch, after the removal of the conduit or sheathing to this same depth.
 The detensioned strands may be left in place.
 469
 
 00550.50
 • Submit stamped calculations that predict the effect of temporary strands on initial and long
 term girder Camber according to 00150.35.
 Damaged members will be rejected. Replace damaged members, or if allowed by the Engineer,
 repair damaged members to the Engineer's satisfaction at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (d) Erecting and Bracing - After a member has been erected and until it is secured to the
 Structure, provide temporary bracing as necessary to resist wind or other loads. Provide the
 Engineer with an erection plan and bracing details at least 2 days prior to erecting girders.
 Bracing details are not necessary for side-by-side slab and box beam construction.
 00550.50 Tie Rods - Furnish tie rods according to the Plans and Section 02560. Install as follows:
 
 • Clean and lubricate tie rods and nuts before installation.
 • Lubricate galvanized tie rods and nuts with a lubricant from the QPL containing dye that visibly
 contrasts with the color of galvanizing or coating.
 • Install compressible washer type direct tension indicators under the turned nuts and tighten the
 nuts as recommended by the manufacturer until the gaps in the indicators are nil or as shown.
 A nil gap is defined as a gap when the number of spaces between the protrusions of a direct
 tension indicator in which the 0.005 inch feeler gauge is refused at each tie rod equals or
 exceeds 2, 3, 3, 4, or 4, when the number of spaces between protrusions in the direct tension
 indicator are 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, respectively, and a visible gap exists in at least one space.
 00550.51 Keyway Grouting for Slabs, Box Beams, and Integral Deck Members - After forms
 have been removed from slabs, box beams and integral deck bulb tees, sandblast all keyways to
 remove residual form oil and any other foreign material. After the members are in place and the tie
 rods are tensioned (for slabs and box beams) or welded connections are made (integral deck bulb
 tee girders), clean the keyways of all foreign material and keep moist for 24 hours before grouting.
 For slabs and box beams, after the tie rods are tensioned, seal the space remaining at the bottom of
 the keyways with a backer rod as shown before grouting.
 
 Do not pour keyway grout unless the air temperature is above 45 F and at or below the maximum
 air temperature recommended by the manufacturer. Water cure grout for the period of time
 indicated by the manufacturer.
 00550.52 Poured Joint Filler for Integral Deck Members with AC Wearing Surface - After grout
 is poured to the level of the keyway shown for slabs and box beams, remove loose grout, and other
 foreign material from exposed keyway walls. After keyway grout is fully cured, dry surfaces to be
 sealed immediately before installing poured joint filler.
 
 Install poured joint filler according to the manufacturer's directions. Cure the filler sufficiently to
 resist the pressures and temperatures of the paving operation before the wearing surface is placed.
 00550.53 Differential Camber Correction for Integral Deck Members with No Asphalt
 Concrete Wearing Surface - Correct differential Camber between adjacent slabs, box beams or
 integral deck bulb tees in a span (measured in place at the site) if the variance between adjacent
 members or stages is 1/2 inch or more at any place along the top edge corners.
 
 Equalize the Camber differences by either patching with an epoxy or non-epoxy grout or other
 approved method, at no additional cost to the Agency. Before patching, clean the area by
 sandblasting. Water cure the patch for the period of time indicated by the manufacturer. If patching
 is used, slope it away from the joint on a 1V:6H Slope or flatter.

 00555.41 Ducts - Provide ducts for post-tensioning tendons according to the following:
 (a) General - Make ducts mortar-tight and place them accurately at the locations shown or as
 directed. Provide positive, metallic, mortar-tight connection joints between sections of rigid duct
 which do not permit angle changes at the joints. Use waterproof tape at connections.
 (b) Vents - Provide vents in all ducts within plus or minus 3 feet of high and low points, and other
 locations shown. Make vents of 3/4-inch nominal diameter standard PVC, galvanized steel or
 copper pipe. Make connections to ducts with compatible structural fasteners. Make the vents
 mortar-tight, tape as necessary, and provide means for injecting grout through the vents and for
 sealing the vents. Securely fasten ducts and vents in place to prevent movement. After grouting,
 remove the ends of vents to provide 2 inches of cover to the nearest concrete surface.
 (c) Repair - Before placing concrete, repair all holes or openings in the ducts. Holes less
 than 1/4 inch may be repaired by several wraps of waterproof tape. Repair holes larger
 than 1/4 inch with a split metal sleeve which overlaps itself by 3 inches, extends at least 3 inches
 on either side of the hole, is sealed with waterproof tape, and is secured to the duct. Cut out
 indentations which cannot be repaired and repair as above for holes larger than 1/4 inch.
 (d) Maintenance - After installing ducts, keep the ends covered at all times in a manner that
 prevents entry of moisture or debris. If the surrounding temperature is below 32 F, keep the
 ducts free of water to avoid damage due to freezing.
 
 Before placing forms for the decks of box girder cells, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer that all ducts are unobstructed.
 Clean all ducts and remove accumulated water at the time of placing stressing steel.
 00555.42 Stressing:
 (a) General - Do not make welds, or grounds for welding Equipment, on the forms or on the steel
 in the member after any stressing steel has been installed.
 
 Protect stressing steel against physical damage and rust or other corrosion at all times until
 grouted. A corrosion inhibitor may be used. Stressing steel that has sustained physical damage,
 detrimental rust, pitting or other results of corrosion at any time will be rejected. Stressing steel
 
 475
 
 00555.42
 with only light rust is acceptable if rust spots can be removed by rubbing or scraping with the
 fingernail and only light streaks of rust remain.
 Tension stressing steel by means of hydraulic jacks so that the force in the stressing steel is not
 less than the value shown.
 (b) Duct Alignment - Provide a duct alignment according to the approved Working Drawings to
 the follow tolerances:
 
 • Horizontal Alignment -  1/4 inch unless shown otherwise
 • Vertical Alignment -  3/8 inch
 (c) Timing - Do not stress members until at least 14 days, excluding days when the surrounding
 temperature is below 40 F for a total of 4 hours or more, after the last concrete has been placed
 in the member and not until all the concrete has reached the specified compressive strength.
 
 Subject to prior written approval, a portion of the total stressing force may be applied to a member
 when the concrete compressive strength in the member is less than the value shown. Approval
 of such partial stressing will in no way relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for successfully
 constructing the member.
 (d) Procedures - Tension stressing steel by jacking at each end of the tendon unless otherwise
 noted.
 (1) Continuous Span Members - Jacking of both ends need not be done simultaneously.
 (2) Simple Span Members - When jacking from one end only is allowed, tension half of the
 stressing steel in each member from one end of the span and the other half from the opposite
 end, unless otherwise allowed in writing.
 (3) Bent Cap Members - Subject to prior written approval, bent cap stressing steel may be
 tensioned by jacking from one end only.
 (e) Measuring Prestressing Force - Conduct tensioning so the tension being applied and the
 elongation of the stressing steel may be measured at any time. Keep a record of gauge
 pressures, load cell reading and elongations. Furnish a copy of the record to the Engineer when
 requested.
 
 Determine prestressing force by both of the following methods:
 (1) Measurement of Strand Elongation - Determine required elongation from average
 load-elongation curves for prestressing strand used.
 (2) Observation of Jacking Force - Observe jacking force on a calibrated gauge or load cell
 or by use of a calibrated dynamometer.
 
 Ascertain the cause of any difference in force determination between (1) and (2) that
 exceeds 5 percent and correct the condition causing the discrepancy.
 (f) Post-Stressing Survey - Conduct a visual survey of all surfaces of all stressed concrete
 elements immediately after tensioning is complete. Search for cracking, distress, or other
 abnormalities and report findings to the Engineer. Obtain Engineer approval of the post-stressing
 survey before cutting strand ends.
 
 476
 
 00555.43
 00555.43 Bonding and Grouting - Bond stressing steel to the concrete by filling the void space
 between the duct and the tendon with tendon grout consistent with the approved trial batch.
 Complete grouting each tendon within 14 Calendar Days after placing it. If projects are within
 25 aerial miles of the Pacific Ocean, complete grouting each tendon within 7 Calendar Days after
 placing it. Test grout according to ASTM C939, as modified in 00555.13(a) at the start of grout
 production, at least every 2 hours after the start of grout production, and as requested by the
 Engineer, to verify that flow characteristics of the grout remain within the tolerances specified
 in 00555.13(a). Perform Mud Balance tests for each batch according to 00555.13(c). Compare and
 document the wet density value with the value obtained during the trial batch. If the values differ by
 more than 3 percent, rerun ASTM C939 as modified in 00555.13(a) for continued compliance.
 
 Perform compressive strength tests according to 00555.13(d) at least once daily and provide the
 test results to the Engineer for 7 and 28-Day testing.
 Perform bleed resistance tests at the mixer location according to 00555.13(b) at least once daily.
 (a) Pre-Grouting Procedure - Cut stressing steel 1 inch beyond wedges or anchor nuts after
 stressing operations.
 (b) Grouting Operation - Provide a standby flushing system and demonstrate that it is readily
 accessible and operable should it become necessary to flush out a partially grouted tendon.
 
 Do not retemper grout. Continuously agitate grout until it is pumped.
 (c) Grouting Procedure - Make all ducts clean and free of deleterious materials. Blow out each
 duct thoroughly with oil-free air immediately before grouting. Ducts may be flushed with water
 immediately before grouting if approved.
 
 Fit grout injection pipes with positive mechanical shutoff valves. Fit vent and ejection pipes with
 grout-tight caps, valves or other mechanical closing devices.
 Grout from the low end of the Structure.
 Keep the temperature of the concrete surrounding the duct at 35 F or higher at the time of
 grouting and until job-cured grout cubes reach 800 psi compressive strength.
 Maintain grout temperatures between 50 F and 90 F during mixing and pumping. If necessary,
 cool the mixing water.
 Open all vents when grouting starts. Allow grout to flow from the first vent until residual flushing
 water or entrapped air is removed, then close the vent. Close remaining vents in sequence in the
 same manner.
 Pump thixotropic grouts with 75 psi pressure or less between outlets. Reduce the pumping
 pressure to 5 psi while passing intermediate outlets or approaching the end of the tendon.
 Maintain pressure at 5 psi for 15 seconds after each outlet is reached. Resume 75 psi pressure
 between intermediate outlets after an outlet is closed off. Allow effluent bleed at tendon end
 using 5 psi pressure.
 Whenever the grout pumping pressure exceeds 100 psi:
 • Inject grout at any other vent which has been, or is ready to be, closed as long as a
 one-way flow of grout is maintained. If this procedure is used, fit the vent used for injection
 with a mechanical shutoff valve.
 
 477
 
 00555.80
 • If the one-way flow of grout cannot be maintained, immediately flush the grout out of the
 duct with water.
 Pump grout through the duct and continuously waste it at the outlet vent until:
 • No visible slugs of water or air are ejected.
 • The afflux time of the grout at the mixer during the grouting process is not more
 than 5 seconds different from the efflux time at the mixer during the initial measurements of
 the flow cone test during the trial batch, and is between 5 and 30 seconds.
 • The efflux time of the ejected grout is not more than 5 seconds different from the efflux time
 at the mixer.
 Do not over-mix the grout.
 Close the outlet vent and maintain the pumping pressure or 60 psi, whichever is greater, for at
 least 30 seconds; then close the valve at the injection pipe while maintaining this pressure. Do
 not open valves or vents until the grout sets.
 (d) Anchorage Encasement - Following grouting, encase grout caps and fill all grouting and
 post tensioning blockouts with concrete and finish flush. Prepare post tensioning blockouts
 according to 00540.43(a) or as approved. Apply an epoxy bonding agent from the QPL to
 exposed bearing plate and wedge plate surfaces prior to placing concrete in the blockouts.
 Measurement
 00555.80 Measurement - No measurement of quantities will be made for Work performed under
 this Section. Estimated quantities of materials will be listed in the Special Provisions.
 Payment
 00555.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of Work performed under this Section will be paid for
 at the Contract lump sum amount for the item "Post-Tensioning".
 
 Payment will be payment in full for furnishing and placing all Materials, and for furnishing all
 Equipment, labor, and Incidentals necessary to complete the Work as specified.
 No separate or additional payment will be made for anchorage devices, ducts, tendons, prestressing
 steel, grout, and admixtures, or for preparation and testing of grout.

 487
 
 00559.17
 00559.17 Acceptance of Concrete - Acceptance of concrete will be according to Section 00165
 and the following:
 (a) Aggregate - Acceptance will be based on the Contractor's quality control testing, if verified,
 according to Section 00165.
 (1) Aggregate Gradation - A stockpile contains specification Aggregate gradation when the
 quality level for each sieve size calculated according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than
 the quality level shown in Table 00165-2 for a PF of 1.00. Each required sample represents a
 sublot. When the quality level shown in Table 00165-2 yields a PF of less than 1.00 for any
 constituent, the material is non-specification.
 (2) Non-specification Aggregate Gradation - Stockpiled Aggregates that contain
 non-specification Aggregate gradation will be rejected by the Engineer unless non-specification
 material is removed from the stockpile. Do not add additional material to the stockpile until
 enough non-specification material is removed so that the quality level for each constituent is
 equal to or greater than the quality level shown in Table 00165-2 for a 1.00 PF.
 (b) Plastic Concrete - Acceptance of the plastic concrete will be based on the tests performed
 by the Contractor's QCT, according to the tolerances and limits for water/cementitious ratio,
 slump, air entrainment, and temperature of 00559.14
 (c) Hardened Concrete - Acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on one set of three
 cylinders cast from each 50 cubic yards of concrete placed. Cast a minimum of one set per
 production shift. Cast and cure the test specimens according to AASHTO T 23 in 4 x 8 inch
 single-use plastic molds and test at 7 days according to AASHTO T 22.
 (1) General - For all SFC and LMC, acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on an
 analysis of compressive strength tests of cylinders cast by the QCT. Test the cylinders at an
 Agency certified laboratory.
 (2) Actual 7 Day Strength Test Value - The Actual 7 Day Strength Test Value (ASTV) is the
 average compressive strength of the three cylinders tested. If the compressive strength of a
 single test specimen varies by more than 10 percent from the average of the other two
 specimens, that compressive strength value will be discarded. The average compressive
 strength test of the two remaining specimens will be the ASTV.
 (3) Acceptance - Hardened concrete with an ASTV meeting or exceeding the specified
 design strength, 'c will be accepted for strength. If the ASTV is less than 'c but at
 least 85 percent of 'c, the Engineer may review the results to determine if the concrete
 represented by the cylinders is suitable for the intended purpose. Remove concrete that has
 an ASTV less than 85 percent of 'c unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Engineer. If
 the concrete is removed, the cost of removal, replacement and all related Work shall be the
 Contractor's responsibility. If the Engineer determines that the concrete is suitable for the
 intended purpose, the concrete may be allowed to remain in place, subject to a price
 adjustment according to 00150.25.
 
 If an ASTV falls below ƒ'c, the Contractor may submit a written plan outlining a proposed
 alternate method of evaluating compressive strength. Submit the plan for review by the
 Engineer within 3 days of the test. Provide evidence that a reasonable 'cr (over-design) was
 maintained and that there is credible evidence (besides low strength) which warrants
 consideration of this option. The Engineer may allow an alternate method of acceptance if the
 compressive strength test results are determined to be suspect from definable external factors.
 
 488
 
 00559.21
 (d) Surface Tolerance - The finished surface, when tested with a 12-foot straightedge, shall not
 vary by more than 1/8 inch. Furnish the straightedge and operate it under the direction of the
 Engineer.
 
 If the concrete surface does not meet the surface tolerance, stop the operation until revised
 methods, changes in Equipment, or correction of procedures are proposed and approved.
 Correct all non-specification surface tolerance after curing and before texturing with a
 self-propelled diamond grinder. Correct the surface tolerances before opening the Roadway to
 traffic at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (e) Bond Strength - Perform two bond tests for each placement in the presence of and at
 locations designated by the Engineer within 28 Calendar Days of overlay placement and before
 opening the Roadway to traffic. Cut 3 inch diameter cores and conduct bond tests on the cores.
 
 The bond tests consist of:
 • Coring through the overlay and approximately 1 inch into the existing concrete.
 • Attaching a device to the top of the core.
 • Exerting a tensile load to the core sufficient to cause failure or achieve 300 psi, whichever
 occurs first.
 A successful test is the failure of the concrete substrate or bond failure at or above 175 psi.
 After coring and testing, restore the area voided by the cores by blowing with compressed air and
 filling with an approved PCC repair material.

 00559.42 Placing:
 (a) Mixing and Delivering Silica Fume Concrete - Mix SFC in either batch plant mixers or truck
 mixers as the Contractor elects. Add the silica fume at the time recommended by the CCT.
 (1) Batch Plant Mixing - Mix and deliver SFC in batches no larger than 8 cubic yards. Mix
 according to ASTM C94 but not less than 120 seconds.
 Mix at the mixing speed
 recommended by the mixer manufacturer beginning after all materials, including water, are in
 the mixer.
 (2) Truck Mixing - Mix and deliver SFC to the jobsite in batches no larger than 63 percent of
 the drum volume.
 Before leaving the batch plant, mix the batch for not less
 than 100 revolutions at the rate of rotation recommended by the mixer manufacturer.
 (3) Jobsite Adjustments - Air content and slump may be adjusted at the jobsite to meet
 specification limits with the addition of chemical admixtures according to CCT instructions.
 After addition of chemical admixtures, mix the load for a minimum of 30 revolutions at mixing
 speed.
 (4) Delivery - Deliver, discharge, and place SFC in final position before the allowable mix
 temperature is exceeded, within 90 minutes of initial mixing and before the total revolutions of
 the mixer drum have not exceeded 300 revolutions.
 (b) Mixing and Delivering Latex Modified Concrete - Mix and deliver LMC with mobile mixers.
 (c) Placement Conditions - Place SFC and LMC on prepared surfaces only when all of the
 following conditions exist:
 
 • The combination of air temperature, relative humidity, concrete temperature, and wind
 velocity produces an evaporation rate of less than 0.10 pounds per square foot of surface
 area per hour according to Figure 00540-1.
 • The surface temperature of the prepared deck is 40 F or greater and less than 80 F. The
 surface temperature is rising if it is between 40 F and 45 F. In the presence of the
 Engineer, measure the surface temperature with an infra-red thermometer at a minimum of
 three locations on the deck.
 • The air temperature is at least 40 °F at the start of and during placement of concrete. Do
 not place concrete if the air temperature is, or is forecast to be, below 40 °F the Day of
 placement or is forecast to be below 40 °F on any of the next 7 Calendar Days after
 placement unless a Cold Weather Plan has been approved by the Engineer.
 • If precipitation is not forecast between 2 hours before and 2 hours after the scheduled
 placement duration. An acceptable forecast will have less than 30 percent chance of
 precipitation for the entire placement window. Provide a forecast to the Engineer 1 hour
 before placement.
 • During the hours of darkness, work areas are illuminated. Submit an illumination plan for
 approval at the preplacement conference.
 To place concrete when the temperature is below 40 °F, submit a Cold Weather Plan that
 identifies the methods that will be used to prevent the concrete temperature from falling
 below 50 °F. Methods include heated enclosures and insulated forms. Also include in the plan
 measures that will be taken if the concrete temperature falls below 50 °F. Provide a 24 hour
 continuous recording thermometer to verify the concrete temperature. Do not place concrete until
 the Cold Weather Plan is approved.
 
 494
 
 00559.42
 (d) Thickness - Place SFC and LMC with a minimum thickness of 1 1/2 inches, as shown.
 (e) Construction Limitations - Place SFC and LMC against a firmly fixed bulkhead. Control
 sagging or running of freshly placed SFC and LMC in areas of steep gradient by one or both of
 the following methods:
 
 • Modifying direction or method of placement
 • Modifying slump
 Except when allowed, keep traffic off the lane adjacent to a placement for at least 4 hours after
 the placement is completed. When allowed, slow traffic by flagging for at least 4 hours after
 completion of the pour. In both cases, the Engineer may increase the time limits due to weather
 or traffic conditions.
 (f) Placement Procedures - Furnish at least two transverse work Bridges, not counting the
 finishing machine for SFC and LMC.
 (1) Preceding Placement - Each Day before placing concrete operate the finishing machine,
 in the presence of the Engineer, over the deck to check that the required thickness of concrete
 overlay will be achieved. Place concrete working up-grade, unless otherwise approved.
 (2) Joints - At transverse and longitudinal joints, saw cut the section previously placed to form
 a straight, vertical edge before placing any adjacent sections. Saw cutting joints may be
 omitted if the bulkhead produces a straight, smooth, vertical surface. On both saw cut and
 formed joints remove all loose material by sand blasting or water blasting the face of the joints.
 a. Longitudinal Joint - A longitudinal construction joint will be allowed only at the
 centerline of the Roadway or at lane lines unless otherwise shown or directed.
 b. Transverse Joint - When placement operation is delayed by 1/2 hour or more, form a
 construction joint by removing all material not up to finish grade, in a straight line.
 (3) Placing:
 a. Silica Fume Concrete - After the deck surface has been cleaned and immediately
 before resurfacing, broom a thin coat of grout onto the prepared deck. Ensure that all parts
 of the prepared deck receive a vigorous brooming that scrubs the grout into the deck
 surface and results in an even coat with no excess grout collecting in pockets. Grout
 placement shall not extend more than 15 feet ahead of the SFC being placed. Grout shall
 be a mixture of water and cement with a w/c ratio of between 0.45 and 0.50. Broom the
 grout at a rate to prevent drying before being covered by the SFC. If the grout does dry,
 stop the overlay, remove the dried grout, clean and prepare the affected area of the deck,
 and reapply grout according to this subsection.
 b. Latex Modified Concrete - After the deck surface has been cleaned and before
 resurfacing, scrub a slurry latex, cement, and water onto the prepared deck. Scrub slurry at
 a rate so that it does not become dry before being covered by LMC. If the slurry does dry,
 stop the overlay and re-clean and re-prepare the affected area of the deck.
 
 Stop all placement operations if it starts to rain. Protect fresh previously placed concrete
 from rain. The Engineer may order removal of all concrete damaged by rain.
 (4) Roadway Finish - After the deck has been struck off with a finishing machine, mist the
 surface horizontally with water and float it, if necessary, to produce a smooth, uniform, sealed
 surface. Do not spray water directly on the freshly placed concrete and do not allow water to
 
 495
 
 00559.42
 puddle or pond. Hand finishing may be required along edges of concrete placement. Use
 a 12-foot straightedge during placement to verify deck grades and to correct defects in hand
 finished areas.
 (5) Curing - Cure SFC and LMC by doing the following:
 
 • Provide wind breaks or other approved methods when exposed to conditions which may
 cause premature drying during placement operations. Premature drying is defined as an
 evaporation rate equal to or greater than 0.10 pounds per square foot per hour, as
 determined from Figure 00540-1, or as the loss of surface sheen.
 • For curing applications

 according
 
 • Provide power washers fitted with fog nozzles and apply a fog spray upwind of the
 concrete placement after finishing according to 00540.28. Do not allow larger water
 droplets that drip from nozzles to fall onto the freshly finished plastic concrete.
 • Cover the concrete with a single layer of clean initial covering immediately after finishing.
 Apply initial covering no later than 20 minutes after final Pass of the finishing machine
 and no greater than 20 feet from the back of the finishing machine. Provide an initial
 covering with a minimum length sufficient to cover the bridge deck from side to side of the
 concrete placement. Use one of the following:
 • Saturated wet burlap having a minimum dry weight of 10 ounces per yard for material
 40 inches wide. Presoak the burlap by immersing it completely in water for 72 hours
 prior to the concrete placement and presoak new burlap with a wetting agent. Overlap
 the edges at least 6 inches.
 • Nonwoven, needle punched polypropylene fabric curing blanket from the QPL.
 Thoroughly wet fabric within 15 minutes of fabric placement. Overlap the edges at
 least 12 inches.
 • Provide soaker hoses for additional soaking of the initial covering. Place over the full
 width of the concrete placement, at a maximum of 10 foot intervals. Do not allow initial
 wetting of burlap or fabric to dry before soaker hoses are in place and operational.
 Operate soaker hoses continuously to keep the initial covering saturated at all times.
 • Place a layer of 4 mil polyethylene film over the initial covering and soaker hoses.
 Provide clear or white polyethylene film if the air temperature is forecasted to be above
 65 °F within 24 hours of the concrete placement, and black at other times, as determined
 by the Engineer. Overlap the edges of polyethylene film by 12 inches. Keep the film in
 place by taping and weighting the edges where they overlap or are vulnerable to
 movement by wind. Once a particular type of film has been placed, do not change it
 during the curing period.
 Wet cure SFC surfaces for 7 Calendar Days.
 Wet cure LMC surfaces for 36 hours then air cure LMC a minimum additional 60 hours.
 Extend the air cure time period by the number of hours that the surface is wet from either rain
 or other sources but no more than120 hours from time of placement.
 If during the curing time, the temperature on the 24-hour recording thermometer falls below
 45 F, extend the cure time by the number of hours the temperature is below 45 F.
 (6) Saw Cut Texturing - Texture the concrete according to 00540.50(c) after wet curing
 surfaces for 7 Calendar Days.

 00559.43 Delamination and Crack Inspection:
 (a) Delamination Inspection and Repair - The surface will be inspected by the Engineer for
 delamination, bond failure, or other damage by use of a chain drag, coring, or other devices.
 
 Repair all delaminated areas of 1 square foot or greater.
 Delaminated areas of less
 than 1 square foot will not require repair. Core samples that do not achieve a bond strength of at
 least 175 psi will be at no additional cost to the Agency. Core samples with a bond strength
 of 175 psi or greater will be paid according to 00195.20.
 (b) Crack Inspection and Sealing- The surface will be inspected by the Engineer for cracks.
 
 After correcting non-specification surface tolerances and after texturing the deck surface, seal all
 visible cracks as follows:
 • In areas where cracks are 10 feet or more apart, seal each crack separately.
 • In areas where the cracks are numerous or are less than 10 feet apart, seal the entire area
 where the cracks occur.
 Seal with a low modulus concrete and crack sealer.
 Perform all repair and sealing Work at no additional cost to the Agency. Complete all repair and
 sealing Work before opening to traffic. If the Bridge is opened to traffic at the Contractor's request
 before completing repair Work, all additional traffic control to complete the repair Work will be at no
 additional cost to the Agency.

 Shop Fabrication
 00560.20 Notice of Work - Give the Engineer at least 14 Calendar Days' notice of the beginning of
 Work at the mill, when directed, or at the shop, so inspection may be provided. The term "mill"
 means any rolling mill or foundry where material for the Work is to be manufactured. Do not
 fabricate material, or perform Work at the mill or shop, before the Engineer has been notified.
 00560.21 Fabrication Inspection Expense - If fabrication of structural steel outside of the State of
 Oregon creates additional mill, shop, and plant inspection expenses for the Agency, the Contractor's
 payment for structural steel Structures will be reduced according to 00165.91.
 00560.22 Test Results Certificate and Steel Identification:
 (a) Test Results Certificate and Initial Identification - Furnish test results certificates, showing
 chemical analysis and physical tests for each heat or plate of steel, for all members according
 to 00165.35 and Section 02530. Identify each piece of steel to be fabricated.
 
 Identify on Working Drawings each piece to be made of steel other than AASHTO M 270
 (ASTM A709), Grade 36 steel. Give pieces made of different grades of steel different assembling
 or erecting marks, even though they are of identical dimensions and detail.
 Provide a system of marking individual pieces made of steel, other than AASHTO M 270
 (ASTM A709), Grade 36, and issue cutting instructions to the shop (generally by
 499
 
 00560.22
 cross-referencing the assembly marks on the Working Drawings with the corresponding item on
 the mill purchase order) that maintain identity of the heat number.
 Material that can be identified by heat number and mill test report may be furnished from stock.
 Mark any unmarked excess material placed in stock for later use with the heat number and with
 its AASHTO M 160 (ASTM A6) specification identification color code.
 (b) Steel Identification during Fabrication - During fabrication, and until member assembly,
 each piece of steel, other than AASHTO M 270 (ASTM A709), Grade 36 steel, shall show clearly
 and legibly its specification identification color code shown in AASHTO M 160 (ASTM A6).
 
 Individually marked pieces of steel used in furnished size, or reduced from furnished size, may be
 used only if end or edge trim does not disturb the heat number or color code. Any usable piece
 may be used without further color coding providing the heat number or color code remains
 legible.
 Mark individual pieces, other than AASHTO M 270 (ASTM A709), Grade 36, with the
 AASHTO M 160 (ASTM A6) specification identification color code before cutting to a smaller size.
 Mark individual pieces of steel, other than AASHTO M 270 (ASTM A709), Grade 36 steel, which
 are furnished in tagged lifts or bundles with the AASHTO M 160 (ASTM A6) specification
 identification color code immediately on being removed from the bundle or lift.
 Pieces of steel, other than AASHTO M 270 (ASTM A709), Grade 36 steel, which before
 assembling into members, will be subject to fabricating operations such as heating, blast
 cleaning, galvanizing or other coating that might obliterate paint color code marking, shall be
 marked for grade by steel die stamping or by a substantial tag firmly attached. Use only rounded
 characters when primary stress components are identified by steel die stamping. Impressions
 shall have a maximum allowable depth of 0.010 inch and shall be placed a minimum distance
 of 2 inches from edges of tension-stressed plate members. Characters shall be 1/4 inch
 to 3/8 inch high and shall have a minimum face radius of 0.015 inch.
 (c) Check Samples - To verify the accuracy of test reports, obtain check samples from material
 furnished for fabrication. The plates, shapes or bars from which check samples are required will
 be as designated on the Plans, and shall be ordered from the mill with the extra size required for
 samples. The Engineer may take additional samples from drop-offs or scrap material as deemed
 necessary. No more than two samples will be required from any one plate according to
 AASHTO M 270 (ASTM A709) Grade 36, 50, HPS 50W and HPS 70 W with QT processing, or
 from any one shape or bar. Remove material for check samples in the presence of the Engineer.
 The Engineer will select the locations where samples are to be taken. Check samples may be
 ordered cut from either end of the designated steel plate, according to AASHTO M 270
 (ASTM A709) Grade 36, 50, HPS 50W and HPS 70 W with QT processing, or shape or bar. To
 verify accuracy of test reports for HPS 50W and HPS 70W with thermo-mechanical control
 process, check samples of both ends of each plate is required.
 
 Check samples in plates shall be rectangular, not less than 24 inches long in the required
 direction, depending on plate width, for the longitudinal axis of tensile specimens, and 5 inches
 wide. Bend specimens, where required, shall be not less than 24 inches long in the direction of
 rolling of the plate. Check samples in bars or shapes shall be the full section and at least
 24 inches long. In removing the sample, take care not to damage it by overheating. The Agency
 will be responsible for the necessary machining of check test specimens and their testing. To
 expedite obtaining test results, the Contractor may, if approved, perform machining and testing of
 specimens, in the presence of the Engineer.
 
 500
 
 00560.24
 The normal basis of acceptance of material will be the mill report or other test report, and
 fabrication need not be held up pending results of check tests. If the check tests indicate material
 with properties failing to meet the minimum requirements of the material specification, the
 material may be rejected and the Contractor required to order new material at no additional cost
 to the Agency.
 For purposes of determining compliance with these Specifications, if the results on an original
 tensile specimen are within 2,000 psi of the required tensile strength, within 1,000 psi of the
 required yield point, or within 2 percent of the required elongation, a retest will be allowed on two
 random specimens from the heat or lot. If the results from both of these retest specimens meet
 Specifications, the heat or lot will be accepted. The specimens shall be oriented with the final
 direction of rolling in the same manner as the original specimen, and may come from any location
 within the plate. The extra material from plates, shapes or bars that is not used for check testing
 shall become the property of the Contractor.
 (d) Certification of Identification - Upon request, furnish an affidavit certifying that throughout
 the fabrication operation the identification of steel has been maintained according to this
 Specification.
 00560.23 Shop Inspection and Testing:
 (a) Facilities - Furnish facilities for the inspection of material and Work in the mill and shop.
 Allow the Engineer free access to the material and Work for inspection.
 (b) Testing - Furnish samples for testing as specified according to Section 00165.
 (c) Rejections - The Inspector's inspection at the mill or shop of any material, Work or finished
 members will not prevent their subsequent rejection, if later found damaged or defective, nor
 relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to correct or replace the Work at no additional cost to
 the Agency.
 (d) Transport - Ship no member or piece of fabricated steel without the Inspectors' label or
 marking.
 00560.24 Transporting to, Handling and Storage at Shop - In transporting, handling, and storing
 the steel Work at the shop, avoid bending, scraping, or overstressing the pieces. Reject pieces bent
 or otherwise damaged. In addition:
 
 • Conduct the loading, transporting and unloading of pieces so the metal remains clean.
 • Keep materials free from dirt, oil or other contaminants, and protect from corrosion.
 • If pieces are shop-painted, handle with slings or other means that will not damage coating
 system.
 • Handle and store girders and beams upright, and shore.
 • Support and handle members so Camber is maintained.
 • Support long members, such as columns and chords, on skids placed near enough together to
 prevent damage from deflection.
 • Store materials on platforms, skids or other supports above ground and high water elevations
 and slightly pitch all trough sections that might retain water to provide drainage.

 than 1/16 inch. Ream any holes that are required to be enlarged to admit the bolts. Make clean
 cut holes without torn or ragged edges. Poor matching of holes will be cause for rejection.
 (b) Drilled or Reamed Holes - Assemble and securely hold connecting parts requiring drilled or
 reamed holes. Match-mark connecting parts before disassembling.
 
 Where practicable, direct reamers by mechanical means.
 Perform drilling and reaming with twist drills. Make drilled or reamed holes cylindrical,
 perpendicular to the member, and complying with the size requirements of these Specifications.
 Remove burrs on the outside surfaces. If required, take apart assembled parts for removal of
 burrs caused by drilling.
 Poor matching of holes will be cause for rejection.
 (c) Accuracy of Punched and Drilled Holes - Locate all holes punched full size, subpunched,
 or subdrilled so accurately that after assembling (before any reaming is done) a cylindrical pin
 1/8 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole may be entered
 perpendicular to the face of the member, without drifting, in at least 75 percent of the connecting
 holes in the same plane. Non-conforming pieces will be rejected. If any hole will not pass a pin
 3/16 inch smaller than the nominal size of the hole, the non-conforming pieces will be rejected.
 (d) Accuracy of Drilled and Reamed Holes - When holes are drilled or reamed, 85 percent of
 the holes in any connecting group shall, after drilling or reaming, show no offset greater
 than 1/32 inch between adjacent thicknesses of metal.
 
 Provide steel templates with hardened steel bushings in holes and accurately dimensioned from
 centerlines of the connections inscribed on the template. Use the centerlines in accurately
 locating the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members. When steel templates
 1 inch or greater in thickness are used six or fewer times in drilling members, hardened steel
 bushings are not required.
 (e) Fitting for Bolting - Clean surfaces of metal in contact before assembling. Assemble, well
 pin, and firmly draw together the parts of a member before drilling, reaming, or bolting is
 commenced. Take apart assembled pieces, if necessary, for the removal of burrs and shavings
 produced by the operation. Construct the member free from twists, bends, and other
 deformation.
 
 Perform drift pinning during assembling only to bring the parts into position and not sufficient to
 enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
 503
 
 00560.27
 (f) Holes for High-Strength Bolts and Unfinished Bolts - Punch or drill all holes for
 high-strength bolts and unfinished bolts. When there are not more than five thicknesses of
 material in a member, and the material is not thicker than 3/4 inch for structural steel or 5/8 inch
 for high-strength steel, the metal may be punched 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of
 the bolts unless subpunching and reaming are required by these Specifications.
 
 When there are more than five material thicknesses in a member, or when any material is thicker
 than 3/4 inch for structural steel or 5/8 inch for high-strength steel, either sub drill holes or drill full
 size.
 When required by 00560.27(g), subpunch or sub drill all holes 3/16 inch smaller and, after
 assembling, ream 1/16 inch larger or drill full size to 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of
 the bolts. Sub drill if thickness limitation governs.
 Holes not more than 1/32 inch larger than the nominal diameter resulting from a drill or reamer of
 the nominal diameter are considered acceptable. The slightly conical hole from punching
 operations is considered acceptable.
 (g) Holes for Ribbed Bolts, Turned Bolts, and Others - Make holes with a driving fit as
 specified for ribbed bolts, turned bolts, or other approved bearing-type bolts by one of these
 methods:
 
 • Subpunch or sub drill 3/16 inch smaller than the nominal diameter of the bolt and ream,
 while assembled,
 • Drill to a steel template, or
 • Drill from the solid after assembling.
 (h) Holes for Field Connections:
 (1) Subpunching and Reaming Field Connections - Unless otherwise specified, subpunch
 (or sub drill if subdrilling is required according to 00560.27(f) or 00560.27(g)) and subsequently
 ream holes in all field connections and field splices of main members of trusses, arches,
 continuous beam spans, bents, towers (each face), plate girders, and rigid frames while
 assembled on a steel template, as required by 00560.43. Holes for field splices of rolled beam
 stringers continuous over floor beams or crossframes may be drilled full size unassembled to a
 steel template.
 
 Subpunch and ream all holes for floor beam and stringer field end connections to a steel
 template or ream while assembled. Drill or ream full size field connection holes through a steel
 template after the template has been carefully located as to position and angle and firmly
 bolted in place. Make templates used for reaming matching members, or the opposite faces of
 a single member, exact duplicates. Locate templates used for connections on like parts or
 members so accurately that the parts or members are duplicates and require no matchmarking.
 For any field connection, instead of subpunching and reaming or subdrilling and reaming, the
 Contractor may drill holes full size with all thicknesses of material assembled in proper
 position.
 Use templates as described above, or do not interchange splice plates.
 (2) Numerically Controlled Punched or Drilled Field Connections - Alternately, for any
 connection or splice designated in 00560.27(f), instead of subpunching and reaming field
 
 504
 
 00560.28
 connections according to 00560.27(h), the Contractor may punch or drill bolt holes full-size in
 unassembled pieces and connections, including templates, for use with matching subsized and
 reamed holes by means of suitable numerically controlled punching or drilling Equipment
 subject to this Section. Punch or drill full-size holes according to 00560.27(c).
 Submit for review a detailed outline of the procedures proposed for accomplishing the Work
 from initial punching or drilling through check assembly, if required. Include the specific
 members of the Structure that may be numerically controlled punched or drilled, the sizes of
 the holes, the location of common index and other reference points, composition of check
 assemblies, and all other pertinent information. Do not begin until written approval is received.
 Punch or drill holes by numerically controlled Equipment to appropriate size through individual
 pieces, or drill through any combination of pieces held tightly together. Use each splice plate
 only once as a template and do not interchange after assembly drilling is complete.
 If numerically controlled punching or drilling Equipment is used, the Engineer may require the
 Contractor, by means of check assemblies, to demonstrate that this punching or drilling
 procedure consistently produces holes and connections conforming to 00560.27(g)
 and 00560.43.
 00560.28 Carbon Steel Bolt Connections - Unless otherwise shown or specified, make
 connections with unfinished carbon steel bolts nuts and washers conforming to Section 02560. Use
 holes conforming to 00560.27.

 bolt as a replacement.
 • Nuts shall be hexagonal, with standard dimensions for bolts of nominal size specified or the
 next larger nominal size.
 (c) Washers - Use hardened washers of suitable thickness under the turning element (nut or bolt
 head) in tightening.
 
 505
 
 00560.29
 Use beveled washers where bearing faces have a Slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to the bolt axis.
 (d) Nuts - Use single self-locking nuts or double nuts unless otherwise shown or specified. The
 finished side shall be against the washer or plate.
 00560.29 High-Strength Bolt Connections:
 (a) General - When shown or specified, assemble structural joint connections with high-strength
 bolts conforming to AASHTO M 164 (ASTM A325) or equivalent fastener using bolts, nuts, and
 washers conforming to Section 02560 and in holes conforming to 00560.27.
 
 Fit-up bolted connections as follows:
 • Provide all steel material within the grip of high-strength bolts (no compressible material
 such as gaskets or insulation).
 • Remove burrs that would prevent solid seating, so that parts fit solidly together after bolts
 are tightened.
 • Make Slope of surfaces in contact with the bolt head or nut less than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to the bolt axis.
 • Install all bolts, unless otherwise shown, to expose the heads on the exterior surface of the
 Structure.
 (b) Washer Requirements:
 
 • Where the outer surface of the bolted parts has a Slope greater than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to the bolt axis, use a hardened, beveled washer to compensate for the lack of
 parallelism.
 • Where AASHTO M 164 (ASTM A325) bolts of any diameter are to be installed in standard,
 oversize, or short slotted hole in an outer ply, provide a hardened washer under the element
 of the fastener (nut or bolt head) turned in tightening.
 • Where AASHTO M 164 (ASTM A325) bolts of any diameter are to be installed in a long
 slotted hole in an outer ply, use plate washers or continuous bars of at least 5/16 inch
 thickness with standard holes. Provide washers or bars with sufficient size to completely
 cover the slot after installation. Make the plate washer from structural grade steel. In
 addition to a plate washer, provide a hardened washer under element of the fastener (nut or
 bolt head) turned in tightening.
 • Oversize and slotted holes are defined by the Manual of Steel Construction Load and
 Resistance Factor Design (AISC).
 (c) Surface Conditions - Make all joint surfaces including surfaces adjacent to the bolt head and
 nut free of scale, oil, grease, dirt, foreign material, and unless otherwise shown or specified, free
 of paint, lacquer, rust inhibitor, galvanizing or other coating.
 (1) Coated Members - Prepare and coat steel-to-steel contact surfaces within slip-critical
 bolted joints for coated steel according to Section 00594. Prior to assembly, prepare the
 contact surfaces with approved methods not harmful to the primer.
 
 Coat fasteners visible to the public, as determined by the Engineer, according to
 Section 00594 (except the primer coat) after installation. Mechanically galvanize all direct
 tension indicators according to 02560.40(b).
 
 506
 
 00560.29
 a. Non-Coastal Projects - On projects more than 25 aerial miles, of the Pacific Ocean, use
 high-strength fasteners either black or galvanized as the Contractor elects. Use fasteners
 that meet the following requirements:
 1. Black Fasteners - Clean black fasteners, including hardened washers, and the
 surrounding areas stained by the black fasteners, after installation, using an approved
 method. Coat according to Section 00594.
 2. Galvanized Fasteners - Clean and prepare fasteners as approved, in areas visible to
 the public, as determined by the Engineer, and coat according to Section 00594 after
 installation.
 b. Coastal Projects - On projects within 25 aerial miles of the Pacific Ocean, use
 high-strength fasteners, including hardened flat washers, galvanized according to 02560.40
 prior to installation. In areas visible to the public, as determined by the Engineer, clean and
 prepare fasteners as approved, and coat according to Section 00594.
 (2) Non-Coated Weathering Steel Members - Blast clean steel-to-steel contact surfaces
 within slip-critical bolted joints for non-coated weathering steel according to SSPC-SP 10 "Near
 White Blast Cleaning". Make the appearance of the blast-cleaned surface to closely
 approximate Pictorial Standard Sa 2-1/2 of SSPC-Vis 1.
 Use only fasteners that are black.
 weathering steel connections.
 
 Do not use direct tension indicators for non-coated
 
 (3) Galvanized Members - After galvanizing, roughen surfaces of galvanized slip critical
 connections by means of hand wire brushing. Power wire brushing is not allowed.
 (d) Verification Testing, Installation, and Inspection - Assign lot numbers (including rotational
 capacity lot numbers) to all fasteners before shipping them. Assemble all components during
 installation of the fasteners.
 Protect fasteners from dirt and moisture at the Project Site. Take from protected storage only as
 many fasteners as anticipated to be installed and tightened during a work shift. Return fasteners
 not used to protected storage at the end of the shift.
 Do not remove lubricant present in as-delivered condition. If necessary, clean and lubricate
 fasteners and retest before installation. Use lubricant according to 02560.70. Do not re-lubricate
 Tension Control fasteners.
 Install the bolt, nut, and washer or DTI assembly so that at least three and not more than five
 threads are located between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head.
 Tighten all connections progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to
 the free edges.
 The Engineer will do the following:
 
 • Before installing fasteners:
 • Check markings, surface conditions, and bolt, nut, washer and DTIs if used storage
 conditions, and faying surfaces of joints for compliance with 00560.29(c).
 • Observe calibration and testing procedures.
 
 • During fastener installation, monitor to:
 
 507
 
 00560.29
 • Confirm that the installation procedure is followed and that, when fastener assemblies are
 supplied, the tensions specified in Table 00560-1 are achieved.
 • Assure that the installation method demonstrated in the Verification Testing procedure
 develops the specified tension.
 Provide a tension measuring device at the Project Site that has the capacity for the bolt being
 installed. Confirm the accuracy of the tension-measuring device through calibration by an
 approved testing agency at the start of Work and at least annually. Use the tension-measuring
 device to:
 
 • Calibrate wrenches.
 • Assist the bolting crew in understanding and proper use of the method to be used.
 • Confirm the ability of the complete fastener assembly to be used in the Work, including
 lubrication satisfies the tension requirements of Table 00560-1.
 Install and tighten all fasteners in aligned holes to at least the tension specified in Table 00560-1.
 Tightening may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating when it is
 impracticable to turn the nut, if approved. When impact wrenches are used, provide them with
 enough capacity and supplied air to tighten each bolt in 10 seconds or less.
 Non-galvanized fasteners may be reused once if approved. Retightening previously tightened
 fasteners loosened by the tightening of adjacent fasteners will not be considered a reuse. Do not
 reuse galvanized fasteners.
 Use bolt, nut, and washer combinations from the same rotational-capacity lot.
 Verify correct lengths of all AASHTO M 164 (ASTM A325) bolts. In the tightened connection, do
 not allow the unthreaded portion of the bolt to jam against the internal threads of the nut.
 In these Specifications, "snug-tight" is defined as having all plies of the connection in firm contact.

 (1) Direct Tension Indicator Tightening - Test, install, and inspect direct tension
 indicators (DTIs) at the Project Site. Install DTIs under the head of the bolt with the nut turned
 to tension the bolt. Orient DTI protrusions against the bolt head or a hardened washer. Follow
 the manufacturer's recommendations for correct orientation of the DTI and additional washers,
 if any, required for the correct use of the DTI. Do not allow the surface contacting the
 protrusions of a DTI to turn during the tightening operation. Provide new, unused DTIs
 
 508
 
 00560.29
 galvanized according to 02560.40(b). Where tapered holes in washers are in contact with the
 protrusions of DTI washers, place the face with the smallest hole against the DTI.
 a. Testing:
 1. Rotational Capacity Testing - Perform Rotational Capacity Tests according
 to 02560.60.
 2. Verification Testing - Perform verification tests in a calibrated bolt tension-measuring
 device. Conduct three verification tests for each combination of fastener assembly,
 rotational-capacity lot, DTI lot, and DTI position relative to the turned element (bolt or
 nut).
 
 Use a special flat insert in place of the normal bolt head holding insert. Do not allow the
 restrained element to rotate. Install the fastener assembly in the tension-measuring
 device with the DTI located in the same position as in the Work.
 Conduct Verification Tests in two stages.
 First, tension the bolt to the load listed in Table 00560-2 under Verification Tension. If an
 impact wrench is used, tighten the nut using the impact wrench to no more than twothirds the required tension. Subsequently, use a manual wrench to attain the required
 tension.
 Record the number of refusals of a 0.005 inch tapered feeler gauge in the spaces
 between the protrusions.
 For uncoated DTIs under the stationary or turned element, or for coated DTIs used under
 the stationary element, do not exceed the number of refusals listed under Maximum
 Verification refusals in Table 00560-2.
 For coated DTIs under a turned element, do not exceed the number of spaces on the DTI
 less one.
 Reject the DTI lot if the number of refusals are not met.
 Next, after the number of refusals is recorded at the Verification Tension load, further
 tension the bolt until the 0.005 inch feeler gauge is refused at all spaces and a visible gap
 exists in at least one space. Record the load at this condition and remove the bolt from
 the tension-measuring device. Run the nut down by hand the complete thread length of
 the bolt, excluding the thread runout. If the nut cannot be run down for this thread length,
 reject the DTI lot unless the load recorded is less than 95 percent of the average load
 measured in the rotational capacity test for the fastener lot.
 If the bolt is too short to be tested in the calibration device, verify the DTI lot on a long
 bolt in a calibrator to determine the number of refusals at the Verification Tension listed in
 Table 00560-2. Reject the lot if the number of refusals exceeds the values listed under
 Maximum Verification Refusals in Table 00560-2. Verify another DTI from the same lot
 with the short bolt in a convenient hole in the work. Tension the bolt until the 0.005 inch
 feeler gauge is refused in all spaces and a visible gap exists in at least one space.
 Remove the bolt from the tension-measuring device. Run the nut down by hand the
 complete thread length of the bolt excluding the thread runout. Reject the DTI lot if the
 nut cannot be run down for this thread length.
 
 509
 
 00560.29
 b. Installation - Install DTI fastener assemblies using DTIs in two stages. Do not allow the
 stationary element to rotate.
 
 First, snug the connection with all bolts installed in all holes of the connection and tension to
 achieve a snug tight condition by snugging in multiple cycles. If the number of spaces in
 which a 0.005 inch feeler gauge is refused in the DTI after snugging exceeds those listed
 under Maximum Verification refusals in Table 00560-2, remove the fastener assembly and
 install and snug another DTI.
 Next, for uncoated DTIs under the stationary or turned element, or for coated DTIs used
 under the stationary element further tension the bolts until the number of refusals of
 the 0.005 inch feeler gauge is equal to or greater than the number listed under Minimum
 Installation Refusals in Table 00560-2. If the bolt is tensioned so that no visible gap in any
 space remains, remove the bolt and DTI, and replace with a new properly tensioned bolt
 and DTI.
 Tighten coated DTIs under the turned element to achieve 0.005 inch feeler gauge refusal in
 all space locations.

 c. Inspection - In the presence and at the direction of the Engineer, inspect completed DTI
 connections.
 
 Select, at random, 10 percent of the DTIs or at least two, whichever is greater, for each
 separate connection. Probe each DTI washer being inspected with the 0.005 inch feeler
 gauge and document the number of refusals. If the number of refusals meets the Minimum
 Installation Refusals listed in Table 00560-2 consider the fastener to be correctly tensioned.
 If the number of refusals does not meet the Minimum Installation Refusals listed in
 Table 00560-2, test each DTI in the connection with the 0.005 inch feeler gauge and tighten
 to meet the Minimum Installation Refusals requirements.
 (2) Tension Control Fasteners Tightening - Test, install, and inspect tension control
 fasteners at the Project Site.
 a. Testing:
 1. Rotational Capacity Testing - Perform Rotational Capacity Tests according
 to 02560.60.
 
 510
 
 00560.29
 2. Verification Testing - Perform Verification Testing in a calibrated bolt
 tension-measuring device. Test a representative sample of not less than three bolt and
 nut assemblies of each diameter, length, and grade to be used.
 
 Use a special round head insert in place of the typical hex head insert.
 Repeat Verification Testing when the condition of fasteners are altered, when changes in
 method, Equipment or personnel occur, or as directed.
 Conduct verification tests in two stages:
 First, demonstrate the method for estimating the snug-tight condition to be used on the
 final product. Record the snug-tight tension.
 Next, apply a tension control shear wrench to demonstrate that each bolt develops a
 tension not less than 5 percent greater than required by Table 00560-1. Follow
 manufacturer's installation procedure for installation of bolts. Record the final tension.
 3. Inspection Torque - Determine Inspection Torque in a calibrated bolt
 tension-measuring device. Provide a torque wrench with sufficient capacity to perform
 testing. Match the sampled fastener conditions to the conditions under inspection. Test
 at least three randomly sampled bolt, nut, and washer assemblies for each diameter,
 length, and grade used. Tension the sampled bolts to the specified tension in
 Table 00560-1 by any convenient means. Apply the Inspection Torque wrench to the
 tensioned bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately
 1 inch at a 12 inch radius) in the tensioning direction. Calculate the Inspection Torque by
 averaging the three bolt, nut and washer assemblies of each diameter, length, and grade.
 
 Repeat the Inspection Torque determination when the fasteners conditions are altered,
 when changes in method, Equipment, or personnel occur, or as directed.
 b. Installation - Install tension control fasteners in two stages.
 
 First, Using the method developed in the Verification Testing procedure, snug the
 connection with all bolts installed in all holes of the connection and tension to achieve
 snug-tight condition.
 Next, apply the tension control shear wrench until the spline fractures.
 c. Inspection - In the presence and at the direction of the Engineer, inspect completed
 connections using the Inspection Torque wrench and visually inspect splines for each bolt in
 the connection. Conduct inspection tests before loss of lubricant and before corrosion
 begins.
 
 Select at random 10 percent or at least two, whichever is greater, of the tensioned bolts and
 nuts on the Structure for each separate connection. Apply the Inspection Torque to each
 nut in the tensioning direction. If the Inspection Torque does not turn the bolt or nut, the
 connection will be considered properly tensioned. If the Inspection Torque turns the bolt or
 nut, apply the Inspection Torque to all the bolts and nut in the connection. Re-tension and
 re-inspect all bolts and nuts that turned at this inspection. The Contractor may re-tension all
 the bolts in the connection and resubmit it for inspection, provided fasteners assemblies are
 not damaged.

 (3) Turn-of-Nut Fastener Tightening - Test, install, and inspect turn-of-nut fasteners at the
 Project site.
 a. Testing:
 1. Rotational Capacity Testing - Perform Rotational Capacity Tests according
 to 02560.60.
 2. Verification Testing - Perform verification testing in a calibrated bolt
 tension-measuring device. Test a representative sample of not less than three bolt and
 nut assemblies of each diameter, length, and grade used.
 
 Repeat Verification Testing if the condition of fasteners are altered, when changes in
 method, Equipment or personnel occur, or as directed.
 Conduct verification tests in two stages:
 First, demonstrate the method for estimating the snug-tight condition using the same
 method to be used on the final product. Record the snug-tight tension. Match mark the
 bolt, nut, and plate.
 Next, apply a tensioning wrench to achieve the nut rotation requirement of Table 00560-3
 and develop a tension of not less than 5 percent greater than required in Table 00560-1.
 If necessary, increase rotation to meet these requirements. Record all tension and
 rotation readings.
 3. Inspection Torque - Determine Inspection Torque in a calibrated bolt
 tension-measuring device. Provide a torque wrench with sufficient capacity to perform
 testing. Match the sampled fastener conditions to the conditions under inspection. Test
 at least three randomly sampled bolt, nut, and washer assemblies for each diameter,
 length, and grade used. Tension the sampled bolts to the specified tension in
 Table 00560-1 by any convenient means. Apply the Inspection Torque wrench to the
 tensioned bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately
 1 inch at a 12 inch radius) in the tensioning direction. Calculate the Inspection Torque by
 averaging three bolt, nut, and washer assemblies of each diameter, length, and grade.
 
 Repeat the Inspection Torque determination when the fastener conditions are altered,
 when changes in method, Equipment, or personnel occur, or as directed.
 b. Installation - Install fasteners using Turn-of-Nut method in two stages:
 
 First, using the method developed in the Verification Testing procedure, snug the
 connection with all bolts installed in all holes of the connection and tension to achieve
 snug-tight condition by snugging in multiple cycles. Match mark each fastener bolt, nut and
 plate.
 Next, apply the tensioning wrench to achieve the nut rotation determined during the
 Verification Testing. Do not allow the bolt to turn during the tightening process.
 c. Inspection - In the presence and at the direction of the Engineer, inspect completed
 connections using the Inspection Torque wrench and the match marked nut rotation for
 each bolt in the connection. Conduct inspection tests before loss of lubricant and before
 corrosion begins.
 
 512
 
 00560.40
 Select at random 10 percent or at least two, whichever is greater, of the tensioned bolts and
 nuts on the Structure for each separate connection. Apply the Inspection Torque to each
 nut the tensioning direction. If the Inspection Torque does not turn the bolt or nut, the
 connection will be considered properly tensioned. If the Inspection Torque turns the bolt or
 nut, apply the Inspection Torque to all bolts in the connection. Re-tension and re-inspect all
 bolts and nuts that turned at this inspection. The Contractor may re-tension all the bolts in
 the connection and resubmit it for inspection, provided fastener assemblies are not
 damaged.

 • Furnish as many copies of material orders, shipping statements and erection diagrams as
 directed and show the weights of the individual members on the statements.
 • Brace the girders properly and adequately, so as to eliminate cyclic out-of-plane bending
 stresses in the web gap between the end of stiffener on the web and the girder flange due to
 cyclic swaying motion in transit. Take care to minimize dynamic loads transmitted to girder
 support points during transit.
 • Furnish the Engineer stamped detail Plans of loading, unloading, supporting and bracing of the
 steel plate girders on trucks or cars for shipment to the Project Site, according to 00150.35.
 The review will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for safe transportation of steel
 members.
 00560.46 Erecting:
 (a) General - Erect the metalwork, remove temporary construction and do all Work required to
 complete the Structures, including the removal of the old Structures according to Section 00501,
 if specified.
 (b) Methods and Equipment - Before starting the erection Work, the erection method proposed
 and the amount and character of Equipment to be used will be reviewed. This review will not
 relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the safety of the method or Equipment, or from
 carrying out the Work in full according to the Plans and Specifications. Do not perform Work until
 approval has been obtained.
 (c) Falsework - Design, construct, maintain and remove falsework according to 00540.41,

 steel according to the following:
 
 • Drill holes for anchor bolts and set them in portland cement grout, or preset them as
 specified.
 • Locate anchors and set rockers or rollers considering variation from mean temperature at
 the time of setting, and anticipated lengthening of bottom chord or bottom flange due to
 dead load after setting. As nearly as practicable, at mean temperature and under dead
 load, the rockers and rollers shall stand vertically and anchor bolts at expansion bearings
 shall center their slots.
 • Provide full and free movement of the Superstructure at moveable bearings. Make sure it is
 not restricted by improper setting or adjustment of bearings or anchor bolts and nuts.
 (g) Assembling Steel - Handle the material carefully so no parts will be bent, broken or
 otherwise damaged.
 
 Do not perform hammering which will injure or distort the members.
 Prepare bearing surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent contact before the members are
 assembled.
 Assemble the parts accurately as shown, following any match-marks.
 Unless erecting by the cantilever method, erect truss spans on blocking that gives the trusses
 proper Camber. Leave the blocking in place until the tension chord splices are completed and all
 other truss connections are pinned and bolted.
 Use fitting-up bolts of the same nominal diameter as the high-strength bolts, and cylindrical
 erection pins 1/32 inch larger.
 Fill 50 percent of the holes in splices and field connections with equal numbers of fitting-up bolts
 and cylindrical erection pins before bolting with high-strength bolts. Fill 75 percent of the holes in
 splices and connections carrying added construction loads during erection with equal numbers of
 fitting up bolts and erection pins.

 span, if movable, has been swung.
 Perform all field welding according to AWS D1.5 and all interim specifications.
 (h) Pin Connection - Use pilot and driving nuts when driving pins. Drive pins so the members
 take full bearing on them. Screw pin nuts up tight and burr the threads at the face of the nut with
 a pointed tool.
 
 518
 
 00560.90
 (i) Misfits - The correction of minor misfits involving small amounts of reaming, cutting, and
 chipping will be considered a legitimate part of the erection. However, immediately report to the
 Engineer any error in the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling, storage and
 transportation which prevents the proper assembling and fitting up of parts by the moderate use
 of drift pins, or by a moderate amount of reaming and slight chipping or cutting. Have the
 correction method approved. Make the correction in the Engineer's presence. The Contractor
 shall be responsible for all misfits, errors and injuries. Make the necessary corrections and
 replacements as approved by the Engineer.

 damaged by erection or other Contractor operations. Completely clean all existing lead-based
 coatings exposed by the removal of any structural or miscellaneous member to SSPC-SP 15
 "Commercial Grade Power Tool Cleaning" requirements. Extend all prepared areas at
 least 2 inches into tightly adhering, intact paint. Overlap the subsequent coating and the still
 intact coating by a minimum of 2 inches. Lightly sand the overlap area of the intact coating to
 provide a profile for the subsequent repair coating to adhere to.
 (d) Non-Steel Metallic Substrates:
 (1) Galvanized Surfaces - Prepare surfaces to be coated according to ASTM D6386.
 (2) Aluminum - Prepare aluminum surfaces by using one of the following methods:
 
 • Solvent clean surfaces to be coated according to SSPC-SP 1, then follow by a light brush
 blast according to SSPC SP 16 “Brush-Off Blast Cleaning of Coated and Uncoated
 Galvanized Steel, Stainless Steels, and Non-Ferrous Metals” with a maximum nozzle
 pressure of 75 psi.
 • Hand sand the surface, creating a minimum 1 mil profile.
 • Clean the surface according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
 (e) All Metal Structures - Remove fins, tears, slivers, sharp edges, and hardened or damaged
 edges according to SSPC Paint Application Guide No. 11.
 
 Clean all surfaces of material detrimental to the application of the coating system as follows:
 (1) Cleaning Methods - Blast-clean surfaces using one or more of the following methods to
 discharge the abrasive:
 
 • A stream of high-pressure air
 • A rotating centrifugal paddlewheel
 • A stream of high-pressure water
 Surfaces shall be dry before cleaning unless a wet blast cleaning method is used. Use
 methods specified in SSPC-SP 1, "Solvent Cleaning", SSPC-SP 2, "Hand Tool Cleaning",
 
 569
 
 00594.42
 SSPC-SP 3, "Power Tool Cleaning", and SSPC-SP 15 "Commercial Grade Power Tool Clean",
 as necessary to augment blast-cleaning.
 (2) Abrasives - Perform blast-cleaning using an abrasive of a size which will continually
 produce an angular surface profile of at least 1 mil, but not more than 4 mils, as measured
 according to ASTM D4417 using replica tape on the prepared surface. The blast-cleaning
 shall result in a roughened steel surface comparable to a Keane-Tator Surface Profile
 Comparator for sand or grit using ASTM D4417.
 
 When removing coatings with lead or chromium, use a mineral slag abrasive combined with an
 approved additive to render the removed coating material non-hazardous. Obtain approval for
 the specific abrasive blast additive before use.
 If a centrifugal wheel with a grit mixer is used for blast-cleaning, inspect each member and for
 those members not meeting the comparator or profile requirements, perform a final blastcleaning with high-pressure air with an abrasive to obtain the specified profile.
 Provide abrasives that have no corrosion products, water, oil, or any other material detrimental
 to the application and adherence of the coatings. Provide abrasives that conform to
 SSPC-AB 1. When directed, test cleanliness according to ASTM D7393 and ASTM D4940.
 The conductivity results from ASTM D4940 shall not exceed 100 microsiemens per centimeter.
 Wet abrasives are allowed if wet sandblasting methods are used.
 (3) Air - For blast-cleaning or blowing down, use high-pressure air that is free of water, oil, or
 any other material detrimental to the coating system. Provide adequate separators and traps.
 Test compressed air cleanliness daily according to ASTM D4285, or as directed.
 (4) Water - Use water for water jet cleaning that is clean, potable and does not contain more
 than 75 milligrams per liter of chlorides or 200 milligrams per liter of sulfates. Filter, recycle,
 and dispose of water when surface soluble salt levels cannot consistently be kept below
 70 microsiemens per centimeter, measured with a conductivity meter capable of reading
 to 1 microsiemen per centimeter.
 
 Use a rust inhibitor that is recommended by the coating manufacturer. Use the rust inhibitor to
 prepare a test panel at least 14 Calendar Days before beginning Work, to show that the
 inhibitor does not cause loss of bond between the steel substrate and the primer. Do not use
 the rust inhibitor product if the test panel does not meet the adhesion requirements
 of 00594.43(g).
 (5) Cleaning Procedures - Perform blast-cleaning operations and pressure washing, as
 required, without damaging partially or entirely completed portions of the Work. Do not
 blast-clean adjacent to areas being coated.
 
 Examine blast-cleaned and pressure washed surfaces for any traces of corrosion, water, oil,
 grease, soluble salts, and other material deposited during the cleaning operations. If present,
 remove any detrimental material by solvent cleaning and blast-clean the surface again.
 (6) Final Preparation - Do not begin coating before:
 
 • Blowing down prepared surfaces using high pressure air within the fully enclosed
 containment, with the specified ventilation operating, and supplemented by brushing if
 required.
 • Determining that the prepared surfaces are free of all residues, according to SSPC PA-1.
 
 570
 
 00594.43
 • Repairing all damaged galvanizing according to ASTM A780.
 • Obtaining approval from the Engineer.
 (f) Pack Rust Removal - Fully remove pack rust using either of the following methods:
 
 • Mechanically, in combination with saturating the pack rust with water at 3,000 psi and
 heating to a minimum of 250 °F and a maximum of 400 °F.
 • Blast with ultra-high pressure water jetting at 35,000 psi.
 00594.43 Coating Metal Structures:
 (a) Description - When not in conflict with this Section and the Special Provisions, perform
 coating application according to the following:
 • The applicable portions of SSPC-PA 1.
 • The recommendations of the coating manufacturer.
 • The best practices of the trade according to SSPC Painting Manual, Volume 1, "Good
 Painting Practice".
 (b) Application Site Mixing, Thinning, and Storage of Coating Materials:
 (1) Rejection - Reject and do not use the contents of a container if:
 • The material does not arrive at the application site in the original, unopened
 manufacturer's containers.
 • The container is punctured or has a break in the lid seal.
 • The coating materials have begun to polymerize, solidify, gel, or deteriorate in any other
 manner.
 • The recommended shelf life, as stated in the manufacturer's product data sheets, has
 expired.
 (2) Mixing - Thoroughly mix coating materials by mechanical means to ensure a uniform
 composition. Do not mix coating materials by means of air stream bubbling or boxing. Mix in
 the original container and continue until all pigment or metallic powder is in suspension.
 Ensure that all solid coating material that may have settled to the bottom of the container is
 thoroughly dispersed. After mixing, inspect the coating materials for uniformity and to ensure
 that no unmixed pigment or lumps are present.
 Add separately packaged catalysts, curing agents, hardeners, initiators or dry metallic powders
 to the base coating material only after the base coating material is thoroughly mixed to achieve
 a uniform mixture with all particles wetted. Add the proper volume of curing agent to the
 correct volume of base with constant agitation. Use the mixture within the pot life specified by
 the manufacturer. Discard unused portions at the end of each workday.
 (3) Thinning - Do not add additional thinner at the application site unless approved by the
 Engineer. If allowed, furnish the amount and type of thinner conforming to the manufacturer's
 recommendations.
 (4) Straining - Strain all coating materials after mixing to remove undesirable matter, but not
 pigment or metallic powder.
 
 571
 
 00594.43
 (5) Agitation - If recommended by the manufacturer, constantly agitate coating materials
 during application by using paint pots equipped with mechanical agitators.
 (6) Storage - Store the coating material and solvents in original containers. Store the
 containers in a weather-tight space where the temperature is maintained between 40 °F and
 100 °F or according to the manufacturer recommendations, whichever is more restrictive.
 (c) Application of Coating:
 (1) Surface Condition - Ensure that surfaces to be coated are free of moisture, dust, grease
 or other substances that would prevent the bonding of succeeding applications. Protect freshly
 coated surfaces from contamination by abrasives, dust or foreign materials from any source.
 Do not apply succeeding coats until the Engineer has approved the prepared surface.
 (2) Application Methods - Apply coating materials by air or airless spray, brush, roller, any
 combination of these methods, or as recommended by the coating material manufacturer,
 unless otherwise specified. If air is used for application, ensure that it is free of water, oil, or
 any other material detrimental to the coating system. Provide adequate separators and traps
 and test air cleanliness daily according to ASTM D4285, or as directed. Regardless of which
 application method is used to apply the coating, use brushes to push the coating into complex
 details, crevices, gaps, areas difficult to access, and where spraying does not adequately
 cover or penetrate. All application techniques shall conform to Section 7 in SSPC-PA 1 and
 the applicable sections of SSPC Paint Application Guide No. 11.
 
 Apply subsequent coats of paint in sufficiently different shades so that skips and holidays can
 be easily detected.
 Apply each coat in a uniform layer, completely covering the preceding coat. Correct runs,
 sags, skips or other deficiencies before application of succeeding coats. Perform re-cleaning,
 application of additional coating, or other measures, as directed by the Engineer, at no
 additional cost to the Agency.
 For each applicator, perform at least one WFT test 15 minutes after beginning coating
 application and one WFT test per hour thereafter. Test immediately after coating application
 and report results.
 (d) Coating Requirements:
 (1) Number of Coats and Film Thickness - Apply all coats to the minimum thickness
 specified in the manufacturer's product data sheet for the coatings.
 
 Apply the coating system in the number of coats specified in the QPL, with each coat
 consisting of as many applications as necessary to cover the Work and achieve the minimum
 thickness specified for the coat.
 On steel-to-steel contact surfaces, apply only zinc primer coating. On steel-to-concrete
 contact surfaces, apply the full coating system so that it extends 1 inch into the steel-toconcrete contact surface if accessible. On steel-to-wood contact surfaces, apply all coatings
 specified.
 The dry film thickness of the primer on steel-to-steel contact surfaces shall not be less than
 3 mils nor more than the manufacturer's class "B" certification allows.
 Do not assemble coated joints before the coatings have cured for at least the time used in the
 qualifying test, or as recommended by the manufacturer.
 572
 
 00594.43
 (2) Stripe Coats - On maintenance coating projects, apply a prime stripe coat by hand before
 applying the full prime coat and apply an intermediate stripe coat by hand before applying the
 full intermediate coat. Apply the stripe coat by brush only. Use brushes to push the coating
 around and into complex details and irregular surfaces. Make each stripe coat a different color
 than the preceding and subsequent full coat, extending a minimum of 1 inch from the irregular
 surface, and completely hiding the substrate. The stripe coat shall be a different color and be
 approximately 3 mils thick. Each stripe coat will have its own hold point and shall not be used
 to correct deficiencies in the preceding or subsequent coats. Apply stripe coats according to
 the applicable sections of SSPC Paint Application Guide No. 11 that do not conflict with this
 Section or the Special Provisions.
 
 A brush-augmented hold coat may be applied prior to the full prime coat as the stripe coat to
 prevent rust-back of the cleaned steel surfaces, if approved by the Engineer. Submit hold coat
 procedure to the Engineer prior to hold coat operations. If rust-back, rust bloom, or rust stains
 are present on the surface after the hold coat application prior to full prime coat, re-prepare the
 surface according to 00594.42 and re-submit the hold coat procedure to the Engineer.
 (3) Coating Thickness and Coverage Requirements - The Engineer will take dry coating
 thickness measurements after the application of each coat and before application of the
 succeeding coat. In addition to coating thickness measurements, a visual inspection for
 complete coverage will be made by the Engineer after each coat. Apply each coat in sufficient
 thickness to achieve uniform and complete coverage and appearance. If all thickness
 measurements are not within the specified minimum dry film thickness, or if the visual
 inspection does not satisfy the Engineer, make additional applications, as necessary, to meet
 the thickness and coverage required. Film thickness will be measured above the peaks of the
 profile of the anchor pattern in the metal substrate.
 
 The Engineer will take dry film thickness measurements with a type 2 gauge according to
 SSPC-PA 2. The minimum dry film thickness measurements and frequency of measurements
 will be according to SSPC-PA 2, modified as follows:
 • A single gauge reading will be taken for each 10 square feet of surface area.
 • A spot measurement is only taken at locations where a gauge reading is less than
 100 percent of the Project's specified minimum DFT.
 • All spot measurements shall meet 100 percent of the Project's specified minimum DFT.
 • Additional readings may be required to identify the limits of the non-compliant areas.
 If a question arises about an individual coat thickness or coverage, it will be verified using a
 Tooke gauge, according to ASTM D4138. If the Tooke gauge shows a prime coat to be less
 than the specified minimum thickness, or reveals a missing intermediate coat, the total coating
 system will be rejected even if the thickness of the total system equals or exceeds total
 specified thickness.
 In areas where dry film thickness measurements are impracticable, wet film thickness
 measurements will be made according to ASTM D4414.
 (4) Additional Top Coat Requirements - Even if the total thicknesses of prime and
 intermediate coats exceed the specified thicknesses of the prime and intermediate coats, apply
 the top coat to at least the minimum required topcoat thickness, to provide uniform and
 complete coverage and appearance.
 (e) Time of Application - Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, prime existing steel
 Structure surfaces according to one of the following methods:
 
 573
 
 00594.43
 • Prime on the same Day that the surfaces are cleaned.
 • Apply an approved rust inhibitor to the entire surface on the same Day as cleaning, and
 prime within 48 hours after inhibitor application.
 • Reblast all surfaces prior to coating.
 Before priming surfaces prepared by waterjetting, ensure that the surfaces do not exceed "Light"
 flash rust as defined by the "Wipe Test" in SSPC-SP WJ-2. Ensure that all other surfaces are dry
 and free of flash rust before priming.
 Apply each coat over the preceding coat as soon as possible, allowing for drying time of the
 preceding coat, weather, temperature, and similar factors, as well as the manufacturer's
 recommendations. Re-prepare a primer coat that exhibits freckle rust or is exposed to the
 weather for more than 60 days, according to 00594.42.
 Allow each coat to dry and sufficiently cure before
 can be applied without delamination, blistering,

 for recoat times unless they conflict with this
 revise recoat times without receiving approval
 
 (f) Caulking - Apply caulk after complete application of the top coat. Fill and seal crevices and
 gaps between structural shapes and plates, around bolt heads and nuts, and similar areas that
 would retain moisture, with the following:
 
 • Caulk, if the crevice or gap cannot be filled with coating materials.
 • Backing material and caulk to fill the crevices and gaps that exceed 1/4 inch.
 Apply caulk over the backing material to form a watertight seal.
 In areas that collect or channel water, apply caulk even if coating fills the gap.
 (g) Adhesion - Perform adhesion tests according to ASTM D4541, Standard Test Method for
 Pull-Off Strength of Coatings Using Portable Adhesion Testers, using "Test Method D, E, or F",
 as warranted or at the direction of the Engineer. Ensure that a minimum pull-off strength
 of 650 psi is achieved for zinc-rich primers and tar based coatings, and that a minimum pull-off
 strength of 1,000 psi is achieved for all other coatings, including those over a zinc-rich primer.
 When testing a coating or coating system with a DFT of more than 12 mils, score around the test
 fixture.
 (h) Environmental Conditions - Test environmental conditions according to ASTM E337 and
 apply coating materials only during periods when:
 
 • Air temperature is above 45 F
 • Steel surface temperature is:
 • Greater than 45 F
 • Less than 115 F
 • At least 5 F above the dew point
 • Relative humidity is within the manufacturer's recommended range
 Do not apply coating materials if the Engineer determines that conditions are not favorable for
 proper application and performance of the coating.
 574
 
 00594.44
 If fresh coatings are damaged by the elements, replace or repair at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 If a coating system allows application in environmental conditions different from those specified,
 submit a letter from the manufacturer stating the conditions under which the coatings can be
 applied. Application under conditions other than specified will not be allowed without the
 Engineer's written approval.
 Cover and protect the metal if coating is to be applied in adverse weather conditions. Heat the
 metal and surrounding air to the temperature specified in this subsection. Continue protecting the
 newly coated surfaces until the coating achieves proper cure.
 (i) Stenciling - Stencil the month and year of application and the type of coating used in block
 letters 2 inches high at a location on each end of each span on the Structure being coated. The
 exact location of stenciling will be determined by the Engineer. Use flat black color stenciling
 unless otherwise directed.
 00594.44 Inspecting - The Engineer will inspect each phase of preparation and coating. Do not
 proceed with succeeding phases until approved. Provide the Inspector timely access to areas
 where Work is being performed. Allow adequate time for inspection at each hold point. Hold points
 are the following:
 
 • Before cleaning operations begin
 • After cleaning operations are completed and before application of any coating materials
 • After each stripe coat
 • After each full coat
 • After cleaning in conjunction with coating repairs
 • After application of each coat in coating repairs
 • After application of last coat, before moving work platforms and containment structures

 • Meets the Aggregate hardness tolerances of 00622.41.
 • Is true to grade.
 • Has a longitudinal line-type texture with corrugations parallel to the outside Pavement edge
 which present a narrow ridge corduroy type appearance.
 • Has at least 95 percent of the Pavement surface textured. When approved, depressed
 Pavement areas and other localized depressed areas will not require texturing.
 Extra depth grinding is not required where minor depressions are detected in the existing
 Pavement.
 Provide at least a 2.0 inch longitudinal overlap when producing multiple Passes but keep overlaps
 over 2.0 inches to a minimum.
 Maintenance

 profile testing (GPT) method according to ODOT TM 770. Before beginning grinding on the
 Project, demonstrate the profilograph and profilometer operation by conducting a calibration
 test according to ODOT TM 770, and running the machine twice over a 0.1 mile section of
 Pavement with repeating results.
 
 The Pavement shall have a profile index of 7.0 inches per mile or less for each wheel path in
 each 0.1 mile segment or partial segment, and shall have no individual deviation of 0.3 inch or
 more.
 (2) Surface Test - Provide a complete graphic profile by running the profilograph or
 profilometer over the full length of the lanes ground and 50 feet beyond the ends. Provide a
 profile in each vehicle wheel path by running profiles on the Pavement surface along lines
 parallel to and approximately 3 feet from each edge of the Pavement and 3 feet from each side
 of longitudinal joints.
 (3) Determining Profile Index:
 a. General - Determine the profile index of Pavement in 0.1 mile segments and partial
 segments. A segment will end and will be considered a partial segment and a new segment
 will begin when the segment sequence is interrupted by stage construction or by profiled
 areas excluded from the GPT smoothness requirements.
 
 The following profiled areas of Pavement are excluded from the GPT smoothness
 requirements:
 • Profiles extending beyond the Project ends
 • Bridge decks and bridge panels
 • First and last 13 feet at the Project ends and bridge end panels
 • Pavement on horizontal curves with radii less than 1,000 feet
 Include and analyze separately those areas in the profile charts that are not subject to the
 GPT smoothness profile index requirements.

 50 feet long, placed side by side to form a typical seam between them. The width of the Panels
 shall be the same as the Contractor plans to use on the streets. Place the strip at least 24 hours
 prior to the beginning of the actual Work. Use the strip to calculate and monitor the rate of
 application in relation to weight of material per area, and to define the speed of the Equipment
 related to the rate of application. If it is determined by the Engineer on the basis of this test strip that
 there are deficiencies in the mix design, method of application and rate of application, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to revise the mix design, or repair or modify the Equipment or
 application. After all changes are made, lay a new sample strip.
 00706.45 Joints - Construct a uniform line along the edge and a good seal at curb lines. Construct
 the flow line at curbs to allow storm drainage flow to catch basins without bonding along the curb
 line. In the case of a concrete gutter, cover the gutter line joint with the slurry seal, but do not
 overlap onto the gutter. Remove any overlap, as determined by the Engineer, at no additional cost
 to the Agency. Streets that have been recently slurry sealed that cross this Project shall not be
 slurry sealed again.
 
 The slurry joints and Panels shall be straight, neat and uniform and follow the contour of the existing
 curb or concrete gutter. The width of the Panels shall be the same as demonstrated in the sample
 strip. Floating (adding additional water other than what is required for the approved mix design) of
 the emulsion or slurry mixture in the pug mill and/or spreader box to cover or overlap missed areas
 will be prohibited. Keep lines straight at intersections to provide a good appearance.
 00706.46 Handwork - Use approved squeegees to spread slurry in areas not accessible to the
 slurry mixer.
 
 Limit handwork at the beginning and end of the Panels to prevent segregation of the Rock from the
 emulsion and to minimize cosmetic drag mop marks and/or defects in the finished product.
 The same type finish as applied by the spreader box shall be required. Complete handwork prior to
 setting of the slurry.
 00706.47 Curing - The rate of curing of the slurry seal shall be such that a street may be opened to
 traffic after application without tracking or damage to the surface. Protect the area for the full curing
 period with suitable barricades or markers.
 
 656
 
 00706.90
 The Agency will not be responsible for any damage to the slurry seal prior to opening the area.
 Repair all damage to the slurry, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 00706.48 Rolling - If required by Special Provision, apply a minimum of two full coverage Passes
 to the surfaced areas by the roller, or as directed.
 00706.49 Cleanup - Remove all debris associated with the performance of the Work on a daily
 basis.
 Temporary
 00706.51 Provision for Traffic - Be responsible for notifying all abutting property owners along the
 streets according to the approved schedule, or an approved revision of the schedule, 48 hours prior
 to the specific Work.
 
 Remove all traffic control promptly when it is determined that the street may be open to traffic. Do
 not seal any street that requires closing overnight without the approval of the Engineer.
 If the slurry seal does not cure in a timely manner and remains trackable overnight, apply a covering
 of 1/4 inch minus material to prevent tracking and related property damage prior to permitting traffic
 on the street at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Be responsible for all damage to the uncured slurry or to private or public property due to tracking of
 the uncured material.

 Asphalt - Furnish
 polymer-modified
 Emulsified
 Asphalt
 or
 non-polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt as specified for the single application Emulsified Asphalt
 surface treatment design designated in the Plans or Special Provisions.
 When
 non-polymer- modified Emulsified Asphalt is designated, the Contractor may elect to substitute a
 polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt, however, selection of the polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt
 will not be cause for additional compensation.
 (a) Non-Polymer-Modified Emulsified Asphalt - When non-polymer-modified Emulsified
 Asphalt is specified, use CRS-2 or HFRS-2 Emulsified Asphalt as the Contractor elects.
 (b) Polymer-Modified Emulsified Asphalt - When polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt is

 Project.
 
 659
 
 00710.15
 Excessive delay in the use of the Emulsified Asphalt or excessive pumping of the Emulsified
 Asphalt may significantly reduce the viscosity and may make the material unsuitable for surface
 treatment use. For this reason limit pumping between the bulk storage tank, hauling
 transportation, field storage tanks and distributor to an absolute minimum to maintain proper
 viscosity. Final acceptance of Emulsified Asphalt will be at the point of application.
 Obtain samples of Emulsified Asphalt according to AASHTO T 40 at the frequency indicated in
 the MFTP. Samples will be tested at the ODOT Materials Laboratory, or other laboratory as
 designated by the Agency. Non-polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt will be tested within
 30 Calendar Days from the date it is sampled. Polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt will be tested
 within 14 Calendar Days from the date it is sampled.
 00710.15 Aggregate Production Quality Control - Provide quality control during production of
 Aggregate according to Section 00165. Sampling and Testing shall be performed by a CAgT at the
 minimum frequency schedule indicated in the MFTP.
 (a) Quality Control Compliance - Evaluate Aggregates for compliance according to the
 following:
 (1) Gradation - Analyze gradation statistically according to Section 00165. A stockpile
 contains specification Aggregate when the Pay Factor (PF) for each sieve size calculated
 according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than 1.00. Each required sample represents a
 sublot.
 
 When the results from Table 00165-2 yield a Pay Factor of less than 1.00 for any sieve size,
 the material is non-specification. The Engineer will reject any stockpile of Aggregate
 containing non-specification material unless the non-specification material is removed from the
 stockpile. Do not add additional material to such a stockpile until enough non-specification
 material is removed so that the PF for each sieve size is equal to or greater than 1.00.
 (2) Other Tests - Stop production, make appropriate operational adjustments, and remove all
 failing material from the stockpile whenever a quality control test result, other than sieve
 analysis, does not meet Specifications. Document operational adjustments made and notify
 the Engineer prior to resuming production.
 (3) Preproduced Aggregate - Compliance of Aggregates produced and stockpiled before the
 Award of this Contract will be determined by either of the following:
 
 • Continuing production records meeting the requirements of 00710.10 and 00710.15.
 • Sampling according to AASHTO T 2 and testing the entire stockpile at the minimum
 frequency schedule indicated in the MFTP. The material shall meet the requirements
 of 00710.10 and 00710.15.
 (b) Materials on Hand - Payment for stockpiled materials on hand may be allowed as described
 in 00195.60 subject to meeting the requirements of 00710.10 and 00710.15.
 00710.16 Acceptance of Aggregate - The Contractors quality control tests will be used for
 acceptance of Aggregates if verified by the Agency's quality assurance program. The Agency will

 to the Aggregate surface) on the Aggregate will not be allowed.
 Do not operate the chip spreader at speeds which cause the chips to roll over after striking the
 emulsion covered surface.
 Provide coverage without gaps or overlapping adjacent coverages. Do not construct longitudinal
 joints within the travel lanes.
 Construct neat transverse cut off of Aggregates and remove any excess Aggregates from the
 surface prior to resuming operations.
 00710.47 Shaping and Compacting - After the Aggregates have been placed on the Emulsified
 Asphalt, spread or remove all piles, ridges, or uneven distribution to ensure against rough spots in
 the final surface.
 
 Compact the surface with a minimum of two coverages with a pneumatic-tired roller and one
 coverage with a steel-wheeled roller. Continue compacting until the material is interlocked, firm and
 partially bound with the underlying Emulsified Asphalt. The sequence of roller coverages may be
 adjusted at the discretion of the Engineer.

 (g) Taking Aggregates from Agency Stockpiles - When it is specified that Aggregates are to
 be taken from Agency-controlled stockpiles, take the material in an orderly manner. Do not
 contaminate the materials. Salvage all material possible from the area which the material is
 taken. Shape unused portions of a stockpile to Neat Lines. The Contractor will be charged for
 materials wasted through negligence or used without authority.
 (h) Stockpiling Contractor Furnished Aggregates on Agency Property - Aggregates may be
 temporarily stockpiled at approved sites on Agency property provided the areas used are as small
 as practicable. Restore the site to its original condition after the materials have been removed.
 Any contamination during storage or from reloading operations will be cause for rejection.
 00715.11 Emulsified
 Asphalt - Furnish
 polymer-modified
 Emulsified
 Asphalt
 or
 non-polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt as specified for the multiple application Emulsified Asphalt
 surface treatment design designated in the Plans or Special Provisions.
 When
 non-polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt is designated, the Contractor may elect to substitute a
 polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt, however, selection of the polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt
 will not be cause for additional compensation.
 (a) Non-Polymer-Modified Emulsified Asphalt - When non-polymer-modified Emulsified
 Asphalt is specified, use CRS-2 or HFRS-2 Emulsified Asphalt as the Contractor elects.
 (b) Polymer-Modified Emulsified Asphalt - When polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt is
 specified, use CRS-2P or HFRS P1 as the Contractor elects.
 (c) Acceptance of Emulsified Asphalt - Provide Emulsified Asphalt conforming to the
 requirement of ODOT's publication "Standard Specifications for Asphalt Materials". Copies of the
 publication are available from the ODOT Pavement Services Engineer. The applicable
 Specifications are those contained in the current publication on the date the Project is advertised.
 The materials may be conditionally accepted at the source or point of loading for transport to the
 Project.
 
 Excessive delay in the use of the Emulsified Asphalt or excessive pumping of the Emulsified
 Asphalt may significantly reduce the viscosity and may make the material unsuitable for surface
 treatment use. For this reason limit pumping between the bulk storage tank, hauling
 transportation, field storage tanks and distributor to an absolute minimum to maintain proper
 viscosity. Final acceptance of Emulsified Asphalt will be at the point of application.
 Obtain Emulsified Asphalt samples according to AASHTO T 40 at the frequency indicated in the
 MFTP. Samples will be tested at the ODOT Materials Laboratory, or other laboratory as
 designated by the Agency. Non-polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt will be tested within
 30 Calendar Days from the date it is sampled. Polymer-modified Emulsified Asphalt will be tested
 within 14 Calendar Days from the date it is sampled.

 00715.20
 00715.15 Aggregate Production Quality Control - Provide quality control during production of
 Aggregate according to Section 00165. Sampling and Testing shall be performed by a CAgT at the
 minimum frequency schedule indicated in the MFTP.
 (a) Quality Control Compliance - Evaluate Aggregates for compliance according to the
 following:
 (1) Gradation - Analyze gradation statistically according to Section 00165. A stockpile
 contains specification Aggregate when the Pay Factor (PF) for each sieve size calculated
 according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than 1.00. Each required sample represents a
 sublot.
 
 When the results from Table 00165-2 yield a Pay Factor of less than 1.00 for any sieve size,
 the material is non-specification. The Engineer will reject any stockpile of Aggregate
 containing non-specification material unless the non-specification material is removed from the
 stockpile. Do not add additional material to such a stockpile until enough non-specification
 material is removed so that the PF for each sieve size is equal to or greater than 1.00.
 (2) Other Tests - Stop production, make appropriate operational adjustments, and remove all
 failing material from the stockpile whenever a quality control test result, other than sieve
 analysis, does not meet Specifications. Document operational adjustments made and notify
 the Engineer prior to resuming production.
 (3) Preproduced Aggregate - Compliance of Aggregates produced and stockpiled before the
 Award of this Contract will be determined by either one of the following:
 
 • Continuing production records meeting the requirements of 00715.10 and 00715.15.
 • Sampling according to AASHTO T 2 and testing the entire stockpile at the minimum
 frequency schedule indicated in the MFTP. The material shall meet the requirements
 of 00715.10 and 00715.15.
 (b) Materials on Hand - Payment for stockpiled materials on hand may be allowed as described
 in 00195.60 subject to meeting the requirements of 00715.10 and 00715.15.
 00715.16 Acceptance of Aggregate - The Contractors quality control tests will be used for
 acceptance of Aggregates if verified by the Agency's quality assurance program. The Agency will

 * The rates of spread are in the following units:
 Emulsified Asphalt - gallons per square yard
 Aggregates - cubic yards per square yard
 (a) Type E-9 and E-11 Oil Mats - Use one of the following procedures as mutually agreed to by
 the Engineer and Contractor for Type E-9 and E-11 oil mats:
 
 675
 
 00715.43
 • Complete first and second Course (and third Course for Type E-11) of the oil mat
 throughout the entire section (including the dry key) to which the oil mat is to be applied.
 Square up these Courses 3 hours prior to sunset each Day.
 Prior to applying third Course (fourth Course for Type E-11), lightly broom any loose
 Aggregates from surface. Apply third or fourth Course (seal coat) throughout entire section.
 Square up the Courses 3 hours prior to sunset each Day.
 • Square up first and second Course (and third Course for Type E-11) of the oil mat 3 hours
 prior to sunset.
 • The following Day, prior to applying third Course (fourth Course for Type E-11), lightly
 broom any loose Aggregates from surface. Place the third or fourth Course (seal coat) of
 the oil mat and square up 3 hours prior to sunset.
 • Complete all Courses the same Day. Square up all Courses 3 hours prior to sunset.
 (b) Taper at Project Ends - Stop succeeding Courses of each surface treatment 16 feet beyond
 the preceding Course, or as directed by the Engineer, at Project ends to provide a smooth
 transition to the existing Pavement.
 00715.43 Applying Emulsified Asphalt - Apply Emulsified Asphalt at the rates specified
 in 00715.42 and according to the following:
 
 • Apply Emulsified Asphalt, working toward the Aggregate stockpile at all times, unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 • Leave a minimum of 200 gallons of Emulsified Asphalt in the distributor tank at all times.
 • Do not apply Emulsified Asphalt to more than one-half the width of the travel way at one time
 with the remaining width remaining open to traffic. Do not close the open lane until traffic
 controlled by pilot car is operating on the new surface treatment. Apply the surface treatment,
 weather permitting, to both sides of the travel way so that the end of the Work is squared
 up 3 hours before sunset.
 • Do not apply Emulsified Asphalt a greater distance than can be immediately covered by
 Aggregates before the emulsion breaks.
 • Place building paper over the treated surface at the beginning of each spread to ensure that
 the nozzles are operating properly before the uncovered surface is reached. Remove and
 dispose of building paper in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 • If requested by the Engineer, demonstrate that the distribution of the Emulsified Asphalt does
 not vary between the individual nozzles by more than 15 percent transversely from the
 average, and no more than 10 percent longitudinally from the specified rate of application.
 • Apply the Emulsified Asphalt at a temperature between 140 F and 185 F as recommended
 by the manufacturer.
 00715.44 Hauling and Spreading Aggregates - Spread Aggregates at the rates specified
 in 00715.42.
 
 Do not operate hauling and spreading Equipment on uncovered Emulsified Asphalt. During the first
 hour after application of the Emulsified Asphalt and Aggregate, operate at speeds no more than
 10 mph and after the first hour, not more than 15 mph until otherwise allowed by the Engineer.
 Carefully operate hauling Equipment at all times, at moderate speeds that will not damage the new
 surface treatment or create a hazard to the traveling public. Route hauling Equipment and pilot lines
 as uniformly as possible over the full width of the new surface in place.
 
 676
 
 00715.60
 Calibrate the gate opening, gear selection and engine RPM of the chip spreaders for the various
 sizes of Aggregate to be used. Following calibration, verify the rate of application by a method
 acceptable to the Engineer.
 Immediately cover the Emulsified Asphalt surface with Aggregate unless otherwise authorized by
 the Engineer. Maintain the rate of spread of this Aggregate within 10 percent of specified rate.
 Using approved methods, remove or repair Emulsified Asphalt that has set or "broke" before being
 covered with Aggregate, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Aggregates shall be surface damp at the time of application. Excess free water (water not adhering
 to the Aggregate surface) on the Aggregate will not be allowed.
 Do not operate the chip spreader at speeds which cause the chips to roll over after striking the
 emulsion covered surface.
 Provide coverage without gaps or overlapping adjacent coverages. Do not construct longitudinal
 joints within the travel lanes.
 Construct neat transverse cut off of Aggregates and remove any excess Aggregates from the
 surface prior to resuming operations. Stagger cut-offs of successive Courses a minimum of 16 feet
 prior to the end of a proceeding Course.
 00715.45 Shaping and Compacting - After the Aggregates have been placed on the Emulsified
 Asphalt and spread, remove all piles, ridges or uneven distribution to ensure against rough spots in
 the final surface.
 
 Compact the surface with a minimum of four complete coverages immediately behind the chip
 spreader. Perform additional coverages as directed by the Engineer until the material is interlocked,
 firm, and partially bound with the underlying Emulsified Asphalt. The sequence of rollers will be as
 directed by the Engineer.
 Operate rollers at speeds that do not damage the surface. Do not exceed rolling speeds of 5 mph.
 In the event Aggregates begin to pick up under traffic or from the rolling operation, immediately
 cover and roll the area with additional quantities of Aggregate.
 Begin rolling at the low side of the Cross Section and progress with Passes parallel to the roadway
 centerline. Overlap each preceding Pass by at least one half the width of the roller.
 Along curbs, walls and at all other places not accessible to specified rollers, thoroughly compact the
 Aggregate with mechanical tampers or hand tampers. Provide hand tampers with a weight of not
 less than 50 pounds and a tamping face of not more than 0.7 square foot.

 may significantly reduce the viscosity and may make the material unsuitable for tack coat use. For
 this reason limit pumping between the bulk storage tank, hauling transportation, field storage tanks
 and distributor to an absolute minimum to maintain proper viscosity. Final acceptance of Emulsified
 Asphalt will be at the point of application.
 Dilution of the tack coat material may be allowed to a maximum 1:1 ratio. Determine the proportion
 of water to be added to the Emulsified Asphalt. Do not dilute the Emulsified Asphalt until the
 Engineer approves the dilution ratio. Add the water to the Emulsified Asphalt and mix according to
 the asphalt Supplier.
 Obtain samples according to AASHTO T 40 prior to dilution with water, if allowed, at the frequency
 indicated in the MFTP. Samples will be tested at the ODOT Materials Laboratory, or other
 laboratory as designated by the Agency. Emulsified Asphalt will be tested within 30 Calendar Days
 from the date it is sampled.

 at one time. The remaining width shall remain open to traffic. Do not close the open lane until traffic
 controlled by pilot car is operating on the new surface.
 00730.42 Preparation of Underlying Surfaces - Immediately before applying the tack coat, the
 surface to be tacked shall be clean and dry. Clean all loose material by brooming, flushing with
 water or other approved methods.
 00730.44 Applying Tack Coat - Apply the Emulsified Asphalt with a pressure distributor
 conforming to 00730.22, unless otherwise allowed. Apply the Emulsified Asphalt to the prepared
 surface at a rate between 0.05 and 0.20 gallons per square yard as directed and with the Emulsified
 Asphalt temperature between 140 F and 185 F as recommended by the manufacturer. Application
 rates for tack coat diluted according to 00730.11 will be increased as necessary to provide the same
 amount of residual asphalt as the application rates specified above.
 
 Do not place hot mixed asphalt concrete Pavement or Emulsified Asphalt Concrete Pavement on
 the tack coat until the Emulsified Asphalt separates from the water (breaks), but before it loses its
 tackiness.

 area or width of a Traffic Lane. On Median lanes and on Shoulder areas, construct joints only
 at lane lines or at points of change in the transverse slopes, as shown or as directed.
 (b) Drop-Offs:
 
 • Provide warning signs and markings according to Section 00225 where abrupt or sloped
 edge drop-offs 1 inch or more in height occur.
 • Protect edges from being broken down.
 • If unable to complete the Pavement without drop-offs according to 00735.48(c):
 • Construct and maintain a wedge of EAC at a Slope of 1V:10H or flatter along the
 exposed longitudinal joint.
 • Remove and dispose of the wedge before continuing paving operations.

 the Agency. EAC for the temporary wedge will be paid for at the Pay Item price.
 (c) Placing EAC Under Traffic - When placing EAC Pavement under traffic, schedule Work for
 the nominal thickness being laid as follows or as required by the Special Provisions:
 (1) More Than 2 inches - Schedule Work so at the end of each working shift the full width of
 the area being paved, including Shoulders, is completed to the same elevation with no
 longitudinal drop-offs.
 (2) More Than 1 inch But Not More Than 2 inches - Schedule Work so at the end of each
 working shift one Panel of new travel lane Pavement does not extend beyond the adjoining
 Panel of new travel lane Pavement more than the distance normally covered by each shift. At
 the end of each workweek complete the full width of the area to be paved, including Shoulders,
 to the same elevation with no longitudinal drop-offs.
 00735.49 Transverse Joints - Construct transverse joints according to the following:
 (a) Travel Lanes - Construct transverse joints on the travel lane portion of all specified
 Pavement Courses, except Leveling Courses, as follows:
 (1) Project Ends - Construct transverse joints at Project ends as shown or as directed.
 (2) Temporary End Panel - Maintain Pavement depth, line and grade at least 5 feet beyond
 the selected transverse joint location, and from that point wedge down on the appropriate
 Slope until it meets the surface beneath the EAC, assuming a Pavement Course thickness
 of 2 inches, as follows:
 
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for less than 24 hours, the wedge length shall be
 8 feet (1V:50H taper rate).
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for 24 hours or longer, the wedge length shall be
 25 feet (1V:160H taper rate).
 When the Pavement Course thickness is different than the above 2 inch example, use the
 appropriate taper rate to compute the length of the wedge. The wedge length plus the 5 feet
 or longer Panel form the "temporary end Panel".
 (3) Vertical Face - After the mixture has reached the required density:
 
 • Provide a smooth, vertical face the full depth of the Course being laid at the location
 selected for the joint by sawing, cutting or other approved methods.
 • Remove EAC material from the joint to the end of the Panel. If removed before resuming
 paving beyond the joint, reconstruct the temporary end Panel immediately by placing a
 bond-breaker of paper, dust or other suitable material against the vertical face and on the
 surface to be occupied by the temporary end Panel. Construct a full-depth Panel at
 least 5 feet long, beginning at the sawed or cut joint, and taper it according
 to 00735.49(a)(2) to zero thickness.
 (4) Excess EAC - After completing a temporary end Panel as specified, dispose of the
 unused remainder of EAC as directed. Payment will be made for the entire load of EAC, but
 will be limited to one load only per joint per Panel.

 temperatures.
 Materials
 00744.10 Aggregate - Furnish new Aggregate, RAP Aggregate, and RAS Aggregate meeting the
 following requirements:
 (a) New Coarse and Fine Aggregates - Produce coarse and fine Aggregate from crushed Rock
 or other inert material of similar characteristics.
 
 Blend sand is allowed for Levels 1, 2, and 3 mixes. Do not use more than 6 percent natural or
 uncrushed blend sand, by weight, in the total Aggregate. Provide a means of verifying and
 documenting the amount of blend sand added to the Aggregate.
 Testing of Aggregates for soundness, durability, and harmful substances will be at the discretion
 and expense of the Agency.
 704
 
 00744.10

 (b) Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement - RAP material used in the production of new ACP is
 optional. No more than 30 percent RAP material will be allowed in the new ACP Pavement. Use
 RAP Aggregates in the ACP that are no larger than the specified maximum allowable Aggregate
 size before entering the cold feed. Blend the RAP material with new Aggregate to provide a
 mixture conforming to the JMF within the tolerances specified.
 (c) Recycled Asphalt Shingles - RAS used in the production of new ACP is optional. Either
 manufacturer waste (post-manufacturer) RAS or tear-off (post-consumer) RAS may be used.
 Manufacturer waste RAS is processed asphalt shingle material derived from manufacturer's
 shingle scrap. Tear-off RAS is processed asphalt shingle material derived from shingle scrap
 removed from Structures. All percentages are based upon dry weights for calculations.
 (1) Processing Shingles - Process the RAS by grinding at ambient temperature so
 that 100 percent of the shredded pieces are less than 1/2 inch in any dimension and that
 90 percent are less than 3/8 inch in any dimension when sampled according to AASHTO T 2
 and tested according to AASHTO T 27. Sample and test the processed RAS for gradation at a
 frequency of one test for every 50 tons of RAS processed.
 
 705
 
 00744.11
 (2) Harmful Substances - Certify that the RAS does not contain asbestos fibers according to
 the policies and procedures established by the Department of Environmental Quality. Test
 deleterious materials according to ODOT TM 335 at a frequency of one test for every 50 tons
 of RAS material. Limit the percentage of deleterious materials to 1.0 percent. If fine
 Aggregate is added as an anti-clumping agent, sample and test processed RAS for harmful
 substances before adding the fine Aggregates.
 (3) Anti-Clumping Additive - Fine Aggregate meeting the requirements of 00744.10(a) may
 be added to the RAS in a quantity not to exceed 4 percent by weight of RAS to keep the
 material workable and to prevent conglomeration of the shingle particles in the stockpile.
 Include these added fine Aggregates in the mix design. RAS may also be blended with RAP
 in controlled percentages to preclude clumping. Do not contaminate stockpiled RAS with dirt
 or other foreign materials.
 (4) Allowable Percentages - No more than 5.0 percent RAS by total weight of Aggregate is
 allowed in ACP mixtures. Restrict the maximum allowable percentage of asphalt binder
 replacement to 20.0 percent for Base Courses and 15.0 percent for wearing Courses in ACP
 containing only RAS.
 
 When RAS is used in conjunction with RAP, restrict the maximum allowable percentage of
 binder replacement to 30.0 percent for Base Courses and 25.0 percent for wearing Courses.
 (5) Establishing Mix Design Inputs - For ACP mixtures containing RAS or RAM, following
 any addition of fine Aggregate as an anti-clumping agent, test the material according to
 ODOT TM 319 to establish the asphalt content, material specific gravities, and gradation.
 Develop mixture designs according to the ODOT Contractor Mix Design Guidelines for Asphalt
 Concrete.
 
 Blend the RAS or RAM with new Aggregate to provide a mixture conforming to the JMF within
 the tolerances specified.
 00744.11 Asphalt Cement and Additives - Furnish the following asphalt cement and additives:

 Special Provisions.
 (b) Asphalt Cement Additives - Use standard recognized asphalt cement additive products that
 are of known value for the intended purpose and approved for use on the basis of laboratory tests
 and capable of being thoroughly mixed. Do not use asphalt cement additives that have
 detrimental effects on the asphalt material. Do not use silicones as an additive. Add the
 following asphalt cement additives when required by the JMF:
 
 • Anti-stripping asphalt cement additives to prevent stripping or separation of asphalt coatings
 from Aggregates to satisfy the TSR specified in 00744.13.
 • Asphalt cement admixtures used to aid in the mixing or use of asphalt mixes or for
 experimental purposes.
 When WMAC is used, select one of the WMAC technologies and process and additive types
 identified on ODOT's publication "Approved WMAC Technologies".

 • Down - If the Aggregate coating, moisture content, workability and compaction requirements
 are attained.
 
 710
 
 00744.44
 00744.42 Tack Coat - Construct a tack coat before placing each Lift of ACP according to
 Section 00730. A tack coat is not required before placing ACP on Aggregate Base.
 
 Treat all paved surfaces on and against which ACP is to be placed with an asphalt tack coat
 according to Section 00730. Before applying the tack coat, clean and dry the surface to be tacked.
 Remove all loose material that will reduce adhesion of the tack by brooming, flushing with water, or
 other approved methods.
 00744.43 Hauling, Depositing, and Placing - Haul, deposit, and place ACP according to the
 following:
 (a) Hauling - Cover ACP if rain is encountered any time between loading and placement.
 
 ACP will be rejected before placing if one or more of the following occurs:
 • Below temperature limit specified in 00744.41.
 • Slumping or separating.
 • Solidifying.
 Dispose of rejected loads at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Deliver the mixture to the paving machine at a rate that provides continuous operation of the
 paving machine, except for unavoidable delay or breakdown. If excessive stopping of the paving
 machine occurs during paving operations, the Engineer may suspend paving operations until the
 mixture delivery rate matches the paving machine operation.
 (b) Depositing - Deposit ACP from the hauling vehicles so segregation is prevented.
 (c) Placing - Alternative equipment and means may be allowed by the Engineer if the use of a
 paver is impractical.
 
 Do not place ACP during rain or other adverse weather conditions, unless allowed by the
 Engineer. ACP in transit at the time adverse conditions occur may be placed if:
 • It has been covered during transit.
 • The ACP temperature is satisfactory.
 • It is placed on a foundation free from pools or flow of water.
 Place the mixture in the number of Lifts and Courses, and to the compacted thickness for each
 Lift and Course, as shown. Place each Course in one Lift unless otherwise specified. Do not
 exceed a compacted thickness of 4 inches for any Lift. Limit the minimum Lift thickness to twice
 the maximum Aggregate size in the mix.
 00744.44 Longitudinal Joints - At longitudinal joints, bond, compact and finish the new ACP equal
 to the ACP against which it is placed.
 (a) Location - Place the ACP in Panel widths which hold the number of longitudinal joints to a
 minimum. Offset the longitudinal joints in one Panel by at least 6 inches from the longitudinal
 joints in the Panel immediately below.
 
 711
 
 00744.45
 (1) Base Course - Place Base Course longitudinal joints within 12 inches of the edge of a
 lane, or within 12 inches of the center of a lane, except in irregular areas, unless otherwise
 shown.
 (2) Wearing Course - Construct longitudinal joints at either lane lines or fog lines, or as
 shown or directed.
 (b) Drop-Offs:
 
 • Provide warning signs and markings according to Section 00225 where abrupt or sloped
 edge drop-offs 1 inch or more in height occur.
 • Protect edges from being broken down.
 If unable to complete the Pavement without drop-offs according to 00744.44(c) do the following:
 • Construct and maintain a wedge of ACP at a Slope of 1V:10H or flatter along the exposed
 longitudinal joint.
 • Remove and dispose of the wedge before continuing paving operations.
 • Construct, maintain, remove, and dispose of the temporary wedge at no additional cost to
 the Agency. ACP for the temporary wedge will be paid for at the Pay Item price.
 (c) Placing Under Traffic - When placing ACP Pavement under traffic, schedule Work for the
 nominal thickness being laid as follows:
 (1) More Than 2 Inches - Schedule Work so at the end of each working shift the full width of
 the area being paved, including Shoulders, is completed to the same elevation with no
 longitudinal drop-offs, unless approved.
 (2) Less Than or Equal to 2 Inches - Schedule Work so that at the end of each working shift
 one Panel of new travel lane Pavement does not extend beyond the adjoining Panel of new
 travel lane Pavement more than the distance normally covered by each shift. At the end of
 each week complete the full width of the area to be paved, including Shoulders, to the same
 elevation with no longitudinal drop-offs.
 00744.45 Transverse Joints:
 (a) Travel Lanes - Construct transverse joints on the travel lane portion of all specified
 Pavement Courses, except Leveling Courses, as follows:
 (1) Temporary End Panel - Maintain Pavement depth, line and grade at least 4 feet beyond
 the selected transverse joint location, and from that point, wedge down on the appropriate
 Slope until the top of the Course being laid meets the underlying surface (assuming a
 Pavement Course thickness of 2 inches) as follows:
 
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for less than 24 hours, construct an 8 foot long
 wedge (1V:50H taper rate).
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for 24 hours or longer, construct a 25 foot long
 wedge (1V:160H taper rate).
 • Construct, maintain, remove, and dispose of the temporary wedge at no additional cost to
 the Agency. ACP for the temporary wedge will be paid for at the Pay Item price.
 
 712
 
 00744.49
 When the Pavement Course thickness is different than the above 2 inch example, use the
 appropriate taper rate to compute the length of the wedge. The wedge length plus the 4 feet
 or longer Panel form the temporary end Panel.
 (2) Vertical Face - After the mixture has reached the required density:
 
 • Provide a smooth, vertical face the full depth of the Course being laid at the location
 selected for the joint by sawing, cutting or other approved method.
 • Remove the ACP material from the joint to the end of the Panel. If removed before
 resuming paving beyond the joint, reconstruct the temporary end Panel immediately by
 placing a bond-breaker of paper, dust, or other suitable material against the vertical face
 and on the surface to be occupied by the temporary end Panel. Construct a full-depth
 Panel at least 4 feet long, beginning at the sawed or cut joint, and taper it on a 1V:50H
 Slope to zero thickness.
 (3) Excess Asphalt Concrete Pavement - After completing a temporary end Panel as
 specified, dispose of unused, remaining ACP as directed. Payment will be made for the entire
 load of ACP, but will be limited to only one load for each joint of each Panel.
 (4) Resume Paving - When permanent paving resumes, remove the temporary end Panel
 and any bond-breakers. Clean the surface of all debris and apply a tack coat to the vertical
 edge and the surface to be paved.
 (5) Joint Requirements - Compact both sides of the joint to the specified density. When
 tested with a straightedge placed across the joint, the joint surface shall conform to 00744.70.
 (b) Abutting Bridge Ends - Compact the ACP abutting bridge ends and other rigid type
 Structures in the longitudinal direction and either transverse or diagonal direction, as directed.
 (c) Bridge Deck Overlays - Saw cut the wearing Course of Pavement directly over the joints in
 bridge decks, bridge end joints and end Panel end joints as soon as practical but within 48 hours
 of paving each stage of the wearing Course, unless otherwise directed. Saw cut a 3/8 inch wide,

 allowed in ACP mixtures. Restrict the maximum allowable percentage of asphalt binder
 replacement to 20.0 percent for Base Courses and 15.0 percent for wearing Courses in ACP
 containing only RAS.
 
 When RAS is used in conjunction with RAP, restrict the maximum allowable percentage of
 binder replacement to 30.0 percent for Base Courses and 25.0 percent for wearing Courses.
 (5) Establishing Mix Design Inputs - For ACP mixtures containing RAS or RAM, following
 any addition of fine Aggregate as an anti-clumping agent, test the material according to
 ODOT TM 319 to establish the asphalt content, material specific gravities, and gradation.
 Develop mixture designs according to the ODOT Contractor Mix Design Guidelines for Asphalt
 Concrete. Additional testing may be requested by the Agency or the Contractor at any time
 during the production of the RAS or RAM mixture to verify the amount of asphalt cement in the
 RAS or RAM. Conduct new tests by a laboratory mutually agreed upon by the Agency and the
 Contractor. The party requesting the additional testing pays the cost of the additional testing.

 725
 
 00745.16
 (5) Plant Calibration - Calibrate all meters and belt scales at the ACP mixing plant according
 to ODOT TM 322 before beginning production.
 (b) Mix Design Verification:
 (1) Mix Design Verification Quality Control:
 a. General - Before beginning production and placement of WMAC, perform mix design
 verification (MDV) tests on the HMAC as required at start-up according to 00745.16(b)(1)(d).
 Two consecutive MDV test results from testing of HMAC shall be within the limits
 of 00745.16(b)(1)(a). The Engineer may waive ODOT TM 306 for HMAC production
 required before WMAC production for one shift.
 
 Perform MDV tests on every sublot and as required at start up according
 to 00745.16(b)(1)(d) and the MFTP. Perform gradation and asphalt content testing with

 b. Laboratory Compactor Selection - Use the equivalent laboratory compactor for MDV
 as used to develop the JMF.
 c. Reconciliation of Laboratory and In-place Properties - Have a CDT provide the
 results from the initial control strip to the CAT-II for evaluation and comparison with the MDV
 results at the completion of the control strip. If the MDV and density test results are
 contradictory, inform the Engineer and initiate an investigation.
 The CAT-II shall
 recommend a plan to the Engineer for resolving the discrepancy based on the results of the
 investigation. Submit results of investigation and plan no later than the end of two shifts
 after investigation has been initiated.
 d. Mix Design Verification Requirements at Start-Up - Perform MDV testing at the
 start-up of the JMF production according to the following process:
 1. Obtain a sample in the first 100 tons of production and immediately perform MDV
 testing.
 
 726
 
 00745.16
 2. If the Va and VMA mix properties of 00745.16(b)(1)(a) are within tolerance, then
 continue subsequent MDV testing at the established random QC sublot interval. If not,
 then go to step "3".
 3. If the Va and VMA mix properties are out of tolerance in 00745.16(b)(1)(a), then make
 mix adjustments within the requirements of 00745.16(b)(1)(e) and immediately obtain
 another sample and perform MDV testing. Two adjustments will be given. If any of the
 test results for Va and VMA are not within the limits of 00745.16(b)(1)(a) after second
 adjustment, then stop production and go to step "4".
 4. Have the CAT-II submit the revised JMF targets and production and plant adjustments
 to the Engineer. Obtain the approval of the Engineer before restarting production.
 Production will be restarted with MDV testing according to this subsection.
 
 Use the initial MDV sample as the first random QC sublot test. Subsequent MDV samples
 required due to failure of start-up criteria will be used for a sublot QC test if the sample is
 taken within 100 tons of the scheduled random QC sample location. If not, perform the
 MDV testing separate from, and not included in, the random QC testing program. Complete
 all required MDV testing at no additional cost to the Agency.
 e. Corrective Action - Take corrective action when required by the MDV start-up process
 of 00745.16(b)(1)(d). After the requirements of 00745.16(b)(1)(d) have been met, take
 corrective action if the MDV test results show that two consecutive running averages of four
 samples are outside the limits for air voids, VMA, VFA, or P No. 200/Pbe ratio according
 to 00745.16(b)(1)(a). Document the corrective action and submit to the Engineer. If the
 subsequent MDV test results following the corrective action are outside the limits
 of 00745.16(b)(1)(a), immediately stop production and make adjustments.
 Restart
 production according to 00745.16(b)(1)(d) only after the Engineer has approved the
 proposed adjustments. If the MDV test results are outside the limits of 00745.16(b)(1)(a),
 but the mixture meets the current requirements for gradation and asphalt content, an
 adjustment to the JMF targets is required. A new lot is not required as a result of the
 adjustment.
 f. Field Tensile Strength Ratio Testing - Perform a Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) test
 according to AASHTO T 283 on a sample obtained during the first 2 days of production after
 QC test results verify that ACP constituents with a weighting factor greater than one
 according to 00745.95 are in tolerance. Provide test results to the Engineer within
 6 Calendar Days of obtaining the sample. Stop production and make adjustments if the
 TSR is less than 70. Restart production only after the Engineer has approved the proposed
 adjustments.
 
 The Engineer may waive Field TSR testing if the Contractor provides Field TSR data dated
 within the prior 3 months of the first MDV sample.
 g. Request for Job Mix Formula Target Adjustment - A request for an adjustment to the
 JMF targets may be made to the Engineer by the Contractor's CAT-II. The requested
 change will be reviewed and documented by the Engineer. If acceptable, a revised JMF will
 be allowed. Document the sublot test for which the adjusted targets are in effect. When
 making adjustments for gradation do not exceed the tolerances specified for the original
 JMF limits. Keep AC content adjustments for HMAC within 0.5 percent of the original JMF.
 Keep AC content adjustments for WMAC within 0.3 percent of the original JMF. The JMF
 asphalt content may only be adjusted if the production VMA meets the requirements
 of 00745.16(b)(1)(a). Keep adjustments for RAP or RAM within 5 percent of the original
 JMF blend percentage, but do not exceed the requirements of 00745.10(b) or 00745.10(c).
 Adjusting proportions of the combined RAP and RAS will not be allowed during production
 
 727
 
 00745.17
 of the mixture. Keep adjustments for RAS content within 1 percent of the original JMF, but
 do not exceed the requirements of 00745.10(c). A gradation adjustment is required if the
 VMA is outside of the 00745.16(b)(1)(a) limits. Regardless of these tolerances, keep the
 adjusted JMF within the mixture specification control points of 00745.12. If a redesign of the
 mixture becomes necessary, submit a new JMF according to the requirements of these
 Specifications.
 (2) Mix Design Verification Quality Assurance - The Engineer will observe and document
 the Contractor's performing of MDV test procedures and calculations. Immediately correct any
 deviations from the specified test procedures. The Engineer may conduct MDV assurance
 testing at any time.
 (3) Mix Design Verification for Warm Mix Asphalt Concrete - Perform MDV testing on
 WMAC according to 00745.16(b)(1)(a). Continued production and placement of WMAC will be
 allowed at the discretion of the Engineer.
 (c) Quality Assurance and Acceptance - The Agency will provide quality assurance according
 to Section 00165. When QA testing is performed, the Contractor's quality control results will be
 used for acceptance if they are within acceptable limits of the QA test results as defined by
 ODOT's Quality Assurance Program.
 00745.17 Small Quantity Acceptance - When the quantity of ACP in a lot is less than 2,500 tons,
 the Engineer may accept the ACP according to Section 4(B) of the MFTP or by test results
 according to the following:
 (a) Within Specification Limits - If all sublot sample test results are within specification limits for
 all constituents, including compaction, the material will be accepted and the full Bid price will be
 paid for the material represented by that test.
 (b) Outside Specification Limits - If a sublot sample test result for any constituent is outside
 the specification limit the Engineer will have the backup sample tested.
 (1) Backup Within Specifications - If the backup sample test results for all constituents are
 within specification, the material will be accepted and the full Bid price will be paid for the
 material represented by that test.
 (2) Backup Out of Specifications - If the backup sample test results are out of specification,
 the Contractor may choose to accept the price adjustment calculated according to 00745.95 or
 may choose to sample the in-place material for further testing according to 00745.17(b)(3).
 The price adjustments will be computed using all original test results as well as all backup test
 results. If there are less than three tests, average the two tests and use the average as a third
 test result. The maximum composite pay factor (CPF) will be 1.0.
 (3) In-Place Samples - If the Contractor chooses to sample the in-place material, sample
 from a minimum of three random locations from the area represented by the lot in question
 under the observation of the Engineer. If the in-place sample test results are within
 specification, the material will be accepted and paid for at the full Bid price. If the in-place
 sample test results are not within specification, the material will be accepted and paid for at an
 adjusted price according to 00745.95. The maximum CPF will be 1.0. Perform sampling and
 testing of in-place material at no additional cost to the Agency.

 the Agency. ACP for the temporary wedge will be paid for at the Pay Item price.
 (c) Placing Under Traffic - When placing ACP Pavement under traffic, schedule Work for the
 nominal thickness being laid as follows:
 (1) More Than 2 inches - Schedule Work so at the end of each working shift the full width of
 the area being paved, including Shoulders, is completed to the same elevation with no
 longitudinal drop-offs.
 (2) Less Than or Equal to 2 Inches - Schedule Work so that at the end of each working shift
 one Panel of new travel lane Pavement does not extend beyond the adjoining Panel of new
 travel lane Pavement more than the distance normally covered by each shift. At the end of
 each week complete the full width of the area to be paved, including Shoulders, to the same
 elevation with no longitudinal drop-offs.
 00745.48 Transverse Joints:
 (a) Travel Lanes - Construct transverse joints on the travel lane portion of all specified
 Pavement Courses, except Leveling Courses, as follows:
 (1) Temporary End Panel - Maintain Pavement depth, line and grade at least 4 feet beyond
 the selected transverse joint location, and from that point, wedge down on the appropriate
 Slope until the top of the Course being laid meets the underlying surface (assuming a
 Pavement Course thickness of 2 inches) as follows:
 
 734
 
 00745.49
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for less than 24 hours, construct an 8 foot long
 wedge (1V:50H taper rate).
 • For wedges that will be under traffic for 24 hours or longer, construct a 25 foot long
 wedge (1V:160H taper rate).
 • Construct, maintain, remove, and dispose of the temporary wedge at no additional cost to
 the Agency. ACP for the temporary wedge will be paid for at the Pay Item price.
 When the Pavement Course thickness is different than the above 2 inch example, use the
 appropriate taper rate to compute the length of the wedge. The wedge length plus the 4 feet
 or longer Panel form the temporary end Panel.
 (2) Vertical Face - After the mixture has reached the required density:
 
 • Provide a smooth, vertical face the full depth of the Course being laid at the location
 selected for the joint by sawing, cutting or other approved method.
 • Remove the ACP material from the joint to the end of the Panel. If removed before
 resuming paving beyond the joint, reconstruct the temporary end Panel immediately by
 placing a bond-breaker of paper, dust, or other suitable material against the vertical face
 and on the surface to be occupied by the temporary end Panel. Construct a full-depth
 Panel at least 4 feet long, beginning at the sawed or cut joint, and taper it on a 1V:50H
 Slope to zero thickness.
 (3) Excess Asphalt Concrete Pavement - After completing a temporary end Panel as
 specified, dispose of unused, remaining ACP as directed. Payment will be made for the entire
 load of ACP, but will be limited to only one load for each joint of each Panel.
 (4) Resume Paving - When permanent paving resumes, remove the temporary end Panel
 and any bond-breakers. Clean the surface of all debris and apply a tack coat to the vertical
 edge and the surface to be paved.
 (5) Joint Requirements - Compact both sides of the joint to the specified density. When
 tested with a straightedge placed across the joint, the joint surface shall conform to 00745.70.
 (b) Abutting Bridge Ends - Compact the ACP abutting bridge ends and other rigid type
 Structures in the longitudinal direction and either transverse or diagonal direction, as directed.
 (c) Bridge Deck Overlays - Saw cut the wearing Course of Pavement directly over the joints in
 bridge decks, bridge end joints and end Panel end joints as soon as practical but within 48 hours
 of paving each stage of the wearing Course, unless otherwise directed. Saw the cut 3/8 inch
 wide,  1/8 inch, by 1/2 inch less than the thickness of the Panel of Pavement depth
 or 1 1/2 inches deep, whichever is less.
 
 Flush the saw cut thoroughly with a high-pressure water stream after the cut has been made.
 Before the cut dries out, blow it free of water and debris with compressed air. Fill the joint with a
 poured filler from the QPL.
 00745.49 Compaction:
 (a) General - After the ACP has been spread, struck off, and surface irregularities and other
 defects remedied, roll it uniformly until compacted as specified.
 (1) Temperature - Complete breakdown and intermediate compaction before the ACP
 temperature drops below 180 F, unless otherwise directed or required based on the control
 
 735
 
 00745.49
 strip. For WMAC, complete breakdown and intermediate compaction before the WMAC
 temperature drops below 160 °F. When the rolling causes tearing, displacement, cracking or
 shoving, make necessary changes in compaction temperature, type of compaction Equipment,
 and rolling procedures.
 (2) Rolling - Provide sufficient rollers of the types appropriate to compact the mixture while it
 is still within the specified temperature. Do not use equipment which crushes the Aggregate.
 Do not displace the line and grade of edges. Moisten steel roller wheels with a minimum
 amount of water, or other approved material, necessary to prevent the ACP from sticking to
 them and spotting or defacing the ACP.
 
 Operate rollers at a slow, uniform speed recommended by the manufacturer. Drive rolls or
 wheels shall be nearest the paver unless otherwise approved. Operate pneumatic rollers no
 faster than 3 mph. Operate vibratory rollers at frequencies of at least 2,000 vibrations per
 minute.
 Begin rolling at the sides and proceed longitudinally, parallel to the road centerline, gradually
 progressing to the center, unless otherwise directed. On superelevated curves, begin rolling at
 the low side and progress to the high side. When paving in echelon, or when abutting a
 previously placed lane, roll the longitudinal joint first, followed by the regular rolling pattern. Do
 not make sharp turns or park rollers on hot ACP. Stop each Pass at least 5 feet longitudinally
 from preceding stops.
 Perform finish rolling with rollers meeting the requirements of 00745.24(a) or 00745.24(b), and
 continue until all roller marks are eliminated.
 (b) Normal Pavement (Nominal Thickness 2 Inches or Greater):
 (1) General - Compliance with the density Specifications for ACP shall be determined by
 random testing of the compacted road surface with calibrated nuclear gauges. Use the MAMD
 method of compaction measurement.
 
 Construct a control strip at the beginning of Work on each JMF on the Project according to
 ODOT TM 306. The purpose of the control strip is to determine the maximum density that can
 be achieved for the JMF, paving conditions, and Equipment on the Project. Additional control
 strips are necessary when there is a change in compaction Equipment or when JMF targets
 are adjusted according to 00745.16(b)(1)(a). The Engineer may waive the control strip for
 irregular areas or areas too small to establish a reasonable roller pattern.
 Stop paving if three consecutive control strips fail to achieve the specified density. Take all
 actions necessary to resolve compaction problems. Do not resume paving until allowed by the
 Engineer.
 A pneumatic tired roller is not required for Level 1 and Level 2 ACP. Have at least one
 available pneumatic tired roller conforming to 00745.24(c) on the Project and in good operating
 condition for Level 3 and Level 4 ACP.
 Have the CDT notify the Engineer and CAT-II when the average density for a sublot exceeds
 95 percent of MAMD. Initiate an investigation to determine if the results indicate that a
 problem with the mix is developing. An adjustment to the JMF will not be allowed unless MDV
 testing supports a required change.
 (2) Random Testing - Determine the density of each sublot by averaging five QC tests
 performed at random locations with the nuclear gauge operated in the backscatter mode. Lots
 
 736
 
 00745.49
 and sublots shall correspond with those defined in 00745.02. In addition, perform at least one
 density test each Day of production. The additional testing may be waived by the Engineer.
 a. Testing - After completion of the finish rolling, test according to AASHTO T 355. Do not
 locate the center of a density test less than 1 foot from the Panel edge. Complete density
 testing before traffic is allowed on the new mat.
 b. Core Correlation of Nuclear Gauge Readings - Correlate each nuclear gauge on the
 Project for each Lift when requested or required. Perform core correlations and determine
 core correlation factors according to AASHTO T 355 and ODOT TM 327. Provide bulk
 specific gravity values to the Engineer within 24 hours of coring. If an Aggregate source or
 the asphalt cement source changes, new core correlations are required.
 
 Apply correlation factors to all nuclear gauge readings for the Lift on which the core
 correlation was performed.
 Both the Engineer and the Contractor may request additional core correlation of nuclear
 gauge readings. Core correlations requested by the Contractor or that are required due to a
 change in Aggregate or asphalt cement source will be at no additional cost to the Agency.
 The party requesting the core correlation pays the costs of coring and lab testing of the
 cores. The party performing nuclear gauge testing pays the costs of the nuclear gauge
 testing.
 (3) Moving Average Maximum Density Method - The MAMD is the average of the current
 MDT and, if available, the four previous MDT's for the JMF used. Determine each MDT using
 the Gmm determined according to AASHTO T 209 and calculate the MAMD according to
 ODOT TM 305.
 
 When this method is used, compact the ACP to at least the percent of the MAMD applicable
 for the mix type and Lift as follows:
 Course of Construction
 
 ACP
 
 First ACP Lift less than 3 inches placed on Aggregate Base
 All other
 
 91.0 *
 92.0
 
 * If any part of the width of a Lift at a station requires 91.0 percent, then the
 entire width of that Lift at that station shall be 91.0 percent
 (4) Test Results - Provide density results for the completed sublots to the Engineer by the
 middle of the following working shift.
 (c) Thin Pavement - Compaction to a specified density will not be required for Leveling, patches,
 or where the nominal compacted thickness of a Course of ACP will be less than 2 inches.
 
 Perform breakdown and intermediate rolling until the entire surface has been compacted by at
 least four coverages of the rollers. Perform additional coverages, as directed, to obtain finish
 rolling of the ACP.
 (d) Other Areas - Compaction to a specified density will not be required on temporary Surfacing,
 guardrail flares, mailbox turnouts, road approaches, Pavement repair, and areas less than 8 feet
 wide or limited length, regardless of thickness. Compact these surfaces according to 00749.45.
 (e) Bridge Decks and End Panels - Compaction to a specified density will not be required for
 ACP placed on bridge decks and end Panels. Perform the same rolling pattern, without vibration,
 as established by 00745.49(b)(1).
 In the absence of a rolling pattern established
 
 737
 
 00745.50
 by 00745.49(b)(1), perform breakdown and intermediate rolling until the entire surface has been
 compacted by at least six coverages of the rollers. Perform additional coverages, as directed, to
 obtain finish rolling of the ACP.
 Temporary
 00745.50 Temporary Surfacing Course - Provide ACP for temporary Surfacing that is a
 well-graded, uniform, durable commercial mix. All new materials, or a combination of new materials
 and reclaimed materials, may be used, according to 00745.10(b). The Contractor is responsible for
 the quality of material furnished according to Section 00165 and for maintaining the surface in a
 condition appropriate for the facility. Mix used for temporary Surfacing will not be eligible for price
 adjustment under 00745.95.

 separate measurement being made for the asphalt concrete mixture and the asphalt cement
 contained in the mixture. No deduction will be made for lime or any other additive used in the
 mixture.
 
 When RAP, RAS, or RAM materials are used, measurement of the total asphalt quantity will be
 based on quality control tests averaged at least to the nearest 0.01 percent. For mixtures not
 containing RAP, RAS or RAM materials, measurement of the total asphalt quantity will be based on
 quality control tests averaged at least to the nearest 0.01 percent when the Engineer determines
 that payment by invoice and tank sticking is impracticable.
 If an estimated bulk specific gravity for the Aggregates is shown in the Special Provisions, determine
 the actual bulk specific gravity for the Aggregates, recompute the quantities of ACP to be used, and
 inform the Agency in writing. The quantities of ACP will be adjusted accordingly with no adjustment
 in Contract unit prices. The provisions of 00140.20 and 00195.20 will apply.
 When listed in the Contract Schedule of Items, extra or additional Work for approaches, driveways,
 walks, and other miscellaneous Structures will be measured according to 00749.80
 through 00749.82.
 If there is no separate item listed in the Contract Scheduled of Items for Leveling Work, the
 quantities will be included in the appropriate ACP items.
 Payment
 00745.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of ACP incorporated into the Project, whether or not
 recycled Materials are used, will be paid for at the Contract unit price, per unit of measurement, for
 the following items:
 Pay Item

 When indicated by other Pay Items in the Contract Schedule of Items, separate payment will be
 made for Work described in 00745.42, 00749.91 and 00749.92.
 When a Panel consists of both temporary and permanent Courses, payment for the entire Panel will
 be based on the permanent Course.
 Anti-stripping asphalt cement additives will be paid for at the Contractor's actual documented costs
 with no percentage allowance or markup allowed. No additional payment will be made for antistripping additives or treatments that are not anti-stripping asphalt cement additives.
 00745.95 Price Adjustments - The Composite Pay Factor (CPF), calculated according
 to 00165.40, 00745.16, and 00745.95, will be applied to the Contract unit price for Pay Items (a) and
 (b) of 00745.90 and to the applicable lot quantities. The CPF will be made available to the
 Contractor within 24 hours of receipt of the required quality control test results. If less than three
 samples are tested, the CPF will be computed as outlined in 00745.17 and 00745.95, the maximum
 CPF for material represented by less than three samples will be 1.0.
 
 To accommodate the lot definition of 00745.02, interpret the upper specification limit (USL) and the
 lower specification limit (LSL) in 00165.40 to allow adjustments to a JMF according to 00745.16
 without changing lots. Include all material from the original JMF and revisions of that JMF in the
 statistical analysis unless a change in the lot is required by 00745.02. If JMF target values are
 modified according to 00745.16, the CPF will be calculated in the following manner:
 • The adjusted target value will be evaluated as zero with the USL and LSL representing the
 allowable tolerances of 00745.14. All sample test values for the changed constituents will be
 compared to the target for each sublot. The differences between the target values and sample
 test values are the adjusted sample test values for each sublot. These will be analyzed for
 determination of the pay factor for the constituent.
 The Pay Factor (PF) for compaction will be:

 designs for each class of concrete required according to Section 02001.
 00755.15 Quality Control - Provide quality control according to Section 00165, Section 02001, and
 the following:
 
 751
 
 00755.16
 (a) Concrete Mixture - If the results of any test are outside of the specification limits, stop the
 placement of the load. Correct the load or reject it and do not incorporate it into the Work. Test
 subsequent loads before any further concrete placement. Correct the subsequent loads if any of
 the tests are still outside the specification limits. If the load cannot be corrected, reject it and do
 not incorporate it into the Work. Testing of subsequent loads may return to the specified
 frequency when the test results from two consecutive loads are shown to meet the specification
 limits.
 (b) Records - Deliver all batch tickets, water-cement ratio calculations, and all other records
 required to the Engineer upon availability but no later than the morning of the next Day.
 00755.16 Acceptance of Concrete:
 (a) General - Acceptance of concrete will be based on the results of the Contractor's quality
 control testing according to Section 00165.
 (b) Aggregate - Acceptance will be based on the Contractor's quality control testing, if verified
 by the Agency according to Section 00165.
 (1) Aggregate Gradation - A stockpile contains specification Aggregate gradation when the
 quality level for each sieve size calculated according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than
 the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 for a PF of 1.00. Each required sample represents
 a sublot. When the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 yields a PF of less than 1.00 for
 any constituent, the material is non-specification.
 (2) Non-specification Aggregate Gradation - Stockpiled Aggregates that contain
 non-specification Aggregate gradation will be rejected by the Engineer unless non-specification
 material is removed from the stockpile. Do not add additional material to the stockpile until
 enough non-specification material is removed so that the quality level for each constituent is
 equal to or greater than the quality level in Table 00165-2 for a 1.00 PF.
 (c) Plastic Concrete - Acceptance of the plastic concrete will be based on the tests performed
 by the Contractor's QCT, according to the tolerances and limits of Section 02001.
 (d) Hardened Concrete - Acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on statistical analysis,
 according to Section 00165, of the compressive strength tests of the cylinders cast by the QCT.
 Test the cylinders at an ODOT certified laboratory.
 (1) Random Sampling and Testing - Obtain samples from each sublot on a random basis.
 Cast a minimum of 3 cylinders. Cast and cure the test specimens according to AASHTO T 23
 in 6 inch x 12 inch single-use plastic molds and test at 28 days according to AASHTO T 22.
 (2) Lots - A lot is the total quantity of concrete produced for each mix design with the same
 specification limits of all constituents in each stage. Slipformed and non-slipformed concrete
 will be sampled and evaluated as separate lots.
 
 In lots with less than three sublots, the valid individual cylinders each will be considered a
 sublot and statistically evaluated. Obtain at least one set of cylinders for each lot.
 (3) Sublot Strength Test Value - The average of the 28-Day compressive strength tests of
 the three cylinders will constitute the SSTV.
 
 Any cylinders in a sublot showing definite evidence (other than low strength) of improper
 sampling, molding, curing or testing will be discarded, and the average of the strengths of the
 
 752
 
 00755.23
 remaining cylinders will constitute the SSTV. If all three cylinders comprising a sublot are
 discarded, the lot will be evaluated on the basis of the reduced number of sublots.
 If the compressive strength of the lowest strength cylinder in a sublot is lower than the average
 strength of the remaining cylinders in that sublot by more than 10 percent, that cylinder
 strength will be discarded and the average of the remaining cylinders will comprise the SSTV.
 (4) Quality Level Analysis - Statistically analyze the SSTV's and determine the PF for each
 lot of concrete, except that there will be no USL, and the LSL will equal the specified design
 strength.

 00755.43
 Construction
 00755.40 Weather Limitations - Coordinate all operations involved in constructing the Pavement
 so the Work will result in a finished Pavement conforming to the Specifications regardless of the
 daily or seasonal variations in weather, temperature and humidity under which the Work is allowed
 to proceed.
 
 Do not place PCC during periods of rain. Do not place PCC on frozen bases. Stop placement when
 descending air temperature falls below 35 F. Do not begin placement until the air temperature
 is 35 F in the shade and rising and is forecast to remain above 35 F.
 Protect the Pavement from weather damage. Protect unhardened PCC from precipitation with
 protective material. When PCC is placed during cold weather and the air temperature is forecast to
 drop below 33 F, prevent the concrete from freezing for a minimum of 7 days after placement.
 Remove and replace weather damaged Pavement at no additional cost to the Agency.
 00755.41 Preparation of Base:
 (a) Condition - Before paving operations begin, bring the Base on which the Pavement is to be
 constructed to a finished condition required by the Specifications.
 
 Clean the surface of all loose material. Remove all pooling and flowing water. Place concrete on
 existing and new asphalt only when the asphalt surface is less than 90 °F.
 (b) Area - Bring the full width and length of the area on which the tracks of the paving Equipment
 are to operate to the density and surface tolerance required of the base material.
 00755.42 Construction Widths - When the Pavement consists of two or more Traffic Lanes,
 construct at least two Traffic Lanes in one strip Panel unless shown otherwise.
 
 If the Contractor proposes a method of placement other than that shown or specified, the Contractor
 shall pay all costs to implement the change. Any changes require Engineer's approval.
 00755.43 Placing Reinforcement:
 (a) General - Place reinforcement as shown and specified. The Contractor's Equipment hauling
 reinforcement to the site will not be allowed on the concrete Subgrade or Base.
 
 The reinforcement shall be straight, clean, and free of scale or other matter which would interfere
 with its bonding to the concrete.
 Place the reinforcement on support devices that maintain it in specified position during concrete
 placement. The use of tube feeding to place rebar in plastic concrete mix will not be allowed.
 On areas where traffic is operating adjacent to concrete paving operations, do not lift
 reinforcement from the surface or place on supporting devices more than 2 hours before placing
 the concrete, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 (b) Deformed Bar Reinforcement - Tie or clip at every other transverse bar intersection, as a
 minimum, in a manner that does not allow for displacement. Tie or clip every lap splice as
 shown.
 (c) Welded Wire Fabric - Store, handle and place with care to prevent distortion.
 
 755
 
 00755.44
 (d) Support Devices - Support devices used to hold reinforcement in proper position in the
 concrete shall:
 
 • Hold the reinforcement within 1/2 inch of the vertical position shown.
 • Not displace more than 3 cubic inches of concrete when embedded in the slab.
 Obtain approval of the proposed support devices before use.
 If concrete placement operations displace the reinforcement, stop production and place additional
 support devices.
 (e) Tie Bars - Place tie bars required for contact-type longitudinal joints by one of the following
 methods:
 (1) By drilling the hardened concrete section and then inserting and grouting the tie bars into
 place. Drill the holes large and deep enough to insert the tie bars with adequate epoxy or
 non-epoxy grout. Take care not to damage the reinforcement when drilling the holes. Drill
 after the concrete attains enough strength so no damage to the concrete is caused by the
 drilling. Replace loose tie bars at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (2) By inserting the tie bars into the plastic slipformed concrete before vibrating and finishing
 the concrete. The tie bars may be bent before insertion. Replace any loose tie bars by drilling
 and grouting, as described in 00755.43(e)(1), at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (3) By using threaded mechanical splice couplers from the QPL. Submit splices for approval
 before using. Rebar splices shall be:
 
 • Accompanied by manufacturer's quality compliance certificate according to 00165.35.
 • Installed according to manufacturer's recommendations.
 (f) Dowel Bars - Place dowel bars for joint contact at existing concrete Pavement surfaces by
 drilling the existing concrete section and then inserting the dowel bars and grouting them in place.
 Drill the holes large and deep enough to insert the dowel bars with adequate epoxy or non-epoxy
 grout. Adjust hole locations to avoid damaging any existing reinforcement when drilling the holes.
 Blow the dowel bar holes clean with compressed air before grouting. Center the bar in the hole
 for the full length of embedment before grouting. Pump the grout into the hole around the bar so
 the back of the hole will be filled first. Do not allow blocking or shimming to impede the flow of the
 grout into the hole. If dams are needed, place them at the front of the holes to confine the grout.
 Place the dams to permit the escape of air without leaking grout. Do not remove dams until grout
 has cured in the hole.
 00755.44 Handling, Measuring, and Batching Materials - The plant site, layout, Equipment and
 provisions for transporting material shall be adequate to assure a continuous supply of material to
 the worksite.
 (a) Aggregates - Stockpile and remove the Aggregate from stockpiles in a manner that holds
 segregation to a minimum.
 
 Do not use Aggregates that become segregated, mixed with earth or foreign material, or contain
 lumps of hardened material. Thaw frozen Aggregates or Aggregates containing frozen lumps
 before use.
 (b) Batching - Batch materials according to 02001.40.
 
 756
 
 00755.46
 00755.45 Mixing Concrete - Mix the concrete according to 02001.40. Mix the concrete in a batch
 plant mixer, except truck mixers may mix and deliver concrete only to areas inaccessible to paving
 Equipment.
 00755.46 Placing Concrete:
 (a) Delivery To Spreader - Deliver the concrete from the hauling vehicles to the placer/spreader
 hopper on the Shoulder area. Do not permit Equipment hauling concrete on the Subgrade or on
 the Base, except for a minimum number of approved right angle or near right angle crossings.
 Correct damage to the Subgrade or Base due to the Contractor's operations to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer at no additional cost to the Agency. Keep the surface of the Subgrade or Base
 moist in front of the paving operation.
 (b) One Lift - Place the concrete in final position by the slipform method in one Lift, so a
 minimum of finishing will be necessary to provide a dense, homogenous Pavement conforming to
 true grade and Cross Section, except when 00755.50 applies.
 (c) Spreading and Finishing Construction - Except for concrete Pavement to be placed and
 finished at locations inaccessible to slipform paving Equipment, place the concrete with slipform
 paving Equipment designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float-finish the plastic concrete in
 one complete Pass of the machine to provide a dense and homogeneous Pavement surface with
 a minimum of hand finishing. Use hand screeding and float finishing only on small irregular
 areas.
 Consolidate the plastic concrete by internal vibration with transverse vibrating units located within
 the specified thickness of Pavement sections for the full width of Pavement. A series of equally
 spaced longitudinal vibrating units may be used to supplement or replace the transverse vibrating
 units.
 Maintain the frequency of vibration of each vibrating unit above 7,500 cycles per minute.
 Maintain the frequency or amplitude of vibration to consolidate the plastic concrete along the
 entire length of the vibrating unit and for a distance of at least 1 foot. Vary the frequency or
 vibration of amplitude proportionately with the rate of travel to result in a uniform density and air
 content.
 Horizontally space vibrators according to the manufacturer's recommendations or not more
 than 18 inches, center-to-center, whichever is less. Do not exceed a 9 inch space from the outer
 edge of the Pavement to the outside vibrator.
 (d) Continuous Forward Motion - Coordinate all operations of mixing, delivering and spreading
 concrete to provide uniform progress. Operate the slipform paver with as nearly continuous
 forward movement as possible. Hold stopping and starting the paver to an absolute minimum. If,
 for any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward motion of the paver, the vibratory and tamping
 elements shall also be stopped immediately. Apply no external force to the paver.
 (e) Provision for Joints and Other Devices - While placing concrete, make provision for
 constructing joints, placing dowels, tie bars, and other devices, as shown and directed, and as
 provided in 00755.43 and 00755.48.
 (f) Reject Concrete Material - Reject concrete if it:
 
 • Is not in place within 1 hour after being mixed.
 • Has begun to take an initial set before placement.
 • Has been retempered with water.
 757
 
 00755.47
 (g) Protect Surface - Equip supports of the slipform paver, and other Equipment which ride on
 previously placed Pavement to meet the requirements of 00755.60, to prevent marring, edge
 breaking or chipping of the previously placed Pavement.
 When concrete is placed adjacent to an existing Pavement, equip that part of the Equipment
 which is supported on the existing Pavement with protective pads on crawler tracks or use
 rubber-tired wheels. Offset the track or wheels to run a sufficient distance from the edge of the
 Pavement to avoid breaking the Pavement edge.
 (h) Hand Operated Equipment - Use shovels, not rakes, to hand spread and distribute the
 concrete. Do not foul the concrete with foreign matter, or disturb joint devices during such
 operations. Furnish hand operated mechanical vibrators satisfactory to the Engineer. Use these
 vibrators to consolidate the concrete Pavement at least 6 feet each side of construction and
 expansion joints and any other areas as directed.
 (i) Illumination - During hours of darkness, adequately illuminate Work areas at no additional
 cost to the Agency.
 00755.47 Test Strip - At the beginning of paving operations, construct one initial test strip of
 concrete Pavement at least 0.1 mile, but not more than 0.2 mile in length at the specified paving
 width. Use the same Equipment for the remainder of the paving. Do not perform further paving until
 the test strip is evaluated according to 00755.55. An additional test strip will be required when:
 • The Contractor proposes using different paving equipment.
 
 • Any portion of a test strip fails to meet the smoothness requirements of 00755.55.
 Change methods and/or Equipment and construct additional test strips until a test strip meets
 smoothness requirements without grinding or other corrective Work. Limit these additional test
 strips to 0.1 mile in length.
 If three test strips fail to meet smoothness requirements before grinding, remove all three strips and
 construct additional test strips at no additional cost to the Agency.
 The Engineer may waive the initial test strip if the Contractor is proposing to use a batch plant mixer
 and paving Equipment that were satisfactorily used on a Department project within the preceding
 12 months and the mixer hasn't been altered or moved.
 00755.48 Joints:
 (a) General - Construct joints of the kinds shown and where shown or directed. Joint types in
 the concrete Pavement will be contraction, construction or expansion. They shall be transverse
 or longitudinal, as shown or directed. Extend all joints and joint filler to Pavement edges or to
 each other.
 Construct all joints at right angles to the surface of the Pavement. Joints shall not vary from
 specified or indicated line by more than 1/4 inch. The tops of joint filler, when required, shall be
 slightly, but not more than 1/8 inch, below and paralleling finished Pavement grade and Cross
 Section. Protect top edges of filler from damage by paving operations.
 All joints which contain preformed filler are to be constructed before the final floating and surface
 finishing of the concrete, unless otherwise directed.
 
 758
 
 00755.49
 (b) Longitudinal Joints - Longitudinal joints shall be the contact type or weakened plane type
 as shown.
 (1) Longitudinal Contact Joints - Construct longitudinal contact joints when concrete is
 placed against hardened concrete, between strips of Pavement or between a strip of
 Pavement and a concrete gutter.
 (2) Longitudinal Weakened Plane Joints - Construct weakened plane joints by sawing to
 the depths and maximum width shown. Saw longitudinal weakened plane joints at the earliest
 possible time following placement of the concrete to prevent uncontrolled cracking without
 damaging the Pavement or joint. Saws may be single or tandem, as the Contractor elects, and
 be controlled by guides to true line. Restore curing agents broken or damaged by the sawing
 operations.
 
 If the top width of sawed joints exceeds 1/4 inch, fill the joint with a poured joint filler.
 (c) Construction Joints - Construct construction joints when there is an interruption
 of 45 minutes in the concrete placing operations.
 
 The new concrete placed against the joint shall conform closely to the proportions and
 consistency of the previously placed concrete except vibrate and consolidate it to a greater
 degree and with more care than normal.
 (1) Continuously Reinforced Pavement - Furnish a self-supported working platform at each
 construction joint. This working platform shall be at least 4 feet wide and long enough to span
 the entire width of the Pavement Panel being constructed. Construct and support the platform
 so it does not rest upon or touch the reinforcing steel. Have the workers use this platform
 when working in the area around construction joints and do not walk on the reinforcing steel.
 Remove any debris or spilled concrete at and beyond the joint, and support the reinforcement
 in proper position.
 
 Form construction joints with a special header board. Take care when forming construction
 joints to assure that the reinforcement and its supports are not displaced, distorted or
 otherwise disturbed. When concrete placement resumes, remove the header board so neither
 the reinforcement nor the bond between the reinforcement and the previously placed concrete
 is disturbed.
 (2) Other Pavements - Unless otherwise shown, do not construct construction joints
 within 10 feet of a transverse expansion or contraction joint. If sufficient concrete has not been
 mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at least 10 feet long, remove the concrete back
 to the last joint and dispose of as directed.
 (d) Terminal Expansion Joints - Locate terminal expansion joints at the ends of runs of
 continuously reinforced concrete Pavement and construct to the dimensions and details shown.
 
 The concrete in sleeper slabs shall conform to 00755.11. The steel reinforcement shall conform
 to Section 02510.
 Vibrate concrete in sleeper slabs until it is completely consolidated and the excavations are
 completely filled. Construct sleeper slabs at least 24 hours before paving operations, unless
 otherwise allowed. Cure the surfaces of sleeper slab concrete according to 00755.53 until
 covered with concrete Pavement.
 00755.49 Surface Finishing - After the concrete has been given a preliminary finish by the
 finishing devices in the slipform paving Equipment, check the surface of the fresh concrete in the
 
 759
 
 00755.50
 longitudinal and transverse direction with a 12-foot straightedge. Correct surface deviations more
 than allowed by 00755.55(a). Lap each successive check with the previous check path by at least
 half the length of the straightedge. This longitudinal checking and correction on areas to be
 graphically profiled will be waived if it is successfully demonstrated that a Pavement surface is
 otherwise produced which conforms to 00755.55(b)(1)(a).
 (a) Edge Slump - Correct any edge slump of the concrete in excess of 1/4 inch before the
 concrete hardens.
 (b) Textured Finish - Upon completion of the machine floating, straightedge testing, edge
 tooling and, if necessary, hand floating, and before initial set of the surface concrete, give the
 surface of the concrete a textured finish.
 Accomplish the textured finish with a steel-tine tool with 1/8 inch wide tines spaced 3/4 inches
 apart that will mark the finished surface to a depth of 1/8 to 3/16 inch without tearing the surface.
 Avoid overlaps of the texturing. Texture the surface parallel to the roadway centerline and full
 roadway width.
 00755.50 Stationary Side Form Construction - Consolidate and finish according to 00755.51.
 (a) Mandatory SSFC - Use stationary side form construction on the standard reinforced concrete
 Pavement at the ends of Structures.
 (b) Optional SSFC - With the approval of the Engineer, Pavement may be constructed between
 stationary side forms in:
 • Areas inaccessible to slipform paving Equipment.
 • Irregular areas.
 • Short sections of Pavement which are necessary to facilitate traffic movement.
 00755.51 Modification of Strike-off, Consolidation, Final Floating, and Surface Finishing Where the width of Pavement is narrow, tapering, or of irregular pattern not lending itself to being
 constructed by prescribed machine methods, the Contractor will be allowed to perform the strike-off,
 consolidation, final floating and surface finishing with Equipment, tools, means, labor and methods
 other than those specified, provided the Work meets with the approval of the Engineer and the
 following requirements:
 • Without causing segregation, vibrate throughout the concrete being placed until it is uniformly
 consolidated.
 
 • Strike off the concrete with templates or screeds designed and manipulated to shape the
 concrete to specified Cross Section between the forms, carrying a slight excess of concrete in
 front of the leading edge of templates or screeds at all times.
 • Following the vibrating and strike-off operations, float the concrete. Include transverse floating
 or other smoothing and finishing actions as necessary. Check and correct the surface
 according to 00755.49. Keep the surface free from laitance, soupy mortar, marks or
 irregularities.
 • Finish the surface according to 00755.49.
 00755.52 Edge Tooling and Filling - Tool edges at transverse joints and longitudinal joints of new
 Pavement and clean joints of previously placed concrete to remove laitance and mortar resulting
 from finishing operations, and to provide clean rounded edges without ridges on the surface.
 
 760
 
 00755.55
 Fill any areas of minor honeycomb or other minor defect in composition of the concrete along the
 exposed sides of concrete with a stiff mortar of cement and fine Aggregate, and apply to the
 moistened concrete to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Remove and replace areas showing serious
 defects in composition of the concrete with specified quality concrete for full Panel width between
 longitudinal joints or edges, and for a length not less than 10 feet. Low spots exceeding 1/4 inch in
 depth, if in hardened concrete, may be filled with an epoxy grout, provided the filling is neat and
 blends inconspicuously with adjoining concrete. Prepare the area according to the grout
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 00755.53 Curing Concrete - Immediately after the final floating, surface finishing and edging have
 been completed, and while the concrete surface is still moist, cover and cure the entire exposed
 surface of the newly placed concrete for at least 72 hours according to one of the following
 provisions:
 (a) Liquid Membrane-Forming Compounds - Apply liquid membrane-forming compound
 uniformly to the concrete by pressure-spray methods at a rate of at least 1 gallon per 150 square
 feet. Mix the liquid membrane-forming compound thoroughly before and during use.
 (b) Other Coverings - Apply the covering to damp concrete as soon as it can be placed without
 marring the surface. Place the membrane in contact with the surface, extend beyond the sides or
 edges of the slabs or forms, and weight down as required to hold it in position as a waterproof
 and moisture-proof covering. Laps shall be sufficient to maintain tightness equivalent to the
 sheeting and use:
 (1) Polyethylene Film - Sheeting shall be clear or white.
 (2) Waterproof Paper - Transverse laps shall be at least 18 inches, and cement longitudinal
 seams.
 (3) Cotton or Jute Mats - Before placing, saturate the mats with water and keep fully wetted
 during the curing period.
 00755.54 Longitudinal Pavement Cracks - Within 28 days after concrete placement and before
 opening the Pavement to Public Traffic, the Engineer will perform a Pavement crack survey. Clean
 the Pavement before the crack survey. Pavement with uncontrolled longitudinal cracks which are
 visible without magnification will be considered unacceptable and be repaired or removed as
 determined by the Engineer. Perform all remedial Work at the no additional cost to the Agency.
 00755.55 Surface Tolerance, Testing, and Correction - The surface of finished Pavement shall
 not deviate from longitudinal and transverse smoothness more than the prescribed limits. Perform
 straightedge testing and graphic profile testing under the supervision of the Engineer with
 Equipment furnished and operated by the Contractor as soon as the hardness of the concrete
 permits.
 (a) Straightedge Testing and Tolerance - Longitudinal and transverse smoothness testing of
 the Pavement surface shall be done with a 12-foot straightedge. The extent of the testing will be
 as the Engineer determines necessary or expedient. The Pavement surface shall not deviate
 from the straightedge at any point by more than 1/8 inch for all areas that are constructed by the
 prescribed machine methods and for all Traffic Lanes and ramps. Other areas shall not deviate
 by more than 1/4 inch. Longitudinal 12-foot straightedge testing will not be required for Pavement
 accepted under 00755.55(b).
 
 761
 
 00755.55
 (b) Graphic Profile Testing (GPT) and Tolerance:
 (1) General - Test the longitudinal surface of all Traffic Lanes, ramps, Shoulders and Bridges
 for smoothness by the graphic profile method according to ODOT TM 770. Before paving
 commences on the Project, demonstrate the profilograph or profilometer operation by
 conducting a calibration test according to ODOT TM 770, and running the machine twice over
 a 0.1 mile section of Pavement with repeating results.
 a. Graphic Profile Tolerance - The Pavement shall have a profile index of 7.0 inches per
 mile or less for each wheel path in each 0.1 mile segment or partial segment, and shall have
 no individual deviation of 0.3 inch or more. On ramps, Shoulders and auxiliary lanes the
 profile index shall be 12.0 inches per mile subject to the above criteria. Bonus payment for
 smoothness will be made according to 00755.95.
 b. Daily GPT - If the average profile index exceeds 7.0 inches per mile for all segments and
 partial segments of Pavement constructed in any Day's production, discontinue paving
 operations and construct one or more test strips as described in 00755.47. The test strip
 may be comprised of Pavement placed during the shift that the shutdown is ordered, but in
 no case shall it be less than 0.1 mile in length.
 (2) Surface Test - Run the profilograph or profilometer over the full length of the Project
 and 50 feet beyond the Project ends to provide a complete graphic profile. This includes all
 concrete Traffic Lanes and auxiliary lanes.
 
 Obtain profiles on the Pavement surface along lines parallel to and approximately 3 feet from
 each edge and longitudinal joints for 12 foot wide lanes and 4 feet from each edge and
 longitudinal joints for 14 foot wide lanes. The intent is to provide a profile in each vehicle
 wheel path. Take profiles on transition areas of entrance and exit ramps as close to the wheel
 path as practicable.
 Start the profiles that represent a Day's production 50 feet before the beginning of that Day's
 production and stop 50 feet before the end of that Day's production.
 Run the profiles for each Day's production as soon as possible without damaging the surface.
 Analyze the daily GPT profiles according to 00755.55(b)(3), and give the profiles and results to
 the Engineer within 24 hours of the conclusion of the Day's production.
 (3) Determining Profile Index:
 a. General - Determine the profile index of Pavement in 0.1 mile segments and partial
 segments. Segments shall begin 13 feet into the Project and run consecutively in either the
 direction of travel or the concrete placement, as determined by the Engineer. A segment
 will end as a partial segment and a new segment will begin when the segment sequence is
 interrupted by stage construction or by profiled areas excluded from the GPT smoothness
 requirements.
 
 The following profiled areas of Pavement are excluded from the GPT smoothness
 requirements:
 • Profiles extending beyond the Project ends.
 • Bridge decks and bridge panels.
 • First and last 13 feet at the Project ends and bridge end panels.
 • Pavement on horizontal curves with radii less than 1,000 feet.
 
 762
 
 00755.56
 Include and analyze separately those areas in the profile charts that are not subject to the
 GPT smoothness profile index requirements.
 b. Method of Analysis - Determine the profile index and individual deviations of 0.3 inch or
 more by analyzing the profile charts according to ODOT TM 770 and provide the profile
 charts and results to the Engineer for review.
 c. Profile Index - The profile index is the inches per mile in excess of the 0.2 inch blanking
 band. The formula for converting counts to profile index is:
 
 Profile Index =
 
 Total Count x 0.10
 Length of Full 0.10 Mile Segment or of Partial
 
 *
 
 Mile Segment
 
 * Report to the nearest 0.01 mile
 (c) Correcting Deficiencies - Should testing described in 00755.49, 00755.51, and 00755.55
 show the Pavement does not conform to the prescribed limits of deviation, the following shall
 apply:
 (1) Failure To Meet Straightedge Requirements:
 a. Plastic Concrete - If the requirements of 00755.49 or 00755.51 are not met, stop the
 paving operations until revised methods, changes in Equipment, or correction of procedures
 are made or proposed for trial, and are approved by the Engineer for trial. Also stop those
 revisions, changes and corrections if they do not produce a specified surface.
 b. Hardened Concrete - If the requirements of 00755.51 or 00755.55(a) are not met,
 correct according to 00755.55(c)(2)(a) or 00755.55(c)(2)(b) and retest.
 (2) Failure To Meet Graphic Profile Requirements - Correct any segment or partial segment
 that exceeds the requirements of 00755.55(b) in either wheel path by one of the methods listed
 below to the specified limits except correct deviations of 0.3 inch or more at least to the edge
 of the blanking band:
 a. Remove - Remove the non-specification concrete Pavement as determined by the
 Engineer and replace with specification concrete Pavement.
 b. Grind - Profile with abrasive grinders, equipped with a cutting head comprised of
 multiple diamond blades. The Engineer will determine and mark the areas to be profiled.
 For all areas corrected by grinding, restore the required surface texture, as specified in
 00755.49(b), by transverse sawing with diamond blade saws.
 
 Retest their entire length, according to 00755.55(b), all segments requiring corrective Work
 with the profilograph or profilometer under the supervision of the Engineer. Perform all
 corrective Work and graphic profiling, including traffic control, at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 00755.56 Pavement Thickness - Construct the Pavement to the thickness shown. Pavement not
 so constructed will be subject to replacement according to 00755.57, or to payment at adjusted
 prices according to 00755.93.
 (a) Sticking Measurements - Determine conformance with minimum thickness requirements by
 random sticking measurements of the plastic concrete according to ODOT TM 775 under the
 Engineer's observation. Report thickness to the nearest 0.1 inch.
 
 763
 
 00755.56
 Divide the Panel into units and partial units equivalent to a maximum of 200 lane feet. Normally,
 unit lengths will be 200 feet for one lane, 100 feet for two lanes, 70 feet for three lanes and as
 appropriate for transition areas. When directed, take one sticking measurement at a randomly
 selected location in each unit and partial unit. Record measurements to the nearest 0.1 inch.
 Take the measurements:
 • After consolidation and screeding and before the float finish.
 
 • No closer than 2 feet from the Panel edges.
 • Within 10 feet longitudinally and 1 foot transversely from the calculated random location
 determined by the Engineer.
 If a sticking is not obtained for a unit or a partial unit, or is not available to represent the area of
 Pavement remaining after the limits of Pavement over 1.0 inch deficient is determined, the
 measurement will be assumed to be the same as the preceding or following sticking
 measurement, that is nearest in distance.
 (b) Thickness 0.5 Inch Deficient - If a sticking measurement indicates the Pavement is 0.5 inch
 or more deficient in thickness, stop forward paving progress until appropriate adjustments are
 made or corrective action is taken.
 (c) Coring Requirements - Perform required coring, or coring requested by the Engineer
 according to AASHTO T 24 and repair core holes as directed, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Cores will be measured by the Engineer according to AASHTO T 148 and the measurements
 reported to the nearest 0.1 inch. Core measurements will replace sticking measurements.
 (1) Corrective Grinding Areas - If corrective grinding required by 00755.55(c) is performed at
 a sticking measurement site, obtain a core at the sticking measurement site according to the
 following:
 a. Profile Indexes 7.0 Inches Per Mile or Less - If the original profile indexes for a
 segment or partial segment determined by 00755.55 is 7.0 inches per mile or less in each
 wheel path, a core is not required after corrective grinding is performed at a sticking
 measurement site within the segment or partial segment represented by the profile indexes.
 b. Profile Index Greater 7.0 Inches Per Mile - If an original graphic profile index for a
 segment or partial segment determined by 00755.55 is more than 7.0 inches per mile for a
 wheel path, obtain a core, after corrective grinding has been performed, at a sticking
 measurement site within the segment or partial segment represented by the profile indexes
 if the sticking measurement is the specified depth or less.
 (2) Cores Requested By Contractor - If the Contractor believes that a sticking measurement
 or a core is not representative of the actual Pavement thickness, the Contractor may take a
 replacement core. Take replacement cores at a location as directed, 10 feet from the sticking
 measurement or core site in question and the same distance from centerline. The
 replacement core measurement will replace the original sticking or core measurement.
 (d) Thickness Over 1.0 Inch Deficient - If a sticking measurement shows Pavement
 over 1.0 inch deficient, obtain a core at the sticking measurement site. If this core, or a core
 determined by 00755.56(c)(1), shows Pavement over 1.0 inch deficient, obtain additional cores.
 Take these additional cores at the same distance from the centerline and at 25 foot intervals each
 direction from the first core until a core in each direction shows Pavement 1.0 inch deficient or
 less. These two core locations will be considered the limits of the Pavement more than 1.0 inch
 deficient. The Pavement Panel between these two cores will represent the area of Pavement
 subject to removal and replacement under 00755.57 or no payment under 00755.93.
 764
 
 00755.60
 When it is suspected by the Engineer that the Pavement in the adjacent travel lanes in the Panel
 may be more than 1.0 inch deficient for a greater distance than determined by the above
 procedure, core the Pavement in the adjacent travel lanes in the nearest wheel track (3 feet from
 the nearest edge) opposite both limit cores. If these cores are more than 1.0 inch deficient, the
 above procedure shall be followed to determine the limits.
 00755.57 Deficient Pavement - Remove and replace Pavement deficient in thickness by more
 than 1.0 inch, according to 00755.56(d), at no additional cost to the Agency. If allowed by the
 Engineer, the Pavement may be left in place without payment. Replacement Pavement shall be of
 the specified design, quality and thickness as follows:
 
 • Be the full width of the Pavement Panel involved.
 • Extend far enough to replace at least a 20 foot length.
 • Extend to the construction joint if closer than 20 feet to a construction joint.
 00755.58 Terminal Anchors - Furnish concrete for anchors according to 00755.11. Furnish steel
 meeting the requirements for standard Pavement reinforcement as shown.
 
 Vibrate the concrete in anchors until it is consolidated and the excavations are filled. Construct
 anchors at least 24 hours before paving operations. Keep the surfaces of anchor concrete moist
 and clean until covered with Pavement concrete.
 00755.59 Flexible to Rigid Pavement Transition Systems - Furnish the concrete in Pavement
 transition systems according to 00755.11. Furnish steel meeting the requirements for standard
 Pavement reinforcement as shown.
 
 Vibrate the concrete in Pavement transition systems until it is consolidated and the excavations are
 filled. Construct Pavement transition systems at least 24 hours before paving operations.
 Maintenance
 00755.60 Protection of Concrete - Repair or replace any part of the Pavement damaged by traffic
 or damaged from any other cause before its official acceptance, according to 00170.80.
 
 The maturity method, AASHTO T 325, may be used to estimate concrete strength for opening
 Pavement to construction traffic. Install at least two maturity thermocouples for each Day's
 placement in areas where the maturity method will be used for early opening. Install the
 thermocouples near the Day's final placement for areas being evaluated for early opening.
 When the maturity method is used, the Engineer may verify the maturity method with strength
 specimens. Establish a new strength-maturity relationship if strength specimens deviate more than
 10 percent from the maturity-estimated strengths. Suspend use of the maturity method for opening
 Pavements to traffic when the strength-maturity relationship deviates by more than 10 percent until
 a new strength-maturity relationship is established.
 Do not operate construction Equipment on newly placed concrete until the requirements of (a), (b),
 and (c) are met. Do not allow Public Traffic on newly placed concrete until all of the following
 requirements are met:
 (a) The Contractor complies with 00150.60.
 
 765
 
 00755.80
 (b) The concrete attains a compressive strength of at least 70 percent of the specified 28-Day
 strength as determined by testing at least three cylinders cured according to AASHTO T 23 (field
 cure) and tested according to AASHTO T 22.
 (c) The surface of the concrete is protected from scarring or abrasion and kept free of stones,
 loose mortar and other matter apt to be deleterious to the concrete in the paths of Equipment.
 (d) The Pavement meets all of the requirements of 00755.55.
 Measurement
 00755.80 Measurement - The quantities of concrete Pavement will be measured on the area basis.
 The area will be determined by measuring the width and length of each separately constructed
 Panel of Pavement. The width is the design width or measured edge-to-edge width on the surface
 of the Pavement, whichever is less. The length is the horizontal measurement from end to end of
 Pavement along the center line of the strip.
 
 The measurement of extra thickness of Pavement, as shown or as ordered, will be determined by
 conversion on a proportionate volume basis to an equivalent number of square yards of specified
 thickness Pavement.
 The quantities of terminal anchors will be measured on the length basis, along the center line of
 each anchor as constructed.
 The quantities of flexible to rigid Pavement transition systems will be measured on the unit basis
 where each unit is one lane width.
 Payment
 00755.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of Work performed under this Section will be paid for
 at the Contract unit price, per unit of measurement, for the following items:
 Pay Item
 
 (a)
 (b)
 (c)

 In items (b) and (d), the thickness of the Pavement will be inserted in the blank when more than one
 thickness is required under the Contract.
 Payment will be payment in full for furnishing and placing all Materials, and for furnishing all
 Equipment, labor, and Incidentals necessary to complete the Work as specified.
 No separate or additional payment will be made for splices in the terminal anchors required due to
 staged construction.
 00755.92 Price Adjustment for Strength - For each lot of concrete for which a PF is determined,
 the following will apply:
 
 • In no case will the actual payment exceed the Contract Unit Price.
 
 766
 
 00755.95
 • When the PF is less than 1.00, the price adjustment will be determined as follows:
 Price Adjustment = 0.3 x (PF - 1) x Unit Price
 00755.93 Price Adjustment for Variation in Thickness - No additional payment over the Contract
 unit price will be made for Pavement having a thickness greater than shown or ordered by the
 Engineer. When the Pavement is found deficient in thickness by more than 0.2 inch, but not more
 than 1.0 inch, as determined according to 00755.56, payment will be made at an adjusted price
 according to the following table:
 Deficiency in
 Thickness (Inch)
 
 Proportional Part of Contract
 Unit Price Allowed
 
 0.00 to 0.20
 0.21 to 0.30
 0.31 to 0.40
 0.41 to 0.50
 0.51 to 0.75
 0.76 to 1.00
 
 100%
 83%
 76%
 73%
 63%
 59%
 
 No payment will be made for any area of Pavement found deficient in thickness by more
 than 1.0 inch even though such Pavement is allowed by the Engineer to remain in place under the
 provisions of 00755.57.
 00755.95 Bonus Payment for Smoothness - A bonus payment of up to 1.5 percent will be made
 to the Contractor for each 0.1 mile segment or partial segment of Pavement except Shoulders, as
 determined in 00755.55(b) if:
 
 • The profile index for each wheel path is 7.0 inches per mile or less.
 • No individual deviation is 0.3 inch or more.
 • The average of the two profile indexes is less than 5.0 inches per mile.
 • These requirements are met without any corrective action specified in 00755.55(c).
 The bonus payment for each segment and partial segment meeting the above requirements will be
 computed as follows:
 Bonus = 0.006 x (5.0 - PI) x Quantity x Unit Price
 PI = Average of the two profile indexes in the segment or partial segment (inches per mile)
 Quantity = The quantity (square yards) represented by the segment or partial segment
 Unit Price = The unit price for the concrete Pavement as shown in the Contract Schedule of Items

 00756.16 Acceptance of Concrete:
 (a) General - Acceptance of concrete will be based on the results of the Contractor's quality
 control testing according to Section 00165.
 (b) Aggregate - Acceptance will be based on the Contractor's quality control testing, if verified
 by the Agency according to Section 00165.
 (1) Aggregate Gradation - A stockpile contains specification Aggregate gradation when the
 quality level for each sieve size calculated according to 00165.40 is equal to or greater than
 the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 for a PF of 1.00. Each required sample represents
 a sublot. When the quality level indicated in Table 00165-2 yields a PF of less than 1.00 for
 any constituent, the material is non-specification.
 (2) Non-specification Aggregate Gradation - Stockpiled Aggregates that contain
 non-specification Aggregate gradation will be rejected by the Engineer unless non-specification
 material is removed from the stockpile. Do not add additional material to the stockpile until
 enough non-specification material is removed so that the quality level for each constituent is
 equal to or greater than the quality level in Table 00165-2 for a 1.00 PF.
 (c) Plastic Concrete - Acceptance of the plastic concrete will be based on the tests performed
 by the Contractor's QCT, according to the tolerances and limits of Section 02001.
 (d) Hardened Concrete - Cast and cure the test specimens according to AASHTO T 23
 in 6 inch x 12 inch single-use plastic molds and test at 28 days according to AASHTO T 22.
 (1) General - For all classes of concrete, acceptance of hardened concrete will be based on
 an analysis of compressive strength tests of cylinders cast by the QCT. Test the cylinders at
 an ODOT certified laboratory.
 (2) Actual Strength Test Value - The ASTV at 28 days is the average compressive strength
 of the three cylinders tested. If the compressive strength of a single test specimen varies by
 more than 10 percent from the average of the other two specimens, that compressive strength
 value will be discarded. The average compressive strength test of the two remaining
 specimens will be the ASTV.
 (3) Sampling and Testing - Sampling and testing shall be according to the MFTP.
 (4) Acceptance - The ASTV shall exceed the 'c (specified strength) for the mix design. If a
 set of cylinders has an ASTV less than 'c, the Engineer will review the results to determine if
 the concrete represented by the cylinders shall be removed. In any case, concrete that has an
 ASTV of less than 85 percent of the specified strength shall be removed unless otherwise
 authorized, in writing, by the Engineer. The cost of removal, replacement and all related Work
 
 769
 
 00756.20
 shall be the Contractor's responsibility, subject, if the concrete is allowed to remain in place, to
 a price adjustment according to 00150.25.
 If an ASTV falls below the ƒ'c, the Contractor may submit a written plan within 3 days of the
 test for review by the Engineer. The plan shall outline a proposed alternate method of
 evaluating compressive strength. The plan shall provide evidence that a reasonable 'cr
 (over-design) was maintained and that there is credible evidence (besides low strength) which
 warrants consideration of this option. If the Engineer determines that the compressive strength
 test results are suspect from definable external factors, the Engineer may allow an alternate
 method of acceptance.

 Construction
 00756.40 Weather Limitations - Coordinate all operations involved in constructing the Pavement
 so the Work will result in a finished Pavement conforming to the Specifications regardless of the
 daily or seasonal variations in weather, temperature and humidity under which the Work is allowed
 to proceed.
 
 Do not place PCC during periods of rain. Do not place PCC on frozen bases, or when descending
 air temperature falls below 35 F. Placement shall not resume until ascending air temperature
 reaches 35 F. Measure air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat.
 Protect the Pavement from weather damage. Protect unhardened PCC from precipitation with
 protective material. When PCC is being placed during cold weather, and the air temperature is
 forecast to drop below 33 F, prevent the PCC from freezing for a minimum of 7 days after placing.
 Remove and replace weather damaged Pavement at no additional cost to the Agency.
 00756.41 Preparation of Base - Before paving operations begin, bring the Base to the finished
 condition required by the Specifications. If the Equipment used by the Contractor requires additional
 width for support, provide the support necessary to assure the Equipment maintains proper grade
 and Cross Section.
 
 The Base shall be moist before the concrete is placed. When the Base is a treated Base the
 surface shall be clean and free of all loose material. Place concrete on existing and new treated
 Base only when the surface temperature is less than 90 °F. If water is used for cooling, remove all
 excess water standing in pools or flowing on the surface before placing concrete.
 Manholes, inlets and other such Structures shall be completed, adjusted, cured and otherwise
 prepared, as applicable, and ready to have concrete placed in contact with them. Prepare manhole
 frames and other independent metal Structures in the Pavement area with an approved bondpreventing agent.
 00756.42 Construction Widths - When the Pavement consists of two or more Traffic Lanes,
 construct at least two Traffic Lanes in one strip Panel unless shown otherwise.
 
 If the Contractor proposes a method of placement other than that shown or specified, the Contractor
 shall pay all costs to implement the change. Any changes require the Engineer's approval.
 
 772
 
 00756.45
 00756.43 Placing Dowel Bars and Tie Bars:
 (a) Dowel Bars - Provide smooth, round, epoxy coated dowel bars. Coat with plastic, grease,
 heavy oil, or other approved material that will neither bond with nor be harmful to the PCC. Use a
 framework to place dowels that is continuous across the entire lane width, holds the dowels
 parallel with each other, holds the dowels parallel with the surface of the Pavement, and holds the
 dowels parallel to the roadway centerline. For dowels placed across an expansion joint, use a
 dowel bar basket or other system of support that leaves no permanent incompressible members
 in place within the joint. Maximum alignment tolerance shall be 5 degrees or 3/16 inch in the
 length of the dowel. Place dowels within 3/8 inch of the center of the slab vertically.
 
 Place dowel bars for joint contact at existing concrete Pavement surfaces by drilling the existing
 concrete section and then inserting the dowel bars and grouting them in place. Drill the holes
 large and deep enough to insert the dowel bars with adequate epoxy or non-epoxy grout. Adjust
 hole locations to avoid damaging any existing reinforcement when drilling the holes. Blow the
 dowel bar holes clean with compressed air before grouting. Center the bar in the hole for the full
 length of embedment before grouting. Pump the grout into the hole around the bar so the back of
 the hole will be filled first. Do not allow blocking or shimming to impede the flow of the grout into
 the hole. If dams are needed, place them at the front of the holes to confine the grout. Place the
 dams to permit the escape of air without leaking grout. Do not remove dams until grout has cured
 in the hole.
 (b) Tie Bars - Provide epoxy coated tie bars and place them for contact-type longitudinal joints
 by one of the following methods:
 
 • By drilling the hardened concrete section and then inserting and grouting the tie bars into
 place. Drill the holes large and deep enough to insert the tie bars with adequate epoxy or
 non-epoxy grout. Take care not to damage the reinforcement when drilling the holes. Drill
 after the concrete attains enough strength so no damage to the concrete is caused by the
 drilling. Replace loose tie bars at no additional cost to the Agency.
 • By inserting the tie bars into the plastic slipformed concrete before vibrating and finishing
 the concrete. The tie bars may be bent before insertion. Replace any loose tie bars by
 drilling and grouting, as described above, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 • By using threaded mechanical splice couplers from the QPL. Submit splices for approval
 before using. Rebar splices shall be:
 • Accompanied by manufacturer's quality compliance certificate according to 00165.35.
 • Installed according to manufacturer's recommendations.
 00756.44 Handling, Measuring, and Batching Materials - The plant site, layout, Equipment and
 provisions for transporting material shall be adequate to assure a continuous supply of material to
 the worksite.
 (a) Aggregates - Stockpile and remove the Aggregate from stockpiles in a manner that holds
 segregation to a minimum.
 
 Do not use Aggregates that become segregated, mixed with earth or foreign material or contain
 lumps of hardened material. Thaw frozen Aggregates or Aggregates containing frozen lumps
 before use.
 (b) Batching - Batch materials according to 02001.40.
 00756.45 Mixing Concrete - Mix materials according to 02001.40. Mix the concrete in a batch
 plant mixer, except truck mixers may mix and deliver concrete only to areas inaccessible to paving
 Equipment.
 
 773
 
 00756.46
 00756.46 Placing Concrete - Place the concrete Pavement with a slipform paving machine as
 described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) below. Concrete Pavement may be constructed between stationary
 side forms as described in (e) below only when:
 
 • Areas of continuous concrete Pavement are less than 1,000 square yards.
 • Areas are inaccessible to slipform paving Equipment.
 • In areas of irregular geometry.
 • In short sections of Pavement which are necessary to facilitate traffic movement.
 (a) Delivery To Spreader - Deliver the concrete from the hauling vehicles to the placer/spreader
 hopper on the Shoulder area. Do not permit Equipment hauling concrete on the Subgrade or on
 the Base, except for a minimum number of approved right angle or near right angle crossings.
 Correct damage to the Subgrade or Base due to the Contractor's operations, to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer, at no additional cost to the Agency. Keep the surface of the Subgrade or Base
 moist in front of the paving operation.
 (b) One Lift - Place the concrete in final position by the slipform method in one Lift, so a
 minimum of finishing will be necessary to provide a dense, homogenous Pavement conforming to
 true grade and Cross Section.
 (c) Spreading and Finishing Construction - Place the concrete with slipform paving
 Equipment designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float-finish the plastic concrete in one
 complete Pass of the machine to provide a dense and homogeneous Pavement surface with a
 minimum of hand finishing. Use hand screeding and float finishing only on small irregular areas.
 
 Consolidate the plastic concrete by internal vibration with transverse vibrating units located within
 the specified thickness of Pavement sections for the full width of Pavement. A series of equally
 spaced longitudinal vibrating units may be used to supplement or replace the transverse vibrating
 units.
 Maintain the frequency of vibration of each vibrating unit above 7,500 cycles per minute.
 Maintain the frequency or amplitude of vibration to consolidate the plastic concrete along the
 entire length of the vibrating unit and for a distance of at least 1 foot. Vary the frequency or
 vibration of amplitude proportionately with the rate of travel to result in a uniform density and air
 content.
 Horizontally space vibrators according to the manufacturer's recommendations or not more
 than 18 inches, center-to-center, whichever is less. Do not exceed a 9 inch space from the outer
 edge of the Pavement to the outside vibrator.
 (d) Continuous Forward Motion - Coordinate all operations of mixing, delivering and spreading
 concrete to provide uniform progress. Operate the slipform paver with as nearly continuous
 forward movement as possible. Hold stopping and starting the paver to an absolute minimum. If,
 for any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward motion of the paver, immediately stop the
 vibratory and tamping elements. Apply no external force to the paver.
 (e) Stationary Side Form Method - Place the PCC between stationary side forms by means
 that will prevent segregation of constituents of the PCC, displacement or deformation of the forms
 or Base, forming of piles, and unequal consolidation.
 
 Spread and distribute the PCC with a mechanical concrete spreader which will fill all corners and
 spaces with PCC and leave it at such height that after consolidation and finishing it will be at
 specified grade and Cross Section. Spread and vibrate the PCC against and along the forms,
 774
 
 00756.47
 and in the vicinity of joints comprising load transfer devices, with care to avoid displacement of
 the forms or devices.
 Use shovels or muckrakes, not rakes, for hand spreading and distributing. Do not foul the PCC
 with foreign matter.
 After being placed, strike-off, vibrate and consolidate the PCC with Equipment conforming to the
 requirements of 00756.23. If more than one machine is required to properly handle production,
 the vibrating of PCC shall normally precede or accompany the first or leading machine only.
 Perform the operations above within 15 minutes after the PCC is placed. The operations shall be
 continuous until the surface has been worked the equivalent of not less than two Passes of a
 single screed machine. In each Pass of the machine, maintain a roll of PCC ahead of the screed
 for the entire width of Pavement being placed. The strike-off, vibrating and consolidating shall
 leave a surface of uniform texture, true to grade and Cross Section.
 Equipment shall be in good mechanical condition at all times and be adjusted for wear at the
 direction of the Engineer. Keep forms and other controls of line and grade clean and true to line
 and grade.
 (f) Provision for Joints and Other Devices - While placing concrete, make provision for
 constructing joints, placing dowels, tie bars, and other devices as shown and directed, and as
 provided in 00756.43 and 00756.48.
 (g) Reject Concrete Material - Reject concrete if it:
 
 • Is not in place within 1 hour after being mixed (90 minutes when delivered in ready mix
 truck).
 • Has begun to take an initial set before placement.
 • Has been retempered with water.
 (h) Protect Surface - Equip supports of the slipform paver, and other Equipment which ride on
 previously placed Pavement to meet the requirements of 00756.60, to prevent marring, edge
 breaking, or chipping of the previously placed Pavement.
 
 When concrete is placed adjacent to an existing Pavement, equip that part of the Equipment
 which is supported on the existing Pavement with protective pads on crawler tracks or use
 rubber-tired wheels. Offset the track or wheels to run a sufficient distance from the edge of the
 Pavement to avoid breaking the Pavement edge
 (i) Hand Operated Equipment - Use shovels and muckrakes, not rakes, for hand spreading and
 distributing. Do not foul the concrete with foreign matter, or disturb joint devices during such
 operations. Furnish hand operated mechanical vibrators satisfactory to the Engineer. Use these
 vibrators to consolidate the concrete Pavement at least 6 feet on each side of construction and
 expansion joints and any other areas as directed.
 (j) Illumination - During hours of darkness, adequately illuminate work areas at no additional
 cost to the Agency.
 00756.47 Test Strip - At the beginning of paving operations, construct one initial test strip of
 concrete Pavement at least 0.1 mile long at the specified paving width. Do not perform further
 paving until the test strip is evaluated according to 00756.55. An additional test strip will be required
 when:
 
 775
 
 00756.48
 • The Contractor proposes using different paving equipment.
 • Any portion of a test strip fails to meet the smoothness requirements of 00756.55.
 Change methods and/or Equipment and construct additional test strips until a test strip meets
 smoothness requirements without grinding or other corrective Work. Limit these additional test
 strips to 0.1 mile in length.
 If three test strips fail to meet smoothness requirements before grinding, remove all three strips and
 construct additional test strips at no additional cost to the Agency.
 00756.48 Joints:
 (a) General - Construct joints of the kinds shown and where shown or directed. Joint types in
 the concrete Pavement will be contraction, construction or expansion. They shall be transverse
 or longitudinal, as shown or directed. Extend all joints and joint filler to Pavement edges or to
 each other.
 
 Joints shall not vary from specified or indicated line by more than 1/4 inch. The tops of joint filler,
 when required, shall be slightly, but not more than 1/8 inch, below and paralleling finished
 Pavement grade and Cross Section. Protect top edges of filler from damage by paving
 operations.
 All joints which contain preformed filler are to be constructed before the final floating and surface
 finishing of the concrete, unless otherwise directed.
 (b) Longitudinal Joints - If the Contractor elects to pour the entire width of Pavement at one
 time, construct the longitudinal joint as shown. Longitudinal joints shall be the contact type or
 weakened plane type as shown:
 (1) Longitudinal Contact Joints - Construct longitudinal contact joints when concrete is
 placed against hardened concrete regardless of age, between strips of Pavement or between
 a strip of Pavement and a concrete gutter.
 (2) Longitudinal Weakened Plane Joints - Construct weakened plane joints by sawing to
 the depths and maximum width shown. Saw longitudinal weakened plane joints at the earliest
 possible time following placement of the concrete to prevent uncontrolled cracking without
 damaging the Pavement or joint. Saws may be single or tandem, as the Contractor elects, and
 be controlled by guides to true line. Restore curing agents broken or damaged by the sawing
 operations.
 (c) Construction Joints - Construct construction joints when there is an interruption of
 45 minutes in the concrete placing operations.
 
 The new concrete placed against the joint shall conform closely to the proportions and
 consistency of the previously placed concrete except vibrate and consolidate it to a greater
 degree and with more care than normal. Unless otherwise shown, do not construct construction
 joints within 10 feet of a transverse expansion or contraction joint. If sufficient concrete has not
 been mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at least 10 feet long, remove the concrete
 back to the last joint and dispose of as directed.
 (d) Transverse Contraction Joints - Form transverse contraction joints by sawing to the
 required dimensions shown on the Plans. Saw transverse contraction joints at the earliest
 possible time following placement of the concrete to prevent uncontrolled cracking without
 damaging the Pavement or joint. Repair any damage to the curing material during the sawing
 operations immediately after the sawing is completed.
 
 776
 
 00756.52
 (e) Sealing Sawed Joints - Fill sawed longitudinal weakened plane joints and transverse
 contraction joints with poured joint filler. Thoroughly clean joints at the time of sealing. Ensure
 the curing period for joints is complete before allowing construction Equipment and vehicles on
 the Pavement.
 00756.49 Surface Finishing - After the concrete has been given a preliminary finish, check the
 surface of the fresh concrete in the longitudinal and transverse direction with a 12-foot straightedge.
 Correct surface deviations more than allowed by 00756.55(a). Check at interval as required. This
 longitudinal checking and correction on areas to be graphically profiled will be waived if it is
 successfully demonstrated that required Pavement profile surface is otherwise produced which
 conforms to 00756.55(b)(1)(a).
 
 Following hand floating, use a 12 foot proof (grout) rod. Each Pass of the proof rod in the
 longitudinal direction, over the entire surface of the Pavement placement, shall overlap the previous
 Pass by half of its width. Check the transverse direction as required. Use of a proof rod on areas to
 be graphically profiled will be waived if it is successfully demonstrated that required Pavement
 profile surface is otherwise produced which conforms to 00756.55(b)(1)(a).
 (a) Edge Slump - Correct any edge slump of the concrete in excess of 1/4 inch before the
 concrete hardens.
 (b) Textured Finish - Upon completion of the machine floating, straightedge testing, edge
 tooling and, if necessary, hand floating, and before initial set of the surface concrete, give the
 surface of the concrete a textured finish.
 
 Accomplish the textured finish with a steel-tine tool with 1/8 inch wide tines spaced 3/4 inches
 apart that will mark the finished surface to a depth of 1/8 to 3/16 inch without tearing the surface.
 Avoid overlaps of the texturing. Texture the surface parallel to the roadway centerline and full
 roadway width.
 00756.51 Modification of Strike-off, Consolidation, Final Floating, and Surface Finishing Where the width of Pavement is narrow, tapering or of irregular pattern, not lending itself to being
 constructed by prescribed machine methods, the Contractor will be allowed to perform the strike off,
 consolidation, final floating, and surface finishing with Equipment, tools, means, labor and methods
 other than those specified, provided the Work meets with the approval of the Engineer and the
 following requirements:
 
 • Without causing segregation, vibrate throughout the concrete being placed until it is uniformly
 consolidated.
 • Strike-off the concrete with templates or screeds designed and manipulated to shape the
 concrete to specified Cross Section between the forms, carrying a slight excess of concrete in
 front of the leading edge of templates or screeds at all times.
 • Following the vibrating and strike-off operations, float the concrete. Include transverse floating
 or other smoothing and finishing actions as necessary. Check and correct the surface
 according to 00756.49. Keep the surface free from laitance, soupy mortar, marks or
 irregularities.
 • Finish the surface according to 00756.49.
 00756.52 Edge Tooling and Filling - Tool edges at longitudinal contact joints and construction
 joints of new Pavement and clean joints of previously placed concrete to remove laitance and mortar
 resulting from finishing operations, and to provide clean rounded edges without ridges on the
 surface. Perform tooling of the edges of concrete Pavement so that a nominal 5/8 inch diameter
 
 777
 
 00756.53
 radius is produced. Perform tooling of edges at construction joints so that no more than a 1/8 inch
 radius is produced.
 Fill any areas of minor honeycomb or other minor defect in composition of the concrete along the
 exposed sides of concrete with a stiff mortar of cement and fine Aggregate, and apply to the
 moistened concrete to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Remove and replace areas showing serious
 defects in composition of the concrete with specified quality concrete for full Panel width between
 longitudinal joints or edges, and for a length not less than 10 feet. Low spots exceeding 1/4 inch in
 depth, if in hardened concrete, may be filled with an Epoxy Grout from the QPL provided the area is
 prepared according to grout manufacturer's directions and the filling is neat and blends
 inconspicuously with adjoining concrete.
 00756.53 Curing Concrete - Immediately after the final floating, surface finishing and edging have
 been completed, and while the concrete surface is still moist, cover and cure the entire exposed
 surface of the newly placed concrete for at least 72 hours according to one of the following
 provisions:
 (a) Liquid Membrane-Forming Compounds - Apply liquid membrane-forming compound
 uniformly to the concrete by pressure-spray methods at a rate of at least 1 gallon per 150 square
 feet. Mix the liquid membrane-forming compound thoroughly before and during use.
 (b) Other Coverings - Apply the covering to damp concrete as soon as it can be placed without
 marring the surface. Place the membrane in contact with the surface, extend beyond the sides or
 edges of the slabs or forms, and weight down as required to hold it in position as a waterproof
 and moisture-proof covering. Laps shall be sufficient to maintain tightness equivalent to the
 sheeting and use:
 (1) Polyethylene Film - Sheeting shall be clear or white.
 (2) Waterproof Paper - Transverse laps shall be at least 18 inches, and cement longitudinal
 seams.
 (3) Cotton or Jute Mats - Before placing, saturate the mats with water and keep fully wetted
 during the curing period.
 00756.54 Pavement Cracks - Within 28 days after concrete placement and before opening the
 Pavement to Public Traffic, the Engineer will perform a Pavement crack survey. Clean the
 Pavement before the crack survey. Pavement with uncontrolled longitudinal or transverse cracks
 which are visible without magnification will be considered unacceptable and be repaired or removed
 as determined by the Engineer. Perform all remedial Work at no additional cost to the Agency.
 00756.55 Surface Tolerance, Testing, and Correction - Perform straightedge testing according
 to 00756.55(a). Except as specified, when the Project exceeds 1,500 feet of continuous Pavement
 construction or when specified in the Special Provisions, conduct graphic profile testing according
 to 00756.55(b). Furnish and operate the Equipment as soon as the hardness of the concrete
 permits.
 (a) Straightedge Testing and Tolerance - Perform longitudinal and transverse smoothness
 testing of the Pavement surface with a 12-foot straightedge. The extent of the testing will be as
 the Engineer determines necessary or expedient. The Pavement surface shall not deviate from
 the straightedge at any point by more than 1/8 inch for all areas that are constructed by the
 prescribed machine methods and for all Traffic Lanes and ramps. Other areas shall not deviate
 by more than 1/4 inch. Longitudinal 12-foot straightedge testing will not be required for Pavement
 accepted under 00756.55(b).
 
 778
 
 00756.55
 (b) Graphic Profile Testing (GPT) and Tolerance:
 (1) General - Test the longitudinal surface of all Traffic Lanes, ramps Shoulders and Bridges
 for smoothness by the graphic profile method according to ODOT TM 770. Before paving
 commences on the Project, demonstrate the profilograph or profilometer operation by
 conducting a calibration test according to ODOT TM 770 and running the machine twice over
 a 0.1 mile section of Pavement with repeating results.
 a. Graphic Profile Tolerance - The Pavement shall have a profile index of 7.0 inches per
 mile or less for each wheel path in each 0.1 mile segment or partial segment, and shall have
 no individual deviation of 0.3 inch or more. On ramps, Shoulders and auxiliary lanes the
 profile index shall be 12.0 inches per mile subject to the above criteria. Bonus payment for
 smoothness will be made according to 00756.95.
 b. Daily GPT - If the average profile index exceeds 7.0 inches per mile for all segments and
 partial segments of Pavement constructed in any Day's production, discontinue paving
 operations and construct one or more test strips as described in 00756.47. The test strip
 may be comprised of Pavement placed during the shift that the shutdown is ordered, but in
 no case shall it be less than 0.1 mile in length.
 (2) Surface Test - Run the profilograph or profilometer over the full length of the Project
 and 50 feet beyond the Project ends to provide a complete graphic profile. This includes all
 concrete Traffic Lanes and auxiliary lanes.
 
 Obtain profiles on the Pavement surface along lines parallel to and approximately 3 feet from
 each edge and longitudinal joints for 12 foot wide lanes and 4 feet from each edge and
 longitudinal joints for 14 foot wide lanes. The intent is to provide a profile in each vehicle
 wheel path. Take profiles on transition areas of entrance and exit ramps as close to the wheel
 path as practicable.
 Start the profiles that represent a Day's production 50 feet before the beginning of that Day's
 production and stop 50 feet before the end of that Day's production.
 Run the profiles for each Day's production as soon as possible without damaging the surface.
 Analyze the daily GPT profiles according to 00756.55(b)(3), and give the profiles and results to
 the Engineer within 24 hours of the conclusion of the Day's production.
 (3) Determining Profile Index:
 a. General - Determine the profile index of Pavement in 0.1 mile segments and partial
 segments. Segments shall begin 13 feet into the Project and run consecutively in either the
 direction of travel or the concrete placement, as determined by the Engineer. A segment
 will end as a partial segment and a new segment will begin when the segment sequence is
 interrupted by stage construction or by profiled areas excluded from the GPT smoothness
 requirements.
 
 The following profiled areas of Pavement are excluded from the GPT smoothness
 requirements:
 • Profiles extending beyond the Project ends.
 • Bridge decks and bridge panels.
 • First and last 13 feet at the Project ends and bridge end panels.
 • Pavement on horizontal curves with radii less than 1,000 feet.
 
 779
 
 00756.56
 Include and analyze separately those areas in the profile charts that are not subject to the
 GPT smoothness profile index requirements.
 b. Method of Analysis - Determine the profile index and individual deviations of 0.3 inch or
 more by analyzing the profile charts according to ODOT TM 770 and provide the profile
 charts and results to the Engineer for review.
 c. Profile Index - The profile index is the inches per mile in excess of the 0.2 inch blanking
 band. The formula for converting counts to profile index is:
 
 Profile Index =
 
 Total Count x 0.10
 Length of Full 0.10 Mile Segment or of Partial
 
 *
 
 Mile Segment
 
 * Report to the nearest 0.01 mile
 (c) Correcting Deficiencies - Should testing described in 00756.49, 00756.51, and 00756.55
 show the Pavement does not conform to the prescribed limits of deviation, the following shall
 apply:
 (1) Failure To Meet Straightedge Requirements:
 a. Plastic Concrete - If the requirements of 00756.49 or 00756.51 are not met, stop the
 paving operations until revised methods, changes in Equipment, or correction of procedures
 are made or proposed for trial, and are approved by the Engineer for trial. Also stop those
 revisions, changes and corrections if they do not produce a specified surface.
 b. Hardened Concrete - If the requirements of 00756.51 or 00756.55(a) are not met,
 correct according to 00756.55(c)(2)(a) or 00756.55(c)(2)(b) and retest.
 (2) Failure To Meet Graphic Profile Requirements - Correct any segment or partial segment
 that exceeds the requirements of 00756.55(b) in either wheel path by one of the methods listed
 below to the specified limits except correct deviations of 0.3 inch or more at least to the edge
 of the blanking band:
 a. Remove the non-specification concrete Pavement as determined by the Engineer and
 replace with specification concrete Pavement.
 b. Profile with abrasive grinders, equipped with a cutting head comprised of multiple
 diamond blades. The Engineer will determine and mark the areas to be profiled. For all
 areas corrected by grinding, restore the required surface texture as specified in 00756.49(b)
 by transverse sawing with diamond blade saws.
 
 Retest their entire length, according to 00756.55(b), all segments requiring corrective Work
 with the profilograph or profilometer under the supervision of the Engineer. Perform all
 corrective Work and graphic profiling, including traffic control, at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 00756.56 Pavement Thickness - Construct the Pavement to the thickness shown. Pavement not
 so constructed will be subject to replacement according to 00756.57, or to payment at adjusted
 prices according to 00756.93.
 (a) Sticking Measurements - Determine conformance with minimum thickness requirements by
 random sticking measurements of the plastic concrete according to ODOT TM 775 under the
 Engineer's observation. Report thickness to the nearest 0.1 inch.
 
 780
 
 00756.56
 Divide the Panel into units and partial units equivalent to a maximum of 200 lane feet. Normally,
 unit lengths will be 200 feet for one lane, 100 feet for two lanes, 70 feet for three lanes and as
 appropriate for transition areas. When directed, take one sticking measurement at a randomly
 selected location in each unit and partial unit. Record measurements to the nearest 0.1 inch.
 Take the measurements:
 • After consolidation and screeding and before the float finish.
 • No closer than 2 feet from the Panel edges.
 • Within 10 feet longitudinally and 1 foot transversely from the calculated random location
 determined by the Engineer.
 If a sticking is not obtained for a unit or a partial unit, or is not available to represent the area of
 Pavement remaining after the limits of Pavement over 1.0 inch deficient is determined, the
 measurement will be assumed to be the same as the preceding or following sticking
 measurement, that is nearest in distance.
 (b) Thickness 0.5 Inch Deficient - If a survey depth measurement indicates the Pavement is
 0.5 inch or more deficient in thickness, stop forward paving progress until appropriate
 adjustments are made or corrective action is taken.
 (c) Coring Requirements - Perform required coring, or coring requested by the Engineer
 according to AASHTO T 24 and repair core holes as directed, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Cores will be measured by the Engineer according to AASHTO T 148 and the measurements
 reported to the nearest 0.1 inch. Core measurements will replace survey methods.
 (1) Corrective Grinding Areas - If corrective grinding required by 00756.55(c) is performed at
 a 00756.56(a) depth measurement site, a core shall be obtained at the surveyed measurement
 site according to the following:
 a. Profile Indexes 7.0 Inches Per Mile or Less - If the original profile indexes for a
 segment or partial segment determined by 00756.55 is 7.0 inches per mile or less in each
 wheel path, a core is not required after corrective grinding is performed at a depth
 measurement site within the segment or partial segment represented by the profile indexes.
 b. Profile Index Greater Than 7.0 Inches Per Mile - If an original graphic profile index for
 a segment or partial segment determined by 00756.55 is more than 7.0 inches per mile for a
 wheel path, obtain a core, after corrective grinding has been performed, at a depth
 measurement site within the segment or partial segment represented by the profile indexes
 if the depth measurement is the specified depth or less.
 (2) Cores Requested By Contractor - If the Contractor believes that a depth measurement
 determined according to 00756.56(a), or a core obtained according to 00756.56(c), is not
 representative of the actual Pavement thickness, the Contractor may take a replacement core.
 Take replacement cores at a location as directed, 10 feet from the depth measurement or core
 site in question and the same distance from centerline. The replacement core measurement
 will replace the original depth or core measurement.
 (d) Thickness Over 1.0 Inch Deficient - If a depth measurement determined according
 to 00756.56(a) shows Pavement over 1.0 inch deficient, obtain a core at the depth measurement
 site. If this core, or a core determined by 00756.56(c), shows Pavement over 1.0 inch deficient,
 obtain additional cores. Take these additional cores at the same distance from the centerline and
 at 25 foot intervals each direction from the first core until a core in each direction shows
 Pavement 1.0 inch deficient or less. These two core locations will be considered the limits of the
 Pavement more than 1.0 inch deficient. The Pavement Panel between these two cores will
 
 781
 
 00756.57
 represent the area of Pavement subject to removal and replacement under 00756.57 or no
 payment under 00756.93.
 When it is suspected by the Engineer that the Pavement in the adjacent travel lanes in the Panel
 may be more than 1.0 inch deficient for a greater distance than determined by the above
 procedure, core the Pavement in the adjacent travel lanes in the nearest wheel track (3 feet from
 the nearest edge) opposite both limit cores. If these cores are more than 1.0 inch deficient, the
 above procedure shall be followed to determine the limits.
 00756.57 Deficient Pavement - Remove and replace Pavement deficient in thickness by more
 than 1.0 inch, according to 00756.56(d), at no additional cost to the Agency. If allowed by the
 Engineer, the Pavement may be left in place without payment. Replacement Pavement shall be of
 the specified design, quality and thickness as follows:
 
 • Be the full width of the Pavement Panel involved.
 • Extend far enough to replace at least a 20 foot length.
 • Extend to the construction joint if closer than 20 feet to a construction joint.
 Maintenance
 00756.60 Protection of Concrete - Repair or replace any part of the Pavement damaged by traffic
 or damaged from any other cause before its official acceptance, according to 00170.80.
 
 Do not operate construction Equipment on newly placed concrete until the requirements of (a), (b),
 and (c) are met. Do not allow Public Traffic on newly placed concrete until all of the following
 requirements are met:
 (a) The Contractor complies with 00150.60.
 (b) The concrete attains a compressive strength of at least 70 percent of the specified 28-Day
 strength as determined by testing at least three cylinders cured according to AASHTO T 23 (field
 cure) and tested according to AASHTO T 22.
 
 The maturity method, AASHTO T 325, may be used to estimate concrete strength for opening
 Pavement to construction traffic. Install at least two maturity thermocouples for each Day's
 placement in areas where the maturity method will be used for early opening. Install the
 thermocouples near the Day's final placement for areas being evaluated for early opening.
 When the maturity method is used, the Engineer may verify the maturity method with strength
 specimens. Establish a new strength-maturity relationship if strength specimens deviate more
 than 10 percent from the maturity-estimated strengths. Suspend use of the maturity method for
 opening Pavements to traffic when the strength-maturity relationship deviates by more
 than 10 percent until a new strength maturity relationship is established.
 (c) The surface of the concrete is protected from scarring or abrasion and kept free of stones,
 loose mortar and other matter apt to be deleterious to the concrete in the paths of Equipment.
 (d) The Pavement meets all of the requirements of 00756.55.
 Measurement
 00756.80 Measurement - The quantities of concrete Pavement will be measured on the area basis.
 The area will be determined by measuring the width and length of each separately constructed
 Panel of Pavement. The width is the design width or measured edge-to-edge width on the surface
 
 782
 
 00756.93
 of the Pavement whichever is less. The length is the horizontal measurement from end to end of
 Pavement along the center line of the strip.
 The measurement of extra thickness of Pavement, as shown or as ordered, will be determined by
 conversion on a proportionate volume basis to an equivalent number of square yards of specified
 thickness Pavement.
 Payment
 00756.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of plain concrete Pavement will be paid for at the
 Contract unit price, per unit of measurement for the following items:
 Pay Item
 
 (a)
 (b)
 
 Unit of Measurement
 
 Plain Concrete Pavement, Undowelled, ____ Inches Thick ............ Square Yard
 Plain Concrete Pavement, Dowelled, ____ Inches Thick................ Square Yard
 
 The thickness of Pavement will be inserted in the blank.
 Payment will be payment in full for furnishing and placing all Materials, and for furnishing all
 Equipment, labor, and Incidentals necessary to complete the Work as specified.
 No separate or additional payment will be made for construction joint reinforcement bars, tie bars,
 dowel bars, curing materials, and saw cutting.
 00756.92 Price Adjustment for Strength - For each lot of concrete for which a PF is determined,
 the following will apply:
 
 • In no case will the actual payment exceed the Contract Unit Price.
 • When the PF is less than 1.00, the price adjustment will be determined as follows:
 Price Adjustment = 0.3 x (PF - 1) x Unit Price
 00756.93 Price Adjustment for Variation in Thickness - No additional payment over the Contract
 unit price will be made for Pavement having a thickness greater than shown or ordered by the
 Engineer. When the Pavement is found deficient in thickness by more than 0.2 inch, but not more
 than 1.0 inch, as determined according to 00756.56, payment will be made at an adjusted price
 according to the following table:
 Deficiency in
 Thickness (inch)
 
 Proportional Part of Contract
 Unit Price Allowed
 
 0.00 to 0.20
 0.21 to 0.30
 0.31 to 0.40
 0.41 to 0.50
 0.51 to 0.75
 0.76 to 1.00
 
 100%
 83%
 76%
 73%
 63%
 59%
 
 No payment will be made for any area of Pavement found deficient in thickness by more
 than 1.0 inch even though such Pavement is allowed by the Engineer to remain in place under the
 provisions of 00756.57.
 
 783
 
 00756.95
 00756.95 Bonus Payment for Smoothness - If a profilograph or profilometer is used according
 to 00756.55 a bonus payment of up to 1.5 percent will be made to the Contractor for each 0.1 mile
 segment or partial segment of Pavement except Shoulders, as determined in 00756.55(b) if:
 
 • The profile index for each wheel path is 7.0 inches per mile or less.
 • No individual deviation is 0.3 inch or more.
 • The average of the two profile indexes is less than 5.0 inches per mile.
 • These requirements are met without any corrective action specified in 00756.55(c).
 The bonus payment for each segment and partial segment meeting the above requirements will be
 computed as follows:
 Bonus = 0.006 x (5.0 - PI) x Quantity x Unit Price
 PI = Average of the two profile indexes in the segment or partial segment (inches per mile)
 Quantity = The quantity (square yards) represented by the segment or partial segment
 Unit Price = The unit price for the concrete Pavement as shown in the Contract Schedule of Items

 at least 7 Calendar Days.
 
 801
 
 00820.44
 (2) Latex Paint Cure - If approved, barrier may be cured with latex paint, using the following
 procedures:
 
 • Allow free moisture to flash off, but only until the concrete surface does not glisten, and
 never for more than 1 hour.
 • Apply latex paint from the QPL as follows:
 • Apply first coat at an application rate of 150 square feet per gallon.
 • Allow first coat to air dry for 1 hour.
 • Apply second coat at the same rate as above, with application direction transverse to
 the direction that the first coat was applied.
 Barriers cured in this manner will be considered to have met the surface finishing requirements
 of 00820.45 except that additional coats may be necessary to provide uniform coverage and
 appearance to correct construction damage.
 (b) Precast Barriers - Cure precast concrete surfaces by one of the following methods:
 (1) Water Cure - Water cure concrete surfaces by covering with burlap, canvas or other
 satisfactory material and keep moist for at least 7 Calendar Days.
 (2) Steam Cure - Steam curing can be substituted for water curing if done under a suitable
 enclosure constructed to contain live steam and to minimize moisture and heat loss. The
 steam shall be at 100 percent relative humidity to prevent loss of moisture and to provide
 excess moisture for proper hydration of cement. Do not apply the steam directly to the
 concrete.
 
 Equip the steam supply line to the enclosure with a motor-operated, modulating steam control
 valve operated by a temperature-sensing element that measures the temperature within the
 enclosure. Distribute the steam within the enclosure through suitable ports located on each
 side of the enclosure at not more than 30 foot centers, or closer if necessary, to keep the units
 being cured completely and uniformly surrounded with live steam.
 Equip the enclosure with a 24-hour recording thermometer, and record the temperature on a
 single chart for each 24-hour period.
 Apply the steam after the initial set of the concrete as determined by ASTM C403. Continue
 steam curing until the barrier concrete reaches a minimum compressive strength of 2,000 psi
 as determined by Contractor test cylinders or as approved.
 00820.44 Joints for Cast-in-Place Concrete Barriers:
 (a) Construction Joints - Make construction joints at an expansion or contraction joint location.
 If the placement of the barrier is stopped at a normal contraction joint location, construct an
 expansion joint at that location, before proceeding with the placement of the barrier, as shown.
 (b) Contraction Joints - Score or saw contraction joints before initial set to the depth and width
 shown.
 (c) Expansion Joints - Fill expansion joints with a preformed joint filler. Place the filler in correct
 position on one side of the joint before placing concrete on the other side.
 00820.45 Surface Finishing - After stripping forms and while the concrete is still green, remove all
 fins and form marks, and repair all rock pockets and holes having a surface opening over 3/8 inch in
 diameter with portland cement grout conforming to 02080.40. Prevent grout from drying
 
 802
 
 00820.90
 prematurely. Additional finishing after precast concrete barrier is set in its permanent position may
 be required to present a surface of uniform texture and appearance.
 Coat the top and sides of all permanent barriers with a minimum of two coats of a latex paint from
 the QPL. Use additional coats as necessary to provide uniform coverage and appearance. Clean
 and thoroughly saturate with water the surfaces to be coated. Coat while damp. The second coat
 may be applied when the previous coat does not adhere to the fingers when touched lightly.
 00820.47 Replacement or Price Reduction - Remove and replace barrier represented by
 cylinders that fail to meet the minimum strength requirement, at no additional cost to the Agency. If
 the Engineer determines the low-strength barrier is suitable for the purpose intended, the barrier
 may be accepted according to 00150.25.
 00820.48 Inspection - Fabrication of barrier outside of the State of Oregon creates additional
 inspection costs to the Agency. The Contractor's payment for barrier will be reduced according
 to 00165.91.
 Measurement
 00820.80 Measurement - The quantities of concrete barrier will be measured on the length basis,
 according to the following:
 
 • Cast-In-Place Barriers - Cast-in-place barrier will be measured along the line and grade of
 each separate run, including terminal sections and transition sections.

 00921.43 Drilled Shaft Excavation - Perform drilled shaft excavation according to the following:
 (a) General - Excavate drilled shafts to the dimensions and elevations shown or as directed.
 Provide and maintain stabilized drilled shaft sidewalls and bottoms for the full depth of the
 excavation, using approved materials, Equipment and methods. If caving or other unstable
 conditions occur during any construction procedure, stop further construction, notify the Engineer,
 and stabilize the shaft excavation by approved methods and submit a revised installation plan
 which addresses the problem and prevents further instability. Do not continue with shaft
 construction until any damage which occurred has been repaired according to the Specifications
 and until receiving the Engineer's approval of the revised shaft installation plan.
 
 If the Engineer has reason to believe that the drilled shaft excavation techniques or workmanship
 have been deficient, so that the integrity of any excavation is in question, Work on that drilled
 shaft may be stopped. Drilled shaft excavation will not be allowed to resume until the deficient
 excavation techniques or workmanship have been changed to the Engineer's satisfaction.
 Dispose of materials removed from the shaft excavations according to 00290.20.
 Do not leave partially completed shaft excavations open overnight unless they are cased full
 depth or otherwise stabilized with approved methods. If approved by the Engineer, a partially
 excavated shaft may be left open overnight, provided that the excavation:
 • Is stabilized at the bottom, sides and surface to prevent Soil caving or swelling or a
 reduction of Soil strength, and
 • Is covered at the surface to protect the public.
 Extend the drilled shaft excavation if the Engineer determines that the subsurface materials
 encountered are not capable of providing the required bearing resistance or differ from those
 anticipated in the design of the drilled shafts.
 (b) Protection of Existing Structures - Control shaft construction operations to prevent
 damage to existing Structures and utilities. Preventive measures include, but are not limited to,
 selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent caving of the shaft excavation
 and monitoring and controlling the vibrations from construction activities such as the driving and
 vibrating of casing or sheeting, drilling of the shaft, or from blasting, if blasting is allowed. Repair
 all damage caused to existing Structures, utilities or other facilities, resulting from drilled shaft
 construction activities, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (c) Temporary Casing - Provide temporary casing according to the approved installation plan
 and of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the anticipated construction method.
 (d) Unexpected Drilled Shaft Obstructions - Remove any natural or manmade object
 encountered that was not revealed by the Agency's site investigation, and that would cause a
 significant decrease in the rate of advancement if removed using the techniques and Equipment
 used successfully to excavate the shaft. The Engineer will be the sole judge of the significance of
 any reduced rate of shaft advancement and the classification of any unexpected obstructions.
 Removal of unexpected obstructions from the shaft excavation will be paid according
 to 00195.20.
 (e) Lost Tools - Promptly remove drilling tools lost in the excavation. Lost tools will not be
 considered unexpected obstructions and shall be removed without additional compensation.
 
 842
 
 00921.43
 Drilling tools lost during the course of removing unexpected drilled shaft obstructions will be paid
 according to 00195.20.
 (f) Drilling Slurry Installation - If synthetic drilling slurry is selected, provide a manufacturer's
 representative to provide technical assistance at the site prior to use of the slurry, who shall
 remain at the site during construction and completion of a minimum of one drilled shaft to adjust
 the slurry mix for the specific site subsurface conditions. After the manufacturer's representative
 is no longer at the site, provide the approved personnel trained in the use of the synthetic slurry
 for the remainder of the shaft slurry operations to supervise the proper slurry mix design and
 quality control procedures.
 
 All in-hole drilling slurry shall meet the required slurry Specifications during excavation and prior
 to concrete placement. Clean, recirculate, de-sand or replace the slurry to maintain the required
 slurry properties.
 Unless otherwise approved, maintain the level of slurry in the excavation at not less than 5 feet
 above the groundwater level for mineral slurries or 10 feet above the groundwater level for
 synthetic or water slurries. Maintain the slurry level a sufficient distance above all unstable zones
 to prevent bottom heave, caving or sloughing.
 Maintain the required slurry properties and levels at all times during shaft construction, including
 work stoppages, unless other approved stabilization methods are applied.
 Feed slurry continuously into the shaft excavation as drilling progresses so that a stable
 excavation is maintained. Use a self-priming pump to reclaim the slurry. Keep a standby pump
 available during the drilling operation.
 (g) Drilling Slurry Inspection and Testing - Mix and thoroughly hydrate all drilling slurries in an
 appropriate storage facility. Collect sample sets from the storage facility and perform tests to
 ensure the slurry conforms to the specified material properties before introduction into the drilled
 shaft excavation. A sample set shall be composed of samples taken at mid-depth and within
 24 inches of the bottom of the storage facility.
 
 Sample and test all slurry in the presence of the Engineer, unless otherwise directed. The
 sample sets of slurry within the excavation shall consist of samples taken at mid-depth of the
 excavation and within 24 inches of the bottom of the excavation. Collect and test sample sets
 during the drilling operation as necessary to ensure the specified properties of the slurry are
 maintained. Clean, recirculate, de-sand, or replace the slurry as necessary to maintain the
 specified slurry properties. Final cleaning of the excavation and placement of concrete will not be
 allowed until the test results indicate the slurry properties are as specified.
 Perform a minimum of two sets of slurry tests per 8-hour work shift, the first test being done at the
 beginning of the shift. Field conditions may require more frequent testing to ensure acceptable
 slurry properties.
 Make copies of all slurry test results available to the Engineer on request.
 (h) Clean Out - Use appropriate means, such as a cleanout bucket, pump or air lift, to clean the
 bottom of the drilled shaft excavations. No more than 1 inch of loose or disturbed material will be
 allowed at the bottom of the excavation.
 
 Notify the Engineer of completion of each drilled shaft excavation to permit inspection before
 proceeding with construction. Measure final shaft depths with a suitable weighted tape or other
 approved method after final cleaning to determine that the shaft bottom meets the requirements
 
 843
 
 00921.45
 in the Contract. Do not proceed with shaft construction until the bottom cleanliness requirements
 have been met and the bottom (shaft tip) elevation is approved.
 00921.45 Reinforcing Steel - Furnish and place reinforcing steel as shown and according to the
 following:
 (a) Placement - Do not place reinforcing steel in the shaft excavation until the Engineer has
 approved the final elevation of the bottom of the shaft.
 
 In each shaft, place reinforcing steel to the top elevation shown. Support the reinforcing cage to
 prevent distortion or settlement during concrete placement. Support the reinforcing cage such
 that the supporting mechanism does not obstruct the center of the shaft and allows concrete
 placement vertically down the center of the shaft. If concrete placement does not immediately
 follow cage placement, remove the reinforcing cage from the excavation and rectify the integrity
 of the excavation prior to reinstallation of the cage.
 (b) Bracing - Rigidly brace the reinforcing cage to retain its shape for lifting. Lift the cage in a
 manner that does not cause permanent racking or distortion. Show bracing and any extra
 reinforcing steel required for fabrication of the cage on the submitted shop drawings. Remove
 cross bracing during cage placement unless otherwise approved.
 (c) Splicing - Splice all drilled shaft reinforcement using approved mechanical splicer's unless
 otherwise shown or approved.
 (d) Concrete Cover - Maintain the required concrete cover shown by placing concentric spacer
 bars or other approved devices around the reinforcing cage. Place spacing devices on minimum
 10 foot vertical spacings the full length of the shaft. At each 10 foot level, place spacers on a
 minimum 30 inch circumferential spacing with at least three spaces per level. Do not use wood
 spacers or concrete dobies. Provide details of the proposed centering method on the shop
 drawings submitted according to 00921.40.
 00921.46 Crosshole Sonic Log Test Access Tubes - Furnish and install access tubes for CSL
 testing as shown. Attach CSL access tubes securely to the interior of the reinforcement cage as
 near to parallel as possible in each drilled shaft and in the pattern shown. Extend the access tubes
 from the bottom of the reinforcement cage to at least 24 inches above the top of the shaft. Joints
 required to achieve full-length access tubes shall be watertight. Do not damage the access tubes
 during reinforcement cage installation and concrete placement. Fill the tubes with potable water,
 according to 02020.10(b), as soon as possible, but no more than 1 hour after concrete placement
 and reinstall the top watertight caps. Check water level and top off as needed.
 
 Replace all access tubes that the test probe cannot pass through to the full depth of the shaft at no
 additional cost to the Agency. Replace all damaged access tubes with 1.5 to 2.0 inch diameter holes
 cored through the concrete for the entire length of the shaft. Unless otherwise directed, locate
 replacement core holes approximately 6 inches inside the reinforcement. Do not damage the shaft
 reinforcement during coring operations.
 Fill the access tubes with grout only after all CSL testing has been completed and the shaft has
 been accepted.
 00921.47 Concrete - Furnish and place concrete according to the following:
 (a) Concrete Placement - Place concrete immediately after completion of the shaft excavation
 and with the approval of the Engineer. Prior to concrete placement, ensure the shaft clean-out
 requirements are met according to 00921.43(h) and the properties of the slurry, if used, conform
 
 844
 
 00921.47
 to the Specifications. Shaft concrete may be placed without mechanical vibration in those areas
 of the drilled shaft that are not formed or are below the ground line or the water surface.
 Place concrete continuously until concrete at the top of the shaft is free of water, Soil, and debris,
 and uncontaminated concrete extends to the plan top-of-shaft elevation. Dispose of all
 contaminated concrete expelled from the top of the shaft in an approved manner. Remove waste
 concrete from the site. If a delay in concrete placement occurs because of a delay in concrete
 delivery or other factors, reduce the placement rate to maintain a flow of fresh concrete into the
 shaft excavation.
 Allow a maximum of 60 minutes between concrete placements and use no concrete older than
 90 minutes from batch time. Use procedures for concrete placement which ensure that the
 concrete within the shaft becomes a monolithic, homogeneous unit.
 Place concrete using hoses or pipes having watertight joints. For concrete placement by gravity
 tremie, use hose or pipe having an inside diameter of at least 8 inches. For placement by
 concrete pump, use hose with inside diameter of at least 4 inches. Provide an alternate delivery
 system that can be used in case of failure of the primary delivery system. Place concrete only
 against the bottom of the drilled shaft or into fresh concrete.
 If caving occurs during concrete placement, the shaft may be rejected.
 (b) Dry Shaft Concrete Placement - Concrete may be placed by free-fall if all of the following
 conditions are met:
 
 • No more than 3 inches of water is present in the bottom of the excavation at the beginning
 of the pour.
 • Groundwater seepage into the excavation is at a rate of no more than 12 inches per hour.
 • Shaft diameter is greater than or equal to 3 feet.
 Under free-fall placement, deposit concrete through the center of the reinforcement cage by a
 method which prevents segregation of Aggregates and splashing of concrete on the
 reinforcement cage. Place concrete so that the free-fall is vertical down the center of the shaft
 without hitting the sides, the steel reinforcing bars or steel cage bracing.
 (c) Wet Shaft Concrete Placement - If the drilled shaft excavation does not meet the
 requirements for dry concrete placement, stabilize water inflow and place the concrete under
 water or slurry with a tremie pipe or pump hose according to 00540.48(e). Place concrete
 continuously from the bottom of the shaft to the top-of-shaft elevation shown. Use a plug in the
 tremie pipe or pump hose to force water or slurry ahead of the advancing flow of fresh concrete.
 Dispose of all displaced water, slurry, or waste concrete according to 00290.20. When
 groundwater, the drilling water or slurry in the shaft excavation is to be removed by pumping
 during concrete placement, have a standby pump available.
 
 Place concrete in a continuous operation so that the concrete always flows upward within the
 shaft. Withdraw the delivery hose or pipe slowly as the elevation of the fresh concrete rises in the
 shaft. Keep the discharge end of the pipe or hose at least 5 feet below the surface of the
 concrete after the concrete has reached a depth of 5 feet. Maintain sufficient concrete inside the
 hose or pipe to prevent drilling fluid from entering. During concrete placement, provide and
 maintain markings on the tremie pipe or pump hose, or a sounding device or other appropriate
 method to determine the relative elevations of the fresh concrete surface and the bottom end of
 the pipe or hose. Raise the bottom end of the pipe or hose only when the pipe or hose has a
 sufficient head of fresh concrete to prevent the formation of a void at the bottom.
 
 845
 
 00921.48
 (d) Concrete Curing and Cleaning - Allow the exposed top of concrete to cure a minimum
 of 7 Calendar Days by covering with wet burlap overlain with plastic sheets or by keeping top of
 concrete under water. Keep the burlap wet during the concrete cure.
 
 Prior to placing any fresh concrete on top of a completed shaft, clean the upper surface of the
 concrete by removing all scum, laitance, loose gravel, and sediment and chip off any high spots
 on the upper surface that would prevent the steel reinforcing bar cage from being properly placed
 in the position shown on the Plans. Remove all loose material and poor quality concrete at the
 top of the shaft down to sound concrete prior to performing any required CSL testing.
 (e) Casing Removal - Remove all temporary casing during or after completion of concrete
 placement. Do not start temporary casing removal until the level of fresh concrete within the
 casing has reached a depth of at least 10 feet or the level necessary to adequately counteract the
 external hydrostatic pressure head. As the temporary casing is withdrawn, maintain a minimum
 5 feet head of concrete above the bottom of the casing. A slight downward movement of the
 casing while exerting downward pressure, or hammering or vibrating the casing will be allowed to
 facilitate extraction. Extract the casing so that concrete is cast directly against the surrounding insitu material. Check the elevation of the top of the reinforcing cage before and after temporary
 casing extraction for conformance with the construction tolerance criteria of 00921.42. Casing
 that cannot be extracted during, or immediately after, the concrete placement operation may be
 cause for rejection of the shaft.
 00921.48 Drilled Shaft Testing and Acceptance - Acceptance of drilled shafts will be based on
 the Engineer's review of the results of CSL, or other, integrity testing if conducted, field inspection
 reports and visual observations during drilled shaft construction. The Engineer has final authority on
 the approval of drilled shafts. For shafts that are integrity tested, the Engineer will determine final
 acceptance of each tested shaft, based on the integrity test results and inspection reports and will
 provide a response to the Contractor within 5 Calendar Days after receiving the CSL test report.
 (a) Crosshole Sonic Log Testing - Provide crosshole sonic log testing Equipment and perform
 crosshole sonic log testing and analysis on the first drilled shaft completed at each foundation
 and subsequent shafts as specified or designated for testing by the Engineer. Provide CSL
 testing Equipment conforming to the requirements of ASTM D6760 and approved by the
 Engineer. Provide all necessary access and other support to the CSL testing firm necessary to
 do the CSL testing Work.
 
 Perform one CSL test on each shaft designated for testing. A single CSL test consists of all
 ultrasonic profile combinations in a given shaft. Test completed drilled shaft foundations using
 Ultrasonic Crosshole Testing methods ((CSL) Testing) according to ASTM D6760. Inform the
 Engineer of scheduled CSL testing at least 3 Calendar Days prior to the testing. Perform all CSL
 testing using the Contractor's CSL technician in the presence of the Engineer.
 Allow at least 3 Calendar Days of curing time before testing unless otherwise approved.
 Additional curing time beyond 3 Calendar Days may be required if the shaft concrete contains
 admixtures such as set retarding admixture or water reducing admixture. Additional CSL testing
 required due to the CSL testing being conducted on concrete that has not cured sufficiently is at
 no additional cost to the Agency. Additional curing time required due to concrete admixtures will
 not be grounds for additional compensation or time extensions.
 (b) Contractor's Crosshole Sonic Log Test Reports - Provide a brief summary report of the
 data, with interpretation of the test results, to the Engineer at the completion of each test. Provide
 copies, either hardcopies or electronic files, of the raw test data as requested. Mark the test data
 files to identify, as a minimum, the Structure, bent and shaft number, the date of CSL testing,
 depths of testing and any other pertinent information.
 
 846
 
 00921.49
 Submit three copies of a final CSL Test Report for each shaft tested according to ASTM D6760.
 Provide electronic file copies of the raw CSL data measurements compatible with the Cross Hole
 Ultrasonic Monitor (CHUM) program, if requested. The report shall summarize the CSL testing
 performed, data analysis, and interpretation of CSL data with special attention made to the
 identification and location of any anomalies or possible defects. Provide interpretation of the CSL
 test data in terms of overall shaft integrity and acceptance. Submit all reports to the Engineer
 within 5 Calendar Days of the performance of the tests.
 (c) Additional Testing and Investigation - Conduct additional testing or investigation
 necessary to identify the location, extent and condition of possible shaft defects if requested by
 the Engineer. Additional testing and investigation may include, but is not limited to, additional
 CSL testing, excavation Work or core drilling.
 If requested by the Engineer, drill a core hole in any questionable quality shaft to explore the shaft
 condition. The number, location and depths of the core holes will be determined by the Engineer.
 Submit the method and Equipment used to drill and remove cores from the shaft to the Engineer
 for review and approval prior to drilling. Use a coring method that provides complete core
 recovery and minimizes abrasion and erosion of the core. If a defect is confirmed, as determined
 by the Engineer, all investigation costs associated with identifying the defect will be at no
 additional cost to the Agency and no extension of the Project completion date will be granted,
 regardless of whether the identified defect is repaired or not.
 If no defect is identified in the investigation Work, and the CSL tubes were satisfactorily installed
 according to ASTM D6760 and accepted, the Agency will pay for all coring and excavation costs
 associated with the additional investigation and grant an appropriate time extension, if required,
 according to Section 00190 and Section 00195. If it is determined by the Engineer that the CSL
 tubes were not installed properly thus invalidating the CSL test results, all coring, excavation, and
 other investigation and evaluation costs will be at no additional cost to the Agency and no
 extension of the Project completion date will be granted.
 Fill all core holes with grout only after the evaluation process is completed and the shaft is
 accepted and approved.
 (d) Drilled Shaft Repair - Repair all defects and rejected shafts according to 00921.40(b).
 Perform additional CSL testing, or other investigation required, as directed by the Engineer, to
 confirm the quality of the completed shaft repair Work at no additional cost to the Agency with no
 time extension granted.
 For temporary casing not extracted from the shaft excavation, submit a repair plan or a structural
 evaluation to the Engineer for approval according to 00921.40. If caving occurs during concrete
 placement submit a repair plan to the Engineer for approval.
 00921.49 Scheduling and Restrictions - Unless otherwise approved, do not proceed with
 construction of subsequent shafts until the CSL testing has been completed on the first drilled shaft
 and the results have been approved and accepted, in writing by the Engineer. Approval to proceed
 with the construction of subsequent shafts, before receiving approval of the first shaft will be based
 on the Engineer's observations of the Contractor's workmanship during construction of the first shaft
 and the Engineer's review and assessment of the following:
 • The Contractor's conformance with the approved shaft installation plan.
 
 • The Contractor's daily reports and Inspector's daily logs of excavation, rebar, and concrete
 placement.
 • The concrete placement logs and volume curves.
 
 847
 
 00921.80
 Written notification will be provided to the Contractor on whether or not to proceed with subsequent
 shaft construction within 24 hours after completion of the first shaft. If the Engineer determines the
 first shaft to be of questionable quality, discontinue all shaft construction until the CSL test results of
 the first shaft are received and reviewed and the shaft accepted, in writing, by the Engineer.
 Denial of permission to proceed with subsequent shaft construction will not be cause for Contract
 Time extension.
 Do not proceed with the third drilled shaft until the final CSL test results from the first drilled shaft
 has been received and reviewed and the shaft accepted, in writing, by the Engineer.
 After the first drilled shaft on the Project has been accepted, make no significant changes in
 construction methods, Equipment, or materials used to construct subsequent shafts, unless
 otherwise approved.
 Measurement
 00921.80 Measurement - The quantities of Work performed under this Section will be measured on
 the length basis, by the vertical excavated length from the bottom of the shaft to the ground surface.
 If directed to construct drilled shafts below the elevations shown, the drilled shaft will be measured
 from the revised bottom of shaft.
 
 The estimated quantities of materials for the sign support drilled shaft foundations will be listed in
 the Special Provisions.
 Payment
 00921.90 Payment - The accepted quantities of Work performed under this Section will be paid for
 at the Contract unit price, per foot for the item "____ Inch Diameter Sign Support Drilled Shaft

 (a) General - Erect breakaway sign posts, pipe sign posts and pipe support columns at a true
 vertical.
 Where two or more posts are required to support a sign, orient and position both posts so that no
 twist or warp will be imparted to the sign panels.
 (b) Assembly of Metal - Accurately assemble the parts as shown on the Plans and follow any
 match marks. Handle the material carefully so that no parts will be bent, broken or otherwise
 damaged. Clean bearing surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent contact before the members
 are assembled. Roughen faying surfaces of slip-critical structural connections utilizing high
 strength bolts by means of hand wire brushing after galvanizing. Power wire brushing is not
 allowed.

 called out in Section 5.15 WELDED CONNECTIONS in AASHTO "Standard Specifications for
 851
 
 00930.40
 Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals". Submit all Procedure
 Qualification Records, Welding Procedure Specifications, and testing procedures for Engineer's
 review prior to starting manufacturing. Submit certified copies of inspection reports to the
 Engineer for review.
 If requested by the Engineer, additional weld inspection may be required upon arrival of the
 material at the job site. If defects are found by this additional inspection, the Contractor shall be
 responsible for the additional testing and repair costs. If no defects are found, the Engineer will
 be responsible for the additional inspection costs.
 (d) Bolt Installation - Do not reuse galvanized high strength bolts. Other high strength bolts
 may be reused, if approved, but not more than once. Retightening previously tightened bolts that
 may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts will not be considered a reuse.
 
 Provide all high strength bolts with hardened washers under the element (nut or bolt head) turned
 in tightening. If a high strength bolt is installed in an oversized or short slotted hole in an outer
 ply, use a hardened washer. If a high strength bolt is installed in a long slotted hole in an outer
 ply, use a plate washer or a continuous bar made of structural grade steel at least 5/16 inch thick
 with standard holes. Make the washer or bar sufficiently large to completely cover the slot after
 installation.
 Protect fasteners from dirt and moisture at the jobsite. Do not remove the lubricant that is present
 in as-delivered condition. Clean and relubricate fasteners that accumulate dirt according
 to 02560.70.
 (1) Bolt Installation for Slip Bases (Breakaway) - Furnish, at no additional cost to the
 Agency, a calibrated torque wrench of a capacity appropriate to the size of the high-strength
 bolts installed and tightened. Confirm the accuracy of the calibrated torque wrench through
 calibration by an approved testing agency at least once a year.
 
 Remove any dirt and moisture from the lubricated fasteners, and recoat the lubricated
 fasteners with a fresh, second coat of lubricant immediately before tightening. Tighten the
 bolts, in the presence of the Engineer, to the minimum torque or tension shown to seat the
 bolts in the base plate slots. After all the bolts in the slip base are tightened, loosen each bolt
 and retighten to the prescribed torque or tension shown in the same order as the initial
 tightening.
 (2) Bolt Installation for Slip-Critical Connections - Tighten high strength bolts by direct
 tension indicator method unless noted otherwise. The calibrated torque wrench method of
 final tightening is not acceptable. Use of direct tension indicators is not allowed with Type 3
 high-strength bolts in AASHTO M 270, Grade 50W (ASTM A709, Grade 50W; ASTM A588),
 unpainted weathering steel connections.
 a. Direct Tension Indicator Tightening - Install new and unused direct tension indicator
 washers at each bolt. Install so that the direct tension indicator protrusions are in contact
 with a hardened washer.
 
 Bring the connection to a snug-tight condition. Snug-tight is defined as the condition when
 all plies of the connection are in firm contact and can be attained by applying the full effort of
 a worker on the end of a 12-inch long wrench to each bolt in the connection. Tighten all
 fasteners in the connection by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the
 connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously
 tightened fasteners. In some cases, proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than a
 single cycle of systematic partial tightening.
 
 852
 
 00930.40
 After attaining a snug-tight condition, tighten all fasteners in the connection by progressing
 systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges until all of the
 spaces between the direct tension indicator protrusions refuse entry to a 0.005 inch feeler
 gauge.
 b. Turn-of-Nut Tightening - During all turn-of-nut tightening, proceed systematically from
 the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges. Tighten all bolts until they are
 simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted. Snug tight is defined as
 the tightness that exists when all plies of the joint are in firm contact. This may be attained
 by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a worker using a 12 inch long
 wrench. Following this initial operation, further tighten all bolts in the connection by the
 amount of rotation specified in Table 00560-3 in Section 00560. During the tightening
 operation do not permit rotation of the part not turned by the wrench.
 (e) Bolt Inspection:
 (1) General - The Engineer will observe the installation and tightening of bolts to determine
 that the selected tightening procedure is properly used and that all bolts are tightened, and in
 the case of direct tension indicators that the correct indication of tension has been achieved.
 Bolts may reach tensions substantially above the value given in Table 00560-1, but this will not
 be cause for rejection.
 (2) Direct Tension Indicator Method - Provide the Engineer full opportunity to witness
 installation of bolted connections. The Engineer will periodically observe the installation and
 tightening operations to ensure that proper procedures are being adhered to.
 
 Upon completion of a bolted joint, the Engineer will determine that all bolts have been
 tightened. A minimum of 10 percent, but not less than two bolts in each joint, will be inspected.
 The joint will be accepted as properly tightened when all spaces between the direct tension
 indicator protrusions refuse entry to a 0.005 inch feeler gauge. If there are any spaces
 between the direct tension indicator protrusions that do not refuse entry to a 0.005 inch feeler
 gauge, re-inspect all bolts, retighten bolts in the joint as required, and resubmit the joint for
 inspection.
 (3) Turn-of-Nut Method - When all turn-of-nut tightening activities have been witnessed and
 are acceptable by the Inspector, no additional bolt tightening inspection is required. If
 turn-of-nut tightening has been performed without being witnessed by the Inspector, use the
 following inspection procedure:
 
 • In the presence of the Engineer, use an inspection wrench, which may be a calibrated
 torque wrench.
 • Place three bolts of the same grade, diameter and condition as those under inspection
 individually in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension. Use a hardened
 washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt.
 • Tighten each bolt specified in the paragraph above in the calibration device by any
 convenient means to an initial condition equal to 20 percent of the required tension, and
 then to a tension not less than 5 percent greater than specified for its size in
 Table 00560-1 in Section 00560. Tightening beyond the initial condition shall not
 produce greater nut rotation than 1.5 times that allowed in Table 00560-3 in
 Section 00560. Then apply the inspecting wrench to the tightened bolt and determine the
 torque necessary to turn the nut or head 5 degrees, approximately 1 inch at 12 inches
 radius, in the tightening direction. Take the average torque measured in the tests of
 three bolts as the job inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in the next
 paragraph.
 853
 
 00930.41
 • Test bolts that have been tightened in the Structure and are represented by the sample
 prescribed above with the inspecting wrench.
 Apply the job inspecting torque
 to 10 percent of the bolts, but not less than two bolts selected at random. If no nut or bolt
 head is turned by this application of the job inspecting torque, the connection will be
 accepted as properly tightened. If any nut or bolt head is turned by the application of the
 job inspecting torque, test all bolts in the connections. Retighten all bolts whose nut or
 head is turned by the job inspecting torque, and re-inspect. Retighten all of the bolts in
 the connection and then resubmit the connection for the specified inspection.
 00930.41 Adjustable Sign Mounts - The mount shall allow vertical adjustment for positioning the
 sign and shall rotate to plumb the sign. Use galvanized or stainless steel nuts, bolts and washers
 for fasteners.
 Measurement
 00930.80 Measurement - No measurement of quantities will be made for metal sign supports.
 
 Estimated quantities of structural steel will be listed in the Special Provisions. If field verified post
 lengths increase or decrease by more than 25 percent of the length specified, adjustments to the
 Contract lump sum amount will be made according to 00190.10(h).

 considered unexpected obstructions and shall be removed without additional compensation.
 Drilling tools lost during the course of removing unexpected drilled shaft obstructions will be paid
 according to 00195.20.
 (f) Clean Out - Clean out drilled shafts according to 00512.43(h).
 00963.45 Reinforcing Steel - Furnish and place reinforcing steel as shown and according to the
 following:
 (a) Placement - Do not place reinforcing steel in the shaft excavation until the Engineer has
 approved the final elevation of the bottom of the shaft.
 
 In each shaft, place reinforcing steel extending from 3 inches above the bottom of the shaft
 excavation to the elevation shown. The reinforcing cage may be supported on the bottom of the
 shaft excavation if approved. Support the reinforcing cage to prevent distortion or settlement
 during concrete placement. If concrete placement does not immediately follow cage placement,
 remove the reinforcing cage from the excavation and rectify the integrity of the excavation prior to
 reinstallation of the cage.
 (b) Bracing - Rigidly brace the reinforcing cage to retain its shape for lifting. Lift the cage in a
 manner that does not cause permanent racking or distortion. Show bracing and any extra
 reinforcing steel required for fabrication of the cage on the submitted shop drawings. Remove
 cross bracing during cage placement, unless otherwise approved.
 (c) Concrete Cover - Maintain the required concrete cover shown on the Plans by placing
 concentric spacer bars or other approved devices around the reinforcing cage. Provide details of
 the proposed centering method on the shop drawings submitted according to 00963.40.
 
 881
 
 00963.47
 00963.47 Concrete - Furnish and place concrete according to the following:
 (a) Concrete Placement - Place concrete immediately after completion of the shaft excavation
 and with the approval of the Engineer. Immediately prior to concrete placement ensure the shaft
 clean out requirements are met according to 00963.43(f).
 
 Place concrete according to 00540.48(a) and continuously until concrete at the top of the shaft is
 free of water, Soil, and debris, and uncontaminated concrete extends to the plan top-of-shaft
 elevation. Dispose of all contaminated concrete expelled from the top of the shaft in an approved
 manner. Remove waste concrete from the site. If a delay in concrete placement occur because
 of a delay in concrete delivery or other factors reduce the placement rate to maintain a flow of
 fresh concrete into the shaft excavation.
 Unless otherwise approved, allow a maximum of 60 minutes between concrete placements and
 use no concrete older than 90 minutes from batch time. In addition to the above, use procedures
 for concrete placement which ensure that the concrete within the shaft becomes a monolithic,
 homogeneous unit.
 Place concrete using hoses or pipes having watertight joints. For concrete placement by gravity
 tremie, use hose or pipe having an inside diameter not less than 8 inches. For placement by
 concrete pump, use hose with inside diameter not less than 4 inches. Provide an alternate
 delivery system that can be used in case of failure of the primary delivery system. Place concrete
 only against the bottom of the drilled shaft or into fresh concrete.
 If caving occurs during concrete placement, the shaft may be rejected.
 (b) Wet Shaft Concrete Placement - Perform wet shaft concrete placement according
 to 00512.47(c).
 (c) Concrete Curing and Cleaning - Allow the exposed top of concrete to cure a minimum
 of 7 days by covering with wet burlap overlain with plastic sheets or by keeping top of concrete
 under water. Keep the burlap wet during the concrete cure.
 
 Prior to placing any fresh concrete on top of a completed shaft, clean the upper surface of the
 concrete by removing all scum, laitance, loose gravel and sediment and chip off any high spots
 on the upper surface that would prevent the steel reinforcing bar cage from being properly placed
 in the position shown on the Plans.
 (d) Casing Removal - Remove all temporary casing during or after completion of concrete
 placement. Do not start temporary casing removal until the level of fresh concrete within the
 casing has reached a depth of 10 feet or the level necessary to adequately counteract the
 external hydrostatic pressure head. As the temporary casing is withdrawn, maintain a minimum
 5 feet head of concrete above the bottom of the casing. A slight downward movement of the
 casing while exerting downward pressure, or hammering or vibrating the casing will be allowed to
 facilitate extraction. Extract the casing so that concrete is cast directly against the surrounding
 in-situ material. Check the elevation of the top of the reinforcing cage before and after temporary
 casing extraction for conformance with the construction tolerance criteria of 00963.42. Casing
 that cannot be extracted during or immediately after the concrete placement operation may be
 cause for rejection of the shaft.
 00963.48 Drilled Shaft Testing and Acceptance - Acceptance of drilled shafts will be based on
 the Engineer's review of the field inspection reports and visual observations during drilled shaft
 construction. The Engineer has final authority on the approval of drilled shafts.
 
 882
 
 00963.90
 00963.49 Scheduling and Restrictions - Do not proceed with additional shafts until the first drilled
 shaft has been approved. After the first drilled shaft on the Project has been accepted, make no
 significant change in construction methods, Equipment or materials used in the construction of
 subsequent shafts, unless approved by the Engineer.
 
 For 24 hours after completion of concrete placement in a newly-constructed shaft, including
 withdrawal of casing if applicable, do not, within 15 feet of the shaft:
 • Excavate adjacent shafts
 • Construct footings
 • Apply Equipment wheel loads
 • Introduce vibrations with a velocity greater than 1/4 inch per second
 Measurement
 00963.80 Measurement - The quantities of signal support drilled shafts will be measured on the
 length basis, by the vertical excavated length from the bottom of the shaft to the ground surface. If
 directed to construct drilled shafts below the elevations shown, the drilled shaft will be measured
 from the revised bottom of shaft.

 install traffic signals according to the following Specifications.
 Materials
 00990.10 Backer Rod and Loop Sealant - Furnish backer rod Material and hot-melt loop sealant
 from the QPL.
 Construction
 00990.40 Cable and Wire:
 (a) General - Install wire and cable according to 00960.45 and the following:
 
 Install wire and cable between terminal blocks without splicing, except for loop wire to loop feeder
 cable.
 Leave slack in each wire and cable at each junction box, pole, and controller cabinet as follows:
 • 2 feet in junction boxes and poles
 • 6 feet in controller cabinets
 • 6 feet in the first junction box nearest the controller
 In mast arm poles, use control cable from the pole terminal cabinet to vehicle signal heads and
 signs. Run a separate No. 14 AWG cable as required for each signal head. If existing cables or
 equipment are damaged by the Contractor's operations, immediately notify the Engineer and the
 affected owner.
 Tape the ends of unused conductors with insulating vinyl plastic tape.
 (b) Control Cable Attachment - Use self-locking cable ties to attach cables to the messenger
 cable. Tighten to remove gaps between the control cable and the messenger cable. After
 tightening, trim all excess material.
 (c) Messenger Cable - Install the eyebolts through the entire pole. Pull the shoulder of the eye
 tight against the front face of the pole.
 (d) Tether and Stabilizer Cable - Tighten cables to limit signal and sign movement. Install
 Agency furnished S-hooks between the eyebolt and turnbuckle.
 (e) Interconnect Cable:
 (1) Labels - Label all interconnect cable with approved bronze or plastic labels, permanently
 and ruggedly attached. The labels shall be embossed with the cable identification number if
 shown. Additionally, labels used on Utility facilities shall bear the legend "TRAFFIC SIGNAL".
 Label all ends of cables. Label all overhead cable in each direction away from the point of
 attachment, 2 feet from Utility poles. Do not install labels until the Engineer approves the
 labels and attachment mechanism. Label all cables in the interconnect terminal cabinets and
 at terminal panel locations.
 
 889
 
 00990.41
 (2) Installation - Use approved cable guides, feeders, shoes and bushings to prevent
 damage to the cable during installation. Do not pull cable over edges or corners, over or
 around obstructions or through unnecessary curves or bends.
 
 Cable in trunk runs may be installed by hand or by mechanical methods, as approved. Trunk
 runs are those lengths of conduit that will have 25 or more pairs of interconnect cable installed.
 Install all other cable by hand methods only.
 Before installing cable, provide the Engineer with one copy of the cable manufacturer's
 recommended and maximum pulling tensions for each cable type.
 When installing cable using a pulling eye, do not exceed the cable manufacturer's maximum
 recommended pulling tension for pulling from the pulling eye. When installing cable using a
 pulling sock over the outer jacket, do not exceed the cable manufacturer's maximum
 recommended pulling tension for pulling by the outer jacket, or 80 percent of the
 manufacturer's maximum recommended pulling tension for pulling by a pulling eye, whichever
 is smaller. Use an approved dynamometer to ensure that the maximum allowable pulling
 tension is not exceeded during installation.
 (3) Aerial Cable - Use terminal cabinets for aerial pole entrance of interconnect cable.
 
 Match the sag as closely as possible with wires already on poles to minimize movement in
 windstorms and conflict with adjacent wires.
 Use a cable grip on the jacketed messenger when pulling and tensioning. Pull and tension
 cable without damaging the jacket. When separating the messenger on figure-8 cable from
 the jacketed conductor assembly for dead-ending or splicing, split the web using approved
 tools designed for this task.
 At corners and run ends, dead-end the messenger strand with approved automatic dead end
 connectors. Cut the strand and remove the jacket, exposing enough strand so that the ends of
 the strands coming through the chucks of both vises can be overlapped and bonded together
 to form a continuous ground. Use a one-bolt guy clamp to bond the strand ends together.
 Remove unused strand.
 (4) Underground - In transition areas from overhead to underground, continue the aerial
 cable underground to the nearest termination panel. If figure-8 type cable is used for overhead
 locations, strip the messenger wire from the cable, using approved tools, where the cable is
 within a conduit, pole or cabinet.
 
 Pull the necessary length of cable to be installed from pull point to pull point skipping any
 intermediate junction box, handhole, or other opening in underground system. Carefully store
 the remaining length of cable to be installed in the next conduit in a manner that is not
 hazardous to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, and protects the cable from damage. Obtain the
 Engineer's approval of the storage methods to be used.

 which it is intended.
 (b) Inductive Loop Detectors:
 (1) Saw Cut - Make cuts compatible with construction and in the most practicable, direct line
 between loops and junction boxes, except where parallel to, or nearly parallel to, a lane line;
 then locate cuts under the lane lines.
 
 Make saw cuts 1/2 inch wide for loop wire.
 Saw cuts shall have smooth bottoms, with no edges due to differences in cut depth.
 Limit saw cut angles to 90 degrees or less to limit the bend in loop wire. Cuts shall not create
 islands of Pavement less than 2.5 square feet in area.
 Flush cuts thoroughly with a high-pressure water stream immediately after sawing, and before
 the cuttings dry. Blow cuts free of water, debris, Rock, and grit with high-volume or
 high-pressure air.
 Slots may also be cleaned by means of a high-pressure water
 injection/vacuum extraction system. Remove all cuttings from the Project.
 Dry cuts before placing wire. Remove rocks or other material that may be wedged in the cut.
 Two sets of twisted pair loop wires may be installed in a single saw cut, as long as the
 minimum cover shown is provided and adequate Pavement depth is available. The Engineer
 may limit the allowable saw cut depth and width to avoid damage to the Pavement.
 
 892
 
 00990.43
 On new open-graded AC wearing Courses install loops in the Base Lift, or in the Existing
 Surfacing if it is to be overlaid, and after milling has been completed.
 In an existing open-graded AC surface, the saw cut and installation shall be as shown.
 (2) Wire - Place a permanent plastic label on each loop feeder cable indicating the loop
 numbers as shown on the Loop Detector Wiring Diagram. Place labels within 4 inches of the
 end of the jacket at each end of the loop feeder cables. Remove all existing labels that do not
 match the Loop Detector Wiring Diagram.
 
 Do not remove the outside jacket and shield of loop feeder cables more than 6 inches from the
 end, inside the controller cabinet. Solder all loop feeder conductor terminations from field
 wiring in signal controller cabinets after crimp lugs have been installed. Crimp lugs used for
 loop wire field terminals may be insulated or non-insulated. Terminate loop feeder shield drain
 wire to the cabinet input panel grounding bus nearest the feeder wire termination points.
 (3) Installation - The Engineer will mark or approve the center point location of all loops to be
 installed. Do not place wire in saw cuts until the cuts have been inspected by the Engineer.
 
 After the saw cut is cleaned of debris, place the loop wire by pushing it into the slot with a
 blunt, nonmetallic object. Use care to avoid damaging the insulation.
 Use one continuous, unbroken length of loop wire to form a loop of the number of turns
 required and to reach the loop feeder cable splice point shown or specified. Twist the loop
 wire pair together 4 to 6 twists for each foot from the exit point of the loop to the splice point of
 the loop feeder cable or termination point in the controller cabinet as shown. Use one
 continuous, unbroken length of loop feeder cable from the loop wire splice point to the cabinet.
 After loop wire is placed and before the saw slot is sealed, install loop wire hold-downs (backer
 rods) made of closed-cell polyurethane. Place 1 inch lengths of the hold-down material along
 the loop perimeter and all other saw slots containing loop wire 6 inches from loop corners and
 at maximum 12 inch centers. Hold-downs shall fit snugly in saw slots.
 Install the sealant in slots according to the manufacturer's instructions. Furnish a copy of the
 manufacturer's specifications including application procedures. The Engineer may order a test
 run of any application method or material before filling saw cuts.
 Sealant shall not protrude above the Pavement, nor be more than 1/8 inch below the
 Pavement level after curing. Where cuts are made on a slope and sealant runs or puddles,
 start at the low end, pour the sealant, and hold it in place with 2 inch duct tape placed on the
 roadway surface over the cut. If duct tape or other device is used to contain the sealant in the
 saw cut, remove it on the same Day, after the sealant is fully cured.
 In order to prevent heat damage to the insulation, do not allow the temperature of the sealant

 Native Plant (existing) - A variety of plant species occurring in its natural habitat without direct or
 indirect human actions.
 Noxious Weed - All weed designated by the Oregon State Weed Board as injurious to public
 health, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, or all public or private property. The Oregon Department of
 Agriculture (ODA) will be the authority in determination of noxious weed species.
 Pure Live Seed (PLS) - The amount of living seed in the total quantity of seed when non-viable
 seed or non-seed material is excluded.
 Riparian - Related to the bank, shore, or water-influenced areas of a watercourse or water body.
 Sensitive Areas - Defined areas such as Wetlands, natural water and riparian resources, special
 environmental zones, or where certain activities are restricted such as the use of chemicals.
 Specified Weeds - All noxious weeds as defined above, and all plant species identified in the
 Special Provisions or on the Plans as a species to be removed.
 Waters of the State - See ORS 468B.005 for "Waters of the State" definition.
 Weed - A plant that is undesirable where it is growing.
 Weed Free - For these Specifications, "Weed Free" is defined as the following maximum amount of
 living weeds per square yard:
 
 • Zero "Type A" or "Type T" Noxious Weeds
 • One "Type B" Noxious Weed

 01030.13 Seed - Furnish seed meeting the following requirements:
 (a) Label - Deliver all seed in standard, sealed containers.
 following:
 
 Label each container with the
 
 • The kind and variety of each seed of 3 percent or more in a mixture, by weight. Be sure that
 seed mix labels include the words "mixture" or "mixed seed" when the seed is a mixture
 • The country or state where the seed is grown
 • The lot number or other lot identification
 • The total percentage, by weight, of other crop seed
 • The total percentage, by weight, of weed seed
 • The total percentage, by weight, of inert matter
 • Statement of "No Noxious (weed) Found"

 (b) Quality - Furnish seed meeting the following requirements:
 
 900
 
 01030.13
 • The seed and labeling complies with Oregon Seed Law and Federal Seed Act.
 • The seed has been tested within 18 months of the planting date.
 • The seed is not sprouted, moldy, or showing evidence of having been wet or otherwise
 damaged.
 • The seed is labeled as "Oregon Certified Seed" or the equivalent from another state when
 identified in the Special Provisions. Information about certified seed is available from
 County Extension Offices, Oregon State University, and the Oregon Department of
 Agriculture.
 (c) Pure Live Seed - Obtain the amount of seed to apply by using the purity and germination
 percentages from the label on actual bags of seed to be used on the Project.
 
 To calculate the amount of seed to be applied:
 • Obtain the PLS factor - Multiply the seed label germination percentage times the seed label
 purity percentage.
 • Divide the specified PLS rate by the PLS factor.
 Example: A PLS seeding rate of 10 pounds per acre is specified. The seed label shows a purity
 of 80 percent and germination is 90 percent. After converting percentages to decimals,
 0.80 x 0.90 equals a factor of 0.72. The specified PLS rate, 10 pounds per acre, divided by the
 factor of 0.72 equals 13.88. In order to meet a PLS seeding rate of 10 pounds per acre, about
 14 pounds of seed needs to be applied per acre. For a seed mix, make this calculation for every
 seed to obtain the total amount to be applied.
 (d) Inspection - Each lot of seed is subject to inspection upon delivery to the Project. Seed that
 is not labeled or that does not conform to the Specifications will be rejected and shall be replaced
 at no additional cost to the Agency.
 (e) Mixes - Furnish seed mixes that meet the labeling, quality and inspection requirements
 stated above. Submit all other proposed seed or seed mixes for consideration and receive

 • The Engineer will be the authority in the determination of Sensitive Areas.
 (d) Weed Control Corrective Work - If corrective Work for areas identified as deficient by the
 Engineer is not completed within a 15 Calendar Day period, the Engineer may suspend the Work
 according to 00180.70. If the Contractor's weed control Work is determined to be unsatisfactory,
 the Agency reserves the right to do the Work at the Contractor's expense.
 01030.43 Temporary and Permanent Seeding:
 (a) Temporary Seeding - Temporarily seed disturbed Soils and slopes that are not at finished
 grade and which will be exposed for 2 months or longer before being disturbed again. Provide
 fertilizer, mulch, water, and other amendments necessary to ensure establishment. Ensure that
 temporary seeding Work achieves the coverage of live plants required by 01030.60 by the end of
 the next permanent seeding date stated in 01030.43(b). If this coverage is not achieved, or if the
 Agency determines that it is not effective in stabilizing the Soil from erosion, stabilize the area
 with other temporary stabilization methods as described in 00280.42 at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 (b) Permanent Seeding - Perform this seeding during the permanent seeding dates shown

 hydromulch fiber to the seed and fertilizer mixture to visibly aid uniform application at no
 additional cost to the Agency.
 (2) Dry Mulch:
 a. Straw Mulch - Evenly apply straw mulch within 24 hours after seeding and fertilizing. In
 areas not accessible to heavy Equipment or hose, apply straw mulch by hand or other
 approved method.
 
 Place straw mulch approximately 2 inches deep, in loose condition, which requires
 approximately 2 1/2 tons per acre of dry mulch, depending on moisture content. Do not
 use straw mulch on Slopes of 1V:1.5H or steeper.
 b. Compost Material Mulch - Evenly apply compost material mulch with a pneumatic
 blower or other Equipment that propels the material directly at the Soil surface and achieves
 direct contact with the Soil. Apply compost at a uniform depth of 2 inches. Apply at least
 3 feet over the top of the slope or overlap the material into existing vegetation.

 Soil forming a uniform surface cover effective at preventing erosion by one of the following:
 1. Crimping Disc - A heavy disk with flat scalloped discs approximately 1/4 inch thick,
 having dull edges and spaced no more than 9 inches apart.
 2. Sheep's-Foot Roller - Modified sheep's foot roller equipped with straight studs, made
 of approximately 3/4 inch steel plate, placed approximately 8 inches apart and staggered.
 Ensure that the studs are not less than 6 inches long or more than 6 inches wide, and are
 rounded to prevent withdrawing the straw from the Soil. Use a roller with enough weight
 to incorporate the straw sufficiently into the Soil providing a uniform surface cover.
 (c) Drill Seeder - Apply seed and fertilizer with a grass seed drill that works fertilizer into the Soil
 and places seed under about a 1/4 inch Soil cover.
 (d) Seeding Over Mulched Areas - If an area has been previously mulched for erosion control
 or temporary seed and mulch is present on the Soil surface, double the amount of each seed type
 used. Apply seed and fertilizer hydraulically and add a green dye to the mixture to visibly aid
 uniform application. Upon approval, fertilizer and seed may only be applied after mulching if one
 of the following conditions apply:
 
 • Mulch is punched into the Soil by mechanized means.
 • It is necessary to hold down mulch with netting or like material.
 • The Slope is 1V:1.5H or steeper and a slurry mixture would tend to run down the slope.

 Prepare planting areas according to the following methods, or as otherwise specified:
 (a) Method "A" (Cultivated Planting Areas, Non-lawn) - Cultivate plant beds to a depth
 of 12 inches. Thoroughly mix 2 inches of Soil conditioners into the top 12 inches of plant beds.
 In addition, add Soil amendments, Soil bio-amendments and fertilizers, as shown or specified,
 according to the Soil amendment and Soil bio-amendment reports recommendations, into the top
 12 inches of Topsoil.
 
 Finish grades by raking to a grade tolerance of plus or minus 1 inch, with a smooth and firm
 condition, and an even grade that is free of undulations or low areas that could create standing
 water. Match existing grades at the perimeter. Finish to the proposed grades shown or specified.
 On slopes that the Agency determines are too steep to cultivate, plants may be planted in
 individual planting holes prepared using method "B".
 (b) Method "B" (Non-Cultivated Planting Areas) - Spray existing weeds and non-desirable
 vegetation with herbicide to kill all top growth and roots in areas not requiring cultivation. Use
 herbicides that have limited residual toxicity to permit safe planting as required under the
 Contract. Do not spray or otherwise harm plants to be saved. After inspection and approval,
 remove the dead top growth of plant material within 2 inches of the surface and dispose of
 according to Section 00320. Replace plants to be saved that are damaged by herbicide
 application at no additional cost to the Agency.
 
 Add any Soil conditioners, Soil amendments, Soil bio-amendments or fertilizers with the backfill at
 each plant pit or to the seeding operation.
 927
 
 01040.49
 Finish Wetland mitigation planting areas to specified finish elevations, blending to existing ground
 smoothly, as required and directed. Except for projects that are less than 1 year in duration and
 unless otherwise approved, review the seasonal hydrology of the area to be planted for one full
 winter season (November 15 to February 28) prior to planting any wetland plants. Adjust plant
 types and planting locations as required or directed, based on the review of site hydrology.
 When planting seedling plants, completely scalp vegetation from a 12 inch diameter area around
 each planting hole. Clear all debris such as wood and rocks from the planting spots, provided
 debris is not deeper than 12 inches. When debris is deeper, move the planting location. Use
 herbicides around seedlings only upon written approval of the Agency.
 (c) Method "C" (Sod Lawn and Seeded Lawn Areas) - Cultivate existing ground to a depth
 of 6 inches, achieving a loose and friable condition suitable for fine grading. Remove all
 vegetation, rocks larger than 2 inch diameter, clods, roots, sticks, debris, and other matter
 detrimental to the growth of sod.

 Fine grade and roll planting areas with a water-filled roller to provide a fine-textured, smooth, firm
 surface, free of undulations, irregularities or low areas that could create standing water. Grade
 areas receiving sod to within 1/2 inch of the designed grades, and 1 inch below adjacent walks,
 curbs and Pavement. Since sod thickness varies, adjust initial grades so the final sod Soil level is
 slightly below adjacent hard surface grades. Ensure that final sod grade does not create a
 pedestrian tripping hazard.
 Furnish the Agency with sod mixture information and a quality compliance certificate from the sod
 grower, certifying sod compliance with mixture requirements, according to 01040.10.
 Prior to completion of any sodding and seeding, re-grade ruts, footprints, washouts, or any other
 irregularities, and re-seed or re-sod repaired areas as originally specified.
 (d) Method "D" (Rough Areas Seeded for Revegetation or Erosion Control) - Remove any
 matter detrimental or toxic to the growth of plants, including weeds, clods, rocks or debris. On
 Slopes 1V:3H or flatter, remove all debris larger than 2 inches in any dimension. On cut Slopes
 1V:1.5H or flatter, roughen the surface with furrows parallel with slope contours and loosen the
 Soil to a depth between 3 inches and 6 inches.
 (e) Method "E" (Temporary Seeding Areas) - If grading is required or directed, make
 Equipment Passes at right angles to the slope in order to form seed-holding tracks in the Soil.
 01040.49 General Planting - Plant trees, shrubs, groundcover, vines, and bulbs using the following
 practices:
 
 • Inspect plants after arrival at the Project and before planting. Do not install plant materials until
 each required inspection by the Agency is complete. Replace plants not meeting the
 requirements of the Specifications with plants as specified or otherwise directed, at no
 928
 
 01040.49
 additional cost to the Agency. Initial approval of plant materials for planting by the Agency will
 not constitute final acceptance.
 • Protect all plants during shipping, handling, storage, and planting from windburn or exposure to
 harmful weather conditions, and root or root ball drying.
 • When excavating planting holes, stockpile excavated Topsoil separately from subsoil. Do not
 include alkali Soil, subsoil, gravel, debris or rocks in the Topsoil. Dispose of any substandard
 excavated materials in a manner not harmful to plants or planting Work. Scarify planting pit
 sides and bottoms to eliminate glazed surfaces. Dispose of excess Soil in a manner that is not
 harmful to plants or planting Work.
 • Do not plant in standing water unless approved by the Agency. If standing water is present
 within a plant pit, notify the Agency prior to planting to determine what corrective measures are
 required.
 • Excavate tree plant pits a minimum of twice the diameter of the plant root ball or 2 feet larger
 than the root ball, whichever is greater. Dig shrub plant pits a minimum of 1 foot larger than
 the root ball diameter. Dig pits to the same depth as the root ball, root mass, or container.
 Spread root systems of bare root plants and container stock as necessary to keep plants from
 being root bound.
 • Cleanly cut off broken or frayed roots of bare-root plants before planting. Spread out roots in
 their natural position within the pit and trim only damaged roots as approved by the Agency.
 Remove all labels, tags and attachment materials from the plants before final inspection.
 • Set upright growing plants straight and plumb, and prostrate growing plants level to the ground
 surface. Set all plants so that, after settlement, they are at the same level as when growing in
 the nursery or container.
 • Place the backfill then add Soil amendments, Soil bio-amendments, and fertilizers as
 recommended by the Soil amendment and bio-amendment reports.
 Moisten backfill
 completely after placing to eliminate air pockets and minimize settlement of the backfill. Form
 a shallow (2 inch high) water-holding saucer in the Soil around the plant unless directed
 otherwise.
 • Balled and burlapped plants may be placed with the root ball wrapping removed or, if all
 materials are untreated and fully biodegradable, left in place. If the root ball wrapping (burlap)
 is left around the plant, completely remove all tie wire, string or twine and fold down the burlap
 from the top half of the root ball.
 • Perform any required pruning using good horticultural practice appropriate to the type of plant.
 Prune to remove all dead, damaged, crossed or rubbing twigs and branches, and to
 compensate for loss of roots during planting. Make cuts close to the parent stem, but not flush
 or through the bark "knob" at the branch joint. Do not prune terminal ends of tree leaders
 without approval of the Agency.
 • Apply bark or wood chip mulch of the type and depth as shown. Correct contamination of new
 mulch due to the Contractor's operations at no additional cost to the Agency. Feather mulch
 into plant material trunks, stems, canes or root collars, and leave 1 inch below the top of
 junction and valve boxes, curbs and Pavement edges. Any mulch placed to a thickness
 greater than specified will be at no additional cost to the Agency.
 • Do not disturb protected existing vegetation unless approved by the Agency prior to
 construction.
 • Dig pits for street trees that have hard surfaces around them so the crown of the root ball
 is 3 inches below the finished surface of the surrounding grade.
 • Water deciduous trees that are 1 1/2 inches or larger in diameter, conifer trees that are over
 4 feet in height, and all shrubs at a minimum frequency identified in the Special Provisions.

 01040.50 Special Planting Requirements:
 (a) Transplanted Specimen Plants - Use the following methods for transplanting specimen
 plants, unless otherwise specified:
 (1) Mechanical Digging - Use a tree spade unless otherwise directed. Move only during the
 season that the tree is dormant. Treat deciduous plants with anti-transpirant prior to
 excavation. Confirm with the Agency that the size of the spade is appropriate to the size and
 type of tree prior to beginning Work. Dig the receiving hole prior to digging the tree to be
 transplanted. Take care not to damage the tree bark. Refill the original hole after
 transplanting. Do not move Oregon White Oak (Quercus garryana) by this method.
 (2) Hand Digging - Before digging, obtain approval from the Agency for the size of container
 or root ball to be used for each plant. Begin digging at a diameter greater than the expected
 size of the root ball and remove dirt toward the plant until the surface roots show. When
 completely dug, secure the root ball with burlap and twine, wire basket or in a wooden box.
 Take special care to dig deep enough so that the taproot is not cut until it is smaller than
 3/8 inch. Take care not to damage the tree bark. Refill the original hole and compact the Soil
 after transplanting.
 
 Install perforated plastic drainpipe as shown. Add fertilizer, Soil amendments or bioamendments to backfill Topsoil mixture. Stake or guy the tree as specified.
 Provide one application of anti-transpirant before transplanting, and one application of
 Vitamin B1 growth hormone after planting to each specimen plant according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 Perform all replanting of specimen plants according to 01040.41 and 01040.42.
 (b) Staking and Guying Trees - Stake and guy planted trees as shown or directed.
 (c) Seedling Trees - Plant seedling trees using one of the following three methods:
 
 • Planting hoe capable of opening a vertical hole broken out on three sides, with a minimum
 blade length of 12 inches and width of 3 inches.
 • Planting shovel capable of opening a vertical hole broken out on three sides and at least
 10 inches deep.
 • Normal bare-root planting method.
 No pre-staking of planting locations will be required. The Agency will be present as planting
 begins and will approve the spacing, planting method, and areas to be planted before Work can
 begin. Vary plant spacing in order to allow seedlings to be planted in suitable Soil. During the
 planting process, remove one tree at a time from the planting bag or other container to prevent
 drying of roots.
 Place the roots of each seedling in the ground so that they assume a natural arrangement and do
 not twist, angle, bunch together or turn up at the ends. Plant seedlings so that the root collar is at
 or above the ground plane by no more than 1/2 inch. During planting, tamp Soil around the roots
 in the lower half of the hole. Then fill the hole to the surrounding Soil level and firmly pack so that
 no air pockets remain around the roots.
 Ensure that seedlings do not pull loose with a tug strong enough to detach a small group of
 needles or small branch ends as applicable. Place a stake at the edge of each planting pit and
 install browsing protection and browsing repellant.
 930
 
 01040.53
 (d) Tubeling Plants - Place the tubeling into the planting pit without breaking the root mass. Set
 the top of the root collar 1/2 inch above finish grade, and gently tamp Soil around the plant to
 compact the backfill. Place a stake at the edge of the plant pit and attach a browsing protector
 around each plant.
 (e) Collected Plants - After plants become dormant, excavate collected plants by hand,
 protecting the root mass against drying, freezing or breaking. If possible, plant all collected stock
 the same Day as gathered, or transport to a local nursery for temporary storage until final
 planting.
 
 If immediate planting is not possible, place collected plants in heavy paper or plastic with slightly
 damp Peat moss or sterile potting Soil. Store dormant plants at 32 F to 37 F until planting.
 Examine stored material frequently for signs of stress or disease and correct storage conditions
 as necessary. Plant collected plants before dormant bud development.
 (f) Bulbs - Plant dormant bulbs at a depth of 1 inch to 2 inches or to the grade they grew
 naturally. Compact the Soil firmly around the bulbs to prevent float-out and ensure good
 establishment. Dig holes large enough to naturally space bulbs within the planting area.
 (g) Plant Cuttings - Collect and plant the cuttings while in winter dormancy, generally between
 October and March. Notify the Agency if conflicts exist with permit requirements. Store all cut
 material in ventilated plastic containers that allow free flow of water. Protect root systems from
 excessive drying at all times. Do not store plants in airtight containers.
 
 Plant stock within 4 hours of harvest. If plants are a willow species, plant in the riparian zone on
 that portion of the slope where the plant stem ends will be in contact with year-round moist Soil as
 determined by the Agency. Make planting holes by forcing a steel bar or similar tool into the
 ground about 12 inches deep. Place the cuttings into the holes and tamp Soil firmly around the
 stems, leaving a minimum of 6 inches showing. Vary these dimensions as required for larger
 plant cuttings.
 01040.51 Planting Wetland Plants - When planting wetland plants, do not use Soil amendments,
 mulch, or fertilizer. Plant rhizomes, tubers and plugs within the upper 2 inches to 3 inches in
 exposed muddy or moist Soils. When the water depth reaches or exceeds 1 inch notify the Agency
 of the potential need for adjustment to the planting.
 01040.52 Placing Sod Lawn - Place sod only after approval of the Agency. Immediately before
 placing sod, water the Soil bed to prevent drying of grass roots. Lay the first sod row in a straight
 line, then place subsequent rows parallel to and tightly against each other, staggering lateral joints.
 Do not stretch or overlap the sod. Tightly butt all joints. Do not use sod segments containing less
 than 2 square feet of surface area.
 
 After placement, diagonally roll and thoroughly water the sod. Apply a second application
 of 22-16-8 fertilizer at the rate of 510 pounds per 100 square yards and thoroughly water.
 01040.53 Mulch - Apply mulch according to the following:
 (a) Ornamental Plant Bed Areas - Submit a 15 pound sample of bark mulch to the Agency for
 visual inspection and approval. The approved sample will be the standard of acceptability for all
 mulch used on the Project.
 
 Apply bark mulch after beds are made free of weeds and debris, the surface is brought to a
 smooth finished grade, and all planting Work (except for vines and groundcovers) is complete.
 Uniformly bark mulch planted areas to a nominal depth of 2 inches with bark mulch. Apply bark
 931
 
 01040.54
 mulch so that it presents a smooth and even appearance as approved by the Agency (raking may
 be required).
 Keep bark mulch off plants, Structures, Roadways, Shoulders, walks, and lawns. Uncover all
 plants covered by mulch material as soon as possible and leave the site in a neat, clean and
 finished appearance. When planting vines or groundcover, rake bark mulch away from planting
 pits so that the bark is not contaminated. After planting, evenly spread excess Soil and rake bark
 mulch back into place.
 Replace bark mulch that is displaced or blown away, and correct to the specified depth any bark
 mulch placed to a greater than specified depth, at no additional cost to the Agency.
 Spread Rock or cinder mulch to a depth of 2 inches after planting trees and shrubs.
 Spread compost on top of the Soil to a nominal depth of 3 inches.
 (b) Non-Ornamental Plant Bed Areas - Apply mulch according to one of the following methods:
 (1) Straw Mulch - Spread grass straw mulch to a nominal 2 inch depth and tackify, after
 planting of tubeling plants and seeding as required.
 (2) Wood Chips - Spread wood chips to a nominal depth of 2 inches. Add 15 pounds of
 Ammonium Nitrate per 1,000 square feet to neutralize nitrogen loss.
 (3) Compost Blanket - Spread compost on top of the Soil to a nominal depth of 3 inches.
 01040.54 Water - Water all plants at intervals as required to maintain and promote healthy growth.
 Avoid excessive watering of shrub bed areas that may leach herbicide and damage adjacent lawns
 or desirable or protected vegetation. Repair all lawn vegetation damage at no additional cost to the
 Agency.
 (a) Pressure Moisture Stress Sensor - When a pressure moisture stress sensor is specified,
 the Agency will test a 1 to 5 percent representative sample to ensure that the moisture stress
 level is below 20 bars of pressure and inform the Contractor if any material exceeds this limit.
 Any plant material found to have greater than 25 bars of pressure will be considered to be under
 extreme moisture stress. Provide sufficient water within 24 hours to bring the plant into normal
 range. The Agency will retest to determine the new representative pressure. Plant material that
 have 30 bars or greater will be considered to have reached its permanent wilting point. Replace
 all such material during the next planting period. Testing will occur mid-day at the following times
 until the end of the Establishment Periods:
 
 • After plant delivery, during temporary storage, and before planting.
 • At 1 month intervals throughout the summer season, up to the first fall rain or snow.
 • At weekly intervals during extremely hot or dry summer periods.
 • Any time the Agency believes the plant material may be under stress.
 (b) Moisture Retention Chemicals - Utilize moisture retention chemicals according to the
 manufacturer's recommendation, depending upon specific applications.
 01040.55 Miscellaneous Items - Place or install miscellaneous items as follows:
 (a) Boulders - Place Boulders in locations as shown. Do not scar or break Boulders with

 all Rock placement with the Agency prior to installation.
 
 932
 
 01040.70
 (b) Tree Grates - Install grates, frames, and appurtenances as shown and according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations. Place frames flush at sidewalks and place guards plumb
 according to the manufactures recommendations.
 (c) Weed Control Geotextile - Place weed control geotextile at finish Soil grade when planting
 is complete but before mulch placement begins. Place weed control geotextile with a minimum
 4 inch overlap between rolls, turned under edges, and attached to the ground as recommended
 by the manufacturer.
 (d) Woody Coarse Debris - Place woody coarse debris within the stream channel, facing
 upstream at approximately 45 degrees from the stream bank, or as shown or as directed. Anchor
 woody coarse debris to the stream channel bottom as shown.
 (e) Anti-transpirant - Apply anti-transpirant according to the manufacturer's directions to all
 exposed foliage surfaces immediately before materials are delivered to the Project, or as
 otherwise specified. Provide certification of compliance.
 (f) Game Repellent - Apply a game repellent to all exposed foliage surfaces immediately after
 materials are planted, or as otherwise specified. Re-apply to each plant every 120 days, or
 according to the manufacturer's printed instructions, until the end of the plant Establishment
 Period.
 (g) Browsing Protectors - Install browsing protectors according to the manufacturer's
 recommendations.
 (h) Root Barrier - Install root barrier according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

 finish ground and the first whorl of tree branches.
 01040.56 Cleanup During Construction - Maintain the Project in a neat, orderly condition.
 Remove unsightly construction materials at the end of each working shift. Clean all Pavement
 surfaces of mud, debris, or other materials that may, in the opinion of the Agency, cause problems.
 If material is not removed, the Agency reserves the right to have the cleanup Work performed and
 deduct the value of this Work from the monies otherwise due the Contractor.
 Plant Establishment
 01040.70 General - The Contractor is responsible for the survival of all plant material until the end
 of a plant Establishment Period of 1 calendar year. The plant Establishment Period will begin when
 all the original planting is complete. The original planting is considered complete when all the plant
 material has been planted to the satisfaction of the Agency.
 
 Establishment Period Work includes removing all plants that have reached their permanent wilting
 point, are dead, dying, or which do not meet Specifications, and replacing them with healthy plants.
 All plants in place after this replacement will be recognized as the original planting and will be
 subject to the establishment Specifications. Repair, restore, and replace all plantings that have
 been damaged by vehicles, vandalized, and stolen according to 00170.80.
 
 933
 
 01040.71
 01040.71 Plant Care and Success Criteria - During the plant Establishment Period, maintain
 plants in a vigorous growing condition by regularly doing the following:
 
 • Watering and fertilizing sufficiently to promote growth.
 • Weeding, cultivating, pruning, and repairing.
 • Adjusting tree stakes and guys.
 • Controlling weeds before they seed according to 01040.48.
 • Controlling pests and noxious weeds before the reproductive cycle.
 • Removing dead or non-vigorous plants.
 • Replacing missing plants.
 • Re-mulching of plant bed areas.
 The determination of a successful plant Establishment Period will be made at periodic plant
 establishment inspections. A successful planting establishment for each inspection is defined as
 follows:
 • All plants are surviving and have vigorous growth.
 • Plants are free of insects and disease.
 • Plants show signs of continuing health.
 • Plants have not reached permanent wilting point.
 At the discretion of the Agency, certain types of regularly spaced plantings such as groundcovers
 may be measured using an area sampling method. To determine the rate of survival, set out
 (delineate) representative plots measuring 100 square feet at the completion of the original planting
 at random locations in each general planting area. The representative plots will be mutually agreed
 upon between the Contractor and the Agency. Mark the plot corners with permanent markers such
 as re-bar, including date and identification. Delineate a minimum of three plots per acre of new
 planting area.
 The use of representative plots is intended to simplify the measurement of planting establishment
 Work. If Work within the representative plots does not accurately reflect the condition of the entire
 planting areas, the Agency reserves the right to reject all establishment Work.
 01040.72 Periodic Inspections - During the plant Establishment Period, the Agency will make
 three plant establishment inspections jointly with the Contractor at the following times:
 
 • Spring, early May
 • Summer, mid-July
 • Fall, late September
 Depending on when the Establishment Period begins, one of the above inspections will be the final
 inspection.
 During each plant establishment inspection, the Agency may determine, based upon the specified
 success criteria, that corrective Work is required. If so, the Agency will provide the Contractor with a
 written notice of required corrective Work sent by hand-delivery or mail.
 01040.73 Corrective Work - Complete all corrective Work within 15 Calendar Days after receiving
 the written notice of the required corrective Work to be taken. The 15-Day requirement excludes
 those days the Agency determines to be impractical for working.
 
 934
 
 01040.78
 The Contractor will be allowed to replace plants outside the Planting Season to perform corrective
 Work after each periodic inspection.
 Provide plant replacements of the same variety, size, and quality as specified for the original plants,
 unless otherwise approved.
 Notify the Agency when the corrective Work is complete. When the corrective Work has been
 re-inspected and is completed to the satisfaction of the Agency, the appropriate partial payment due
 the Contractor will be made.
 If the Contractor does not perform the corrective Work within the 15-Day period after written
 notification, excluding those days the Agency determines to be impractical for working, the Agency
 may have the corrective Work done by others and deduct the entire cost of the corrective Work from
 monies due or to become due the Contractor under the Contract.
 01040.75 Weed Control - Provide weed control according to 01030.42.
 01040.77 Plant Establishment (Ornamental Areas) - In addition to these plant establishment
 requirements, perform the following:
 (a) Watering, Fertilizing, and Mulching - Water all plants at the required intervals using the
 installed permanent or temporary irrigation systems, or such means as has been established for
 the Project. Avoid excessive watering of shrub areas adjacent to lawns that may leach herbicide
 and damage the lawn. Repair damaged lawns at no additional cost to the Agency.
 
 If specified for the original planting, re-fertilize plants to promote vigorous growth.
 Maintain the plant bed mulch at a 2 inch depth during establishment, unless otherwise specified.
 Rake to a smooth and even finish grade.
 (b) Trimming and Pruning - Prune in order to enhance the natural growth of plants, eliminate
 dead growth and crossing branches, maintain growth within available space, minimize overgrowth
 onto walks and walls, and minimize tree canopy damage from winds.
 
 Prune during the dormant season unless otherwise specified. Remove and dispose of all dead
 and critically damaged plant material to maintain the overall appearance of the Project.
 (c) Transplanted Specimen Plants - Care for transplanted specimen plants immediately after
 the planting Work is completed. Water, fertilize, and protect specimen plants against disease and
 infestation as required to ensure the plants remain healthy and vigorous. Final acceptance of
 transplanted specimen plants will depend on plant health and condition.
 (d) Sod Lawn - Mow, cut and fertilize sod lawns as required to maintain a healthy and vigorous
 condition. A schedule of feeding, mowing, and general treatment, including thatching and
 aeration will be listed in the Special Provisions. Final acceptance of sod lawn areas will depend
 on its health and condition. Keep sod lawns mowed to a height between 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches.
 
 Do not perform the first mowing until the sod is firmly rooted and secure in place. Remove no
 more than one-third of the grass leaf during initial or subsequent cuttings.
 01040.78 Plant Establishment (Mitigation or Other Non-Ornamental Areas):
 (a) Watering and Mulching - Water all plants as necessary to promote and maintain growth
 using temporary irrigation methods. Keep planted areas raked to a smooth and even finish
 grade. Maintain mulch within plant saucers at a 2 inch depth, unless otherwise specified.

 01050.43 Installing Posts and Braces:
 (a) General - Set all metal end posts, intermediate end posts, corner posts, gate posts, and
 chain link fence posts in concrete footings. Set all other posts firmly in the ground or in concrete
 footings as the Contractor elects.
 
 Set posts to the depths shown. Reasonable variation in depths will be allowed and posts may be
 appropriately shortened or left slightly high, as approved by the Engineer, to:
 • Avoid unnecessary penetration or excavation in Rock or other unusually firm material.
 • Obtain desired grades along the fence.
 Set all posts vertical, except on curved alignment set posts slightly off vertical, as directed, to
 offset the pull of the fence fabric and wires.
 For bridge protective fence only, set all metal end posts, intermediate end posts, and chain link
 fence posts as shown.
 (1) Driven Posts - Posts which are set by driving shall be free of damage when set. Remove
 and replace any driven posts which are split, twisted or bent, or have a badly misshapen tops.
 (2) Dug Holes - Where Rock is encountered, set the posts to depths of not less than
 18 inches and backfill with fine Granular Material. Do not exceed the post height shown by
 more than 3 inches.
 
 When posts are set in dug holes, backfill in 6 inch layers with each layer separately and
 thoroughly tamped and compacted.
 (3) Concrete Footings - Dimensions of footings shall not be less than shown and shall fill the
 excavated areas. Place the concrete with contact against firm Soil at the sides and bottom
 and tamp around the posts and brace ends after the posts and braces have been brought to
 and firmly held in proper position. Strike off, slope or crown and smooth the surface of the
 concrete at the ground level to shed water. Allow to cure for at least 5 Calendar Days before
 subjecting the posts and braces to strain.
 (b) End Posts - Set end posts:
 
 • At the beginning and end of new fence construction that is not terminating at gate posts.
 • At the end of the intersecting line of existing fences just outside the line of the new fence.
 (c) Intermediate End Posts - Set intermediate end posts in the line of the new fence:
 
 • At each summit and at each valley in the grade of the fence where the algebraic difference
 in the grades of adjoining panels of fence exceeds 30 percent.
 • At other points located along the new fence line to break the fence construction into
 approximately equal runs not exceeding the applicable lengths of runs shown.
 942
 
 01050.44
 (d) Corner Posts - Set corner posts as follows:
 (1) Barbed and Woven Wire Fences - At angle of deflection exceeding 5 for fences with
 steel line posts or 15 for fences with wood line posts. Changes in line where the angle of
 deflection does not exceed the above limitations will be considered alignment angles. The
 adjacent line posts at alignment angles shall be made fast to the angle post by means of
 diagonal tension wires.
 (2) Chain Link Fences - At angle points in fence alignment where the alignment of adjoining
 panels of fence changes direction by 20 or more.
 (e) Gate Posts - Set gate posts at the beginning or end of runs of fence to provide openings for
 gates or gateways.
 (f) Line Posts - Set line posts along the line of fence, between end, intermediate end, corner,
 and gate posts, and at the spacings shown. Line posts may be set at spacings not exceeding
 25 percent greater than specified or at closer spacings if approved. Set a line post in the new
 fence line at a point in alignment with each intersecting fence line approximately 1 foot from the
 end post of the intersecting fence line.
 
 It is intended that the actual number of line posts will average to the number required for normal
 spacing.
 (g) Braces - Construct braces before placing of fence fabric and wires on the posts.
 (1) Metal Braces - Provide corner posts and intermediate end posts with two braces, one
 each direction from the post in the main fence lines. Provide end posts and gate posts with
 one brace in the line of the fence as shown.
 
 Attach metal braces to the metal end, intermediate end, corner and gate posts and set in
 concrete footings.
 (2) Wood Braces - Assemble and construct treated wood braces in conjunction with treated
 wood end posts, intermediate end posts, corner posts and gate posts to form units as shown.
 Fasten the wire brace guys to posts with three staples in each post. By means of a wood
 lever, twist together the four strands of wire between the posts until the entire assembly is taut
 and firm. Leave the lever in place. Drive the staples to provide contact with the wires without
 indentation of the posts.
 01050.44 Barbed and Woven Wire Fence:
 (a) Placing Fabric and Wire - Place fabric and wire on the face of the post which is away from
 the Highway or as shown. On curved alignment, place the fabric and wire on the face of the post
 against which the normal pull of the fabric and wire will be exerted.
 
 Attach fence fabric and barbed wire to each post according to recognized standard practice for
 fence construction and as shown or directed.
 (b) Splicing Fabric and Wire - Splices of fabric and splices of separate lines of wire between
 posts will be allowed provided that not more than two fabric or separate wire splices, spaced at
 least 50 feet apart, occur in any one run of fence. Use wrap or telephone type splices for the
 longitudinal woven wire and barbed wire with each end wrapped around the other wire for not
 less than six complete turns.
 
 943
 
 01050.45
 (c) Stretching Fabric - Stretch the barbed wire and woven wire fabric. Use care in stretching
 woven wire fabric, so the pull is evenly distributed over the longitudinal wires and not more than
 one-half of the original depth of the tension curves is removed.
 (d) Fastening Fabric and Wire:
 (1) At End, Intermediate End, Corner, and Gate Posts - Terminate the fence fabric and
 barbed wire at each end, intermediate end, corner, and gate post in the new fence line. Wrap
 each line of barbed wire and each longitudinal wire of the fence fabric around the post and
 then itself with at least four turns.
 (2) At Line Posts - Fasten woven wire fabric to the post at top and bottom and at intermediate
 points not exceeding 12 inches apart. Fasten each line of barbed wire to each line post. Use
 approved wire ties or clamps to fasten the wires to metal posts. Drive staples, for use with
 wood posts, crosswise with the grain of the wood and pointed slightly downward. Drive the
 staples just short of actual contact with the wires to permit free longitudinal movement of those
 wires and to prevent damage to the protective coating.
 (3) At Intersection of New and Existing Fence - Where existing fences intersect the new
 fence, cut the existing fence materials, or splice basically in kind new materials as necessary,
 and fasten each longitudinal wire of the fabric and each line of barbed wire to the new end post
 according to 01050.44(d)(1).
 (e) Swinging Panels at Waterway Crossings - At waterway crossings subject to floating debris,
 if directed, construct wood framed swinging panels of fence fabric, barbed wire or combinations.
 Attach the panels to the lower wires of the fence to provide fenced closure of the waterway so
 there will be no unfenced side or bottom openings exceeding 6 inches when the waterway is at its
 lightest flow or is dry.
 (f) Additional Panels at Depressions - If depressions in the ground surface leave unfenced
 openings greater than 12 inches in height beneath the bottom line of the fence, provide additional
 panels of fence fabric, barbed wire, or combinations between line posts, as approved, across the
 opening so no side or bottom openings exceeds 6 inches. If the bottom line of the fence leaves
 an unfenced opening beneath it of 12 inches or less, pull the fabric and wires down between
 posts and anchor with pins or posts driven at least 18 inches into the ground so there will be no
 bottom opening at any point along the fence greater than 6 inches in height.
 (g) Stay Wires and Final Adjustments - Free the fabric and barbed wire in final position from
 warp and sag with stay wires placed approximately vertical to the grade of the fence.
 Appearance shall reflect first-class work. Retighten brace guys and leave the lever restrained
 against the fence fabric or fence wires.

 Construction
 01120.40 General - The irrigation Plans are a schematic design and may require adjustment. Do
 not install the sprinkler system as shown if it is evident that obstructions, grade differences, or
 differences in area dimensions create conditions different than anticipated in the design. Bring all
 such obstructions or differences to the attention of the Engineer. In the event this notification is not
 performed before construction begins on a part of the system where discrepancies exist, any
 revisions necessary to make the system operate as designed will be the Contractor's responsibility.
 (a) Plumbing - Install all parts of the irrigation system according to the Oregon Plumbing Code
 and State and local laws. Make water service connections as shown and specified. Conform to
 the requirements of the jurisdictional water authority. Ensure that water velocities in PVC pipe do
 not exceed 5 feet per second, unless approved in writing by the Agency. Bring any velocities
 exceeding 5 feet per second created by pipe sizes shown on the Plans to the attention of the
 Agency before beginning construction. Correct excess velocities existing after construction, or
 caused by changes from the Plans, at no additional cost to the Agency, unless a written
 agreement has been made authorizing otherwise.
 (1) Double Check Valve Assembly - Install, inspect, and test the double check valve
 assembly (DCVA) according to applicable regulations of the Oregon Health Division and the
 local water authority. Furnish test records on forms approved by the Oregon Health Division.
 Furnish forms filled out by a State-licensed Backflow Device Tester documenting that the

 Topsoil as the top layer when backfilling. Provide smooth trench bottoms of sand or other material,
 free from rocks and Unsuitable Material. Excavate trenches in Rock or other Unsuitable Material at
 least 6 inches below the required depth and backfill with sand or other suitable material free from
 rocks.
 
 958
 
 01120.44
 Exercise care when excavating near existing trees. Where roots are 2 inches and greater in
 diameter, except in the direct path of the pipe, hand excavate and tunnel the pipe trench. When
 large roots are exposed, wrap them with heavy burlap for protection and to prevent excessive
 drying. When digging trenches by machine adjacent to trees having roots 2 inches and less in
 diameter, hand trim the sides of the trench, making a clean cut of the roots. Treat all cut and
 trimmed roots 1/2 inch or larger in diameter with an approved tree wound dressing. Backfill
 trenches having exposed tree roots within 24 hours unless protected by continuously moist burlap or
 canvas.
 Place detectable marking tape and tracer wire in the trench directly above, parallel to, and along the
 entire length of all nonmetallic water pipes and all nonmetallic and aluminum conduits installed
 under existing or planned Pavement. Use tape widths recommended by the manufacturer for the
 burial depth.
 Pipe installation using a "pipe puller" may be approved if there is adequate Topsoil depth and the
 Topsoil is free of Rock. Obtain the Engineer's approval before using a pipe puller. Include any
 resultant changes in material or design with the request for use of this method.
 If unforeseen bedrock is encountered during excavation that prevents the pipe from being buried at
 the specified depth, immediately bring it to the attention of the Engineer.
 01120.43 Piping - Backfill all pipe between the top of the pipe and finished grade with a minimum
 of 18 inches of fill according to 01120.49. Where possible, place mains and laterals or section
 piping in the same trench. Separate all pipes by at least 2 inches. Place all pipelines a minimum
 of 3 feet from the edge of concrete sidewalks, curbs, guardrail, fences, traffic barriers or walls unless
 otherwise approved.
 
 Place marking tape and tracer wire above all pressurized mainline, according to the manufacturer's
 instructions.
 Place all live mains to be constructed under existing Pavement in sleeves jacked under the
 Pavement, unless otherwise shown. Place all PVC pipe installed under Pavement in pipe sleeves of

 80 PVC. Install sleeves 2 feet below Subgrade when passing under Roadways. Extend
 sleeves 2 feet beyond the edge of gravel, edge of sidewalk or back of curbs. Mark sleeves with
 a 2 feet piece of No. 4 rebar driven flush with the ground or other adjacent surface. Place PVC caps
 over both ends of sleeves but do not glue. Solvent-weld sleeve sections. Pipe bedding and backfill
 shall conform to Section 00405. Extend the sleeve a minimum of 12 inches beyond the edge of
 Pavement. Perform all jacking operations according to an approved jacking plan. If obstacles are
 encountered during required jacking, notify the Engineer, who may authorize corrective measures
 according to 00140.60. Provide for complete drainage of all pipelines with manual drain valves
 installed at section low points. Drain valves may not be shown on the Plans.
 01120.44 Pipe Jointing:
 (a) General - During construction, plug or cap pipe ends to prevent entry of dirt, rocks and
 other debris.
 (b) Galvanized Steel Pipe - Ensure that galvanized steel pipe has clean cut, well fitted standard
 pipe threads. Ream all pipe to its full diameter and remove burrs before assembly. Construct
 threaded joints using either a non-hardening, non-seizing multipurpose sealant, PTFE tape, or
 paste as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Make all threaded joints tight with wrenches,
 without using handle extensions. Clean and remake joints that leak with new material. Use of
 caulking or thread cement to make joints tight will not be allowed.
 
 959
 
 01120.45
 (c) PVC Pipe - Handle and install PVC pipe, couplings and fittings according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations. Chamfer the outside of the PVC pipe to a minimum
 of 1/16 inch at approximately 22 degrees. Join pipe and fittings by solvent welding. Use only
 solvents that penetrate the surface of both pipe and fitting with a result of complete fusion at the
 joint. Use solvent and cement only as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. On plastic to
 metal connections, work the metal connection first. Use a non-hardening compound on threaded
 connections. Thread connections between metal and plastic using only female threaded PVC
 adapters with threaded Schedule 80 PVC nipples.

 01120.46 Low Voltage Electrical Installation - Use direct burial wiring between the automatic
 controller and automatic valves. Install waterproof splices according to the manufacturer's
 recommendations. The wiring may share a common neutral. When more than one automatic
 controller is required, provide a separate common neutral for each controller and the automatic
 valves it controls. Run separate control conductors from the automatic controller to each valve.
 Provide and install an extra wire according to 01120.40.
 
 Install wire adjacent to or beneath the irrigation pipe. Use plastic tape or nylon tie-wraps to bundle
 wires together at 10 foot intervals. Snake the wire from side to side in the trench to provide slack in
 960
 
 01120.48
 the wire run. When it is necessary to run wire separate from the irrigation pipe, bundle and place
 the wire under detectable marking tape. Splices will be allowed only at junction boxes, valve boxes,
 pole bases, or control Equipment. Leave a minimum of 2 feet of excess conductor at all splices,
 terminals and control valves to facilitate inspection and future splicing.
 01120.47 Flushing and Testing:
 (a) General - Provide gauges used in the testing of water pressures that are certified correct by
 an independent testing laboratory immediately before use on the Project. Retest gauges when
 directed. Test automatic controllers by actual operation for a period of 2 weeks under normal
 operating conditions. If adjustments are required, adjust according to the manufacturer's
 direction and test until operation is accepted as satisfactory.
 (b) Sprinkler Head Flushing - Flush all sprinkler heads as recommended by the manufacturer.
 (c) Sprinkler Head Testing - Test for leaks in heads and connections and correct as required.
 (d) Main Line Flushing - To remove debris that may have entered the line during construction,
 flush main supply lines twice with the supply valve fully open. Flush first before placing valves
 and again after placing valves and before pressure testing.
 (e) Main Line Testing - Purge all main supply lines of air and test with static water pressure of at
 least 150 psi for 60 minutes without introduction of additional service or pumping pressure. Test
 with one pressure gauge installed on the line where directed. Install an additional pressure
 gauge at the pump when directed. Lines showing loss of pressure exceeding 5 psi at the end of
 the specified test period will be rejected. Correct rejected installations and retest for leaks.
 (f) Lateral Line Flushing - Flush all lateral lines once with the supply valve fully open prior to
 placement of sprinkler heads, emitters and drain valves. Flush long enough to remove any debris
 that enters the lateral lines during construction.
 (g) Lateral Line Testing - Purge all lateral lines of air and test under operating line pressures
 with risers capped and drain valves closed. Maintain operating line pressures for 30 minutes
 through open valves and pressure regulating devices. Lines showing leaks when visually
 inspected at the end of the specified test periods will be rejected. Correct and retest lateral line
 installations that have been rejected.
 (h) Lateral Line Alternate Test Method - When conditions prevent effective visual inspection of
 lateral lines, the Engineer may require that the lines be tested by use of pressure gauges. In that
 event, maintain the static water pressure equal to the operating line pressure in the lines
 for 30 minutes, with valves closed and without introduction of additional service pressure. Lateral
 lines showing loss of pressure exceeding 5 psi at the end of the specified test period will be
 rejected. Correct and retest lateral line installations that have been rejected.
 (i) Testing of Micro Tubing - Micro tubing will be tested by visual inspection while operating and
 before burial. Tubing that has obvious leaks or that doesn't operate as designed will be rejected.
 To fully test micro tubing, a water collection procedure recommended by the manufacturer may
 be required. Correct all faults before retesting.
 01120.48 Adjusting System - Before final inspection, adjust and balance all sprinklers to provide
 adequate and uniform coverage. Balance spray patterns by adjusting individual sprinkler heads with
 the adjustment screws or by replacing nozzles to produce a uniform pattern. Unless otherwise
 specified, water spray will not be allowed on Pavement, walks or Structures.
 
 961
 
 01120.49
 01120.49 Backfill - Do not start backfill until all piping has been inspected, tested and approved.
 Complete backfilling as soon as possible after approval. Ensure that backfill material placed
 within 6 inches of the pipe is free of rocks or other Unsuitable Material that might cut or otherwise
 damage the pipe. Backfill from the bottom of the trench to approximately 6 inches above the pipe
 with continuous compaction in a manner that will not damage the pipe or wiring, and proceed evenly
 on both sides of the pipe. Thoroughly compact the remainder of the backfill without using heavy
 Equipment within 18 inches of any pipe. Ensure that the top 6 inches of the backfill is Topsoil
 material or, if suitable, is the first 6 inches of material removed in the excavation.
 
 Pipe bedding material conforming to 00405.12 may be authorized in quantities determined by the
 Engineer. When authorized to proceed, fill the bottom 2 inches of the trench with approved bedding
 before laying pipe. After the pipe is in position, add enough bedding material to bring the backfill
 height to 2 inches above the pipe. Continue backfilling as usual.
 If sufficient suitable backfill material is not available from trench excavation or other sources on the
 Project, notify the Engineer. Provide an estimate of imported backfill required, if possible. Unless
 otherwise shown or specified, imported pipe bedding material will be authorized according
 to 00140.60.
 Maintenance
 01120.60 System Operation - Repair, flush and test all main and lateral lines that sustain a break
 or disruption of service. Upon restoration of the water service, bring the affected lines up to
 operating pressure. After pressurizing, conduct a thorough inspection of all sprinkler heads,
 emitters, and other fittings, located downstream of the break or disruption of service, and repair.
 This inspection is required to ensure that the entire irrigation system is operating properly.
 
 Completely install and test the irrigation system, and make it automatically operable before planting
 in a unit area except where otherwise shown, specified, or approved. Be fully responsible for all
 maintenance, repair, testing, inspection and automatic operation of the entire system until Final

 couplings, and secure with 2 inch wide polyethylene adhesive tape. Cover joints or seams in the
 polyethylene encasement using 2 inch wide polyethylene adhesive tape. The polyethylene
 encasement is not required to be watertight, but do not expose any part of the pipe, fittings, or
 coupling to the backfill. Exercise care during backfilling to prevent puncturing or otherwise
 damaging the polyethylene encasement.
 (b) Connections - When connecting to existing polyethylene-encased pipe, cut the existing
 encasement within 1 foot of the connection couplings or fittings. After the connections are made,
 overlap the exiting polyethylene encasement a minimum of 3 feet and seal the overlaps
 with 2 inch wide polyethylene adhesive tape.
 01140.44 Thrust Restraint:
 (a) Concrete Thrust Blocks - Place concrete thrust blocks as shown, at bends, tees, dead
 ends, and crosses. Pour concrete thrust blocks in place against solid, undisturbed earth at the
 sides and bottom of the trench excavation. Shape the blocks so as not to obstruct access to the
 joints of the pipe or fittings.
 (b) Restrained Joints - Where indicated or approved by the Engineer, restrain joints at bends,
 tees dead ends, crosses, and all pipe joints within the indicated or specified distance on each
 side of the bends, tees, dead ends, and crosses. Install joint restraint systems according to the
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 01140.45 Marking Tape and Wire:
 (a) Installation - Install marking tape and wire over all nonmetallic water lines, including service
 connections. Place a continuous solid copper wire along the top of all water pipe, including
 
 966
 
 01140.47
 service lines. Use cable ties to secure the copper wire to the top of the pipe at a maximum
 spacing of 10 feet. Tie all splices and make them electrically continuous and waterproof. Provide
 access to terminal ends of the wire at all valve boxes, meter boxes, hydrants, and vaults. The
 result of this installation shall be a continuous wire circuit electrically isolated from ground. Place
 the marking tape approximately 1 foot above the top of the pipe for its full length.
 (b) Accessibility - Make ends of wire accessible in water meter boxes, valve boxes or casings,
 or outside the foundation of buildings where the pipe enters the building. Provide wire access at
 locations no more than 1,000 feet apart.
 (c) Testing - Test for continuity and isolation from ground in the wire after all Work has been
 completed on the test section. Perform intermediate testing after backfilling operations and prior
 to surface restoration Work. Test continuity between access locations by use of a temporary wire
 connecting test points in-line with an ohmmeter. Measure resistance with an approved ohmmeter
 that has been properly calibrated. The continuity of a test section will be accepted if the
 resistance of the test section does not exceed 5 ohms for each 500 feet of location wire being
 tested. Measure isolation from ground with an approved 1000 volt Megger, applied for 1 minute.
 The isolation of a test section will be accepted if the isolation resistance of the test section is at
 least 10 megohms. Locate and repair all breaks or defects in the wire and re-test until specified
 results are obtained.
 01140.46 Blowoff Assemblies - Construct blowoff assemblies as shown and at the locations
 shown.
 01140.47 Connections to Existing Mains - Make necessary arrangements with the Engineer a
 minimum of 7 Calendar Days before making connections to existing water mains. Assemble all
 materials, Equipment, and labor necessary to properly complete the Work before starting.
 (a) Notification - If the connection to the existing system involves temporary water system
 shutoff, provide written notices to the residents affected by the shutoff a minimum of 72 hours
 before the shutoff. Submit a draft written notification to the Engineer for approval 5 Calendar
 Days before providing written notice to the affected residents. The Engineer will advise which
 property owners are to be notified.
 (b) Permission - The Work to perform the connection may need to be carried out during times
 other than normal working hours. Do not operate any valves on the existing system without
 specific permission of the Engineer.
 (c) Connection Assemblies - Excavate potholes to expose existing piping at connection points
 before constructing the connection.
 If existing piping is different than shown, provide
 measurements of depth and a detailed sketch of existing piping configuration and alignment to
 the Engineer not less than 2 weeks before the expected construction.
 (d) Uninterrupted Service - Once Work is started on a connection, proceed continuously
 without interruption, and as rapidly as possible until completed. Schedule main shutoffs to ensure
 that mains do not remain shut off overnight, on Fridays, over weekends, or on holidays.
 (e) Cutting Main Lines - Cut existing water mains according to 01140.12. Remove the portions
 of pipe to provide for the installation of the required fittings at the points of connection. Determine
 the exact length of the existing water main that is to be removed. Bevel pipe ends to prevent
 damage to the transition coupling gasket during installation of the coupling. Clean the exterior of
 the existing pipe end to a sound, smooth finish before installation of the coupling.
 
 967
 
 01140.48
 01140.48 Maintaining Service:
 (a) Service Transfer - Where existing services are to be transferred from old to new mains, plan
 and coordinate the Work with that of the Utility so that service will be resumed with the least
 possible inconvenience to the public.
 (b) Connections by Utility - Allow the Utility to make connections into the new pipe at such
 locations as the Utility may elect to supply customers with water, after the affected section of pipe
 has passed hydrostatic and bacteriological tests. The installation of any such connections by the
 Utility shall not be construed as an acceptance by the Agency of any part of the Work required
 under the Contract.
 01140.49 Backfilling - After the pipe is installed and inspected, backfill the trench according to
 Section 00405.
 Field Testing
 01140.50 Filling and Flushing - Fill pipes slowly with potable water at a maximum velocity
 of 1 foot per second while venting all air. Take all required precautions to prevent entrapping air in
 the pipes.
 (a) Flush and Disinfect - Flush sections of pipe to be tested and disinfect to remove any solids
 or contaminated material that may have become lodged in the pipe. Flushing velocity shall be a
 minimum of 3 feet per second. If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, provide a tap
 large enough to develop a velocity of at least 3 feet per second in the main. Perform flushing and
 disinfection according to AWWA C651-14
 (b) Taps - Provide taps for temporary or permanent release of air, flushing, or chlorination.
 (c) Disposal of Treated Water - Dispose of treated water flushed from mains. To protect
 aquatic life, de-chlorinate the treated waste water according to AWWA C655 before disposing of
 water into any storm drain or natural drainage channel. Dispose of disinfecting solution according
 to AWWA C655 and to the satisfaction of the Engineer and local authorities. If approved by the
 Engineer and the sanitary sewer Utility, disposal may be made to an available sanitary sewer,
 provided the rate of disposal will not overload the sewer.
 01140.51 Hydrostatic Testing:
 (a) General - Test all water mains and appurtenances in sections of convenient length under a
 hydrostatic pressure equal to one and one-half times the working pressure, but at least 150 psi,
 measured at the highest point of the test section. Furnish and operate all pumps, gauges, plugs,
 saddles, corporation stops, miscellaneous hose and piping, and measuring Equipment necessary
 for performing the test. Provide certifications of accuracy for gauges used in the test from an
 approved laboratory.
 (1) Backfill - Backfill the pipeline sufficiently to prevent movement of the pipe under pressure.
 Place all thrust blocks and allow time for the concrete to cure before testing. Where
 permanent blocking is not required, furnish and install temporary blocking and remove it after
 testing.
 (2) Filling Pipe - Fill the mains with water and allow to stand under pressure a sufficient
 length of time to allow the escape of air and to allow the lining of the pipe to absorb water. The
 Agency will furnish the water necessary to fill the pipelines for testing, at a time of day when
 sufficient quantities of water are available for normal system operation.
 
 968
 
 01140.51
 (3) Time Test - Test by pumping the main up to the required pressure for at least 2 hours.
 Provide additional pumping during the test period to continuously maintain pressure
 within 5 psi of that required. During the test, observe the section being tested to detect any
 visible leakage. Use a clean container to hold water for pumping up pressure on the main
 being tested. Sterilize this makeup water by adding chlorine to a concentration of 25 ppm.
 (4) Measure Quantity - Accurately determine the quantity of water required to maintain and
 restore the required pressure at the end of the test period by pumping through an approved
 positive displacement water meter.
 (5) Loss Formula - The quantity of water lost from the main shall not exceed the number of
 gallons per hour determined by the formula:
 ½
 
 L
 
 =
 
 SD(P)
 148,000
 
 Where:
 L
 S
 D
 P
 
 =
 =
 =
 =
 
 allowable leakage in gallons per hour
 length of pipeline tested in feet
 nominal diameter of the pipe in inches
 average test pressure during the leakage test in psi
 
 (6) Pressure Loss - There shall be no appreciable or abrupt loss in pressure during the test
 period.
 (7) Leakage - Correct all visible leakage regardless of the allowable leakage specified above.
 If the actual leakage exceeds the allowable amount, locate and repair the leaks and retest the
 pipeline.
 (8) Use of Hydrant Valves - Make all tests with the hydrant auxiliary gate valves open and
 pressure against the hydrant valve. After the pipe test has been completed, test each gate
 valve in turn by closing it and relieving the pressure beyond. This test of the gate valve will be
 acceptable if there is no immediate loss of pressure on the gauge when the pressure beyond
 the valve is relieved. Verify that the pressure differential across the valve does not exceed the
 rated working pressure of the valve.
 (9) Test Section Length - Limit sections to be tested to 1,500 feet, unless longer test sections
 are approved. The Engineer may require that the first installed section of pipe installed by
 each crew, not less than 1,000 feet in length, be tested. Do not continue pipe laying more than
 an additional 1,000 feet until the first section has been tested successfully.
 (10) Test Equipment Readiness - Prior to calling out the Engineer to witness the pressure
 test, set up all Equipment completely ready for operation and successfully perform the test to
 ensure that the pipe is in a satisfactory condition.
 (11) Defective Materials or Workmanship - Replace defective materials or workmanship
 discovered during hydrostatic field testing. Whenever it is necessary to replace defective
 material or correct the workmanship, repeat the hydrostatic test until a satisfactory test is
 obtained.
 (b) Testing Extensions from Existing Mains:
 (1) Exceptions - When an existing water main is extended with new pipe to a new valve, and
 the distance from the existing pipe to the new valve is 18 feet or less, no hydrostatic test will be
 required if the section of new pipe between the new valve and the end of the existing main is
 
 969
 
 01140.51
 installed with pretested, prechlorinated pipe. When the required hydrostatic tests are
 conducted in the new main section beyond the installed new valve in the closed position, the
 normal pressure of the existing main may be present against the other side of the new valve.
 (2) Required Testing - Where the distance between the end of an existing water main pipe
 extension and the new valve is more than 18 feet, do not connect the new pipe to the existing
 pipe until after hydrostatic tests have been made to the required pressure in both directions
 against the new valve. Test after installing a temporary cap or plug on the end of the new
 pipe, beyond the new valve, as close as possible to the existing pipe. Make the final
 connection to the existing main with pretested, prechlorinated pipe.
 (c) Testing Sections with Hydrants Installed - When hydrants are included with the section of
 main pipe to be tested, conduct three separate tests as shown in the following table:
 
 Test No. 1
 Test No. 2
 Test No. 3

 Test each hydrant to the required test pressure. When testing a hydrant singly,
 pressure in the supply main beyond the hydrant auxiliary gate valve shall be 25 psi.
 
 (d) Testing Hydrants Installed on Existing Mains - For hydrants installed and connected to
 existing mains, install the hydrant connection, including hydrant tee, connection pipe and auxiliary
 gate valves, with pretested materials.
 
 Before the hydrant connection is made to the existing main, subject the hydrant installation to
 hydrostatic Test No. 3 in 01140.51(c).
 (e) Hydrostatic Testing of High Density Polyethylene Water Mains - Conduct the following
 hydrostatic tests on all HDPE pipe:
 (1) Above-Grade Test - Before placing the pipe but after the pipe is butt fused and ready for
 installation, conduct an above grade test. Before beginning the test, fill the pipeline with water,
 pressurize to the test pressure according to 01140.51(a), and allow to stand without makeup
 pressure until the pressure reaches equilibrium. Equilibrium will usually occur within 2 to
 4 hours.
 
 After equilibrium has been reached, test the pipe according to 01140.51(a). Visually inspect
 the pipe for leaks during the test. Repair all leaks before installing the pipe in the trench or
 pulling the pipeline into the borehole. Repair leaks at fusion joints by cutting out the leaking
 fusion joint, re-fusing the joint, and conducting a new above grade test. Successful completion
 of the above grade test requires approval from the Engineer. Do not place the pipe in the
 trench or pull the pipe into place before successfully completing the above grade test.
 (2) In-Place Test - Conduct an in place test after the pipe is placed in the trench or pulled into
 place. Before beginning the test, fill the pipeline with water, pressurize to the test pressure
 according to 01140.51(a), and allowed to stand without makeup pressure until the pressure
 reaches equilibrium. Equilibrium will usually occur within 2 to 4 hours.
 
 970
 
 01140.52
 01140.52 Disinfecting:
 (a) General - Before placing new water mains in service, chlorinate and test new mains and
 repaired portions of, or extensions to, existing mains according to AWWA C651-14 and obtain a
 satisfactory bacteriological report.
 
 The initial chlorine content of the water shall be not less than 25 ppm. A chlorine residual of not
 less than 10 ppm shall remain in the water after standing 24 hours in the pipe.
 (b) Chlorine Application - Apply chlorine by one of the following methods:
 (1) Calcium Hypochlorite - Apply a mixture of water and high-test calcium hypochlorite
 (65 - 70 percent Cl). First mix the dry powder as a paste and then thin to a 1 percent chlorine
 solution by adding water to give a total quantity of 7.5 gallons per pound (water to dry powder).
 (2) Sodium Hypochlorite - Apply sodium hypochlorite, commercial grade (12.5 percent Cl) or
 in the form of liquid household bleach (5 - 6 percent Cl). This liquid chlorine compound may be
 used full strength or diluted with water.
 (c) Point of Application - Apply the chlorinating agent at the beginning of the pipeline extension
 or any valved section of it, through a corporation stop inserted in the horizontal axis of the pipe.
 Supply the water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe from a tap on the
 pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline extension. Alternate points of
 applications may be used when approved.
 (d) Rate of Application - Control water from the existing distribution system, or other source of
 supply, to flow very slowly into the newly laid pipeline during application of the chlorine. The rate
 of chlorine application shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the newly laid pipe
 that the initial chlorine content of the water will be at least 25 ppm.
 (e) Cross Connection Control - Make no connections between the existing distribution system
 and non-disinfected pipelines constructed under this Contract, unless a State Health Division
 approved backflow preventer is installed in the connecting line.
 (f) Retention Period - Retain chlorinated water in the pipe at least 24 hours. After this period,
 the residual chlorine at pipe extremities and at other representative points shall be at least
 10 ppm.
 (g) Chlorinating Connections to Existing Water Mains - Follow the chlorinating procedure
 specified in AWWA C651-14. Liberally treat the exterior of the existing main at the connection
 point with hypochlorites. Swab or spray the interior of all new closure fittings, valves, and pipe
 required for the connection with a 1 percent hypochlorite solution. Disinfect the 5 feet of existing
 main adjacent to the connection point with a 100 ppm chlorine solution and then thoroughly flush
 the line.
 (h) Flushing and Testing - Following the retention period, flush all chlorinated water from the
 newly laid pipe until the replacement water throughout its length is visually clear and shows, upon
 test, an absence of chlorine or a residual no greater than that normally found in the source of
 supply.
 (1) Sampling Tap - Install a sampling tap ahead of the flushing hose for convenient sanitary
 sampling.
 (2) Sampling Frequency for New Mains - For new mains, collect one set of samples every
 1200 feet along the pipe and one set at the end of the pipe. If water from the trench enters the
 
 971
 
 01140.60
 pipe or, in the opinion of the Engineer, excessive quantities of dirt or debris have entered the
 new main, increase sampling frequency to collect a sample set every 200 feet along the pipe,
 in addition to the sample set required at the pipe end.
 (3) Service Resumption - Do not place the lines into service before a satisfactory report is
 received from the local or State health department on samples collected from representative
 points in the new system. Samples will be collected and bacteriological tests obtained by the
 Engineer.
 (i) Repetition of Chlorinating and Testing - If the initial treatment results in a chlorine residual
 of less than 10 ppm at the end of the retention period or an unsatisfactory bacteriological test,
 repeat the original chlorination procedure until satisfactory results are obtained.
 01140.60 Surface Restoration - Restore trench surfaces according to Section 00495.
 Measurement
 01140.80 Measurement - The quantities of potable water pipe and fittings will be determined as
 follows:
 (a) Pipe, Fittings and Couplings - The quantities of pipe of the various kinds, types, sizes and
 backfill classes will be measured on the length basis and will be horizontal measurement along
 the top of the finished trench, with no deduction for fittings, valves, and couplings.
 
 For PVC fittings 4 inches or greater, in addition to measurement of the pipe, an allowance of 12
 pipe diameters will be made for each factory-fabricated bend, sleeve, reducer or coupling, and an
 allowance of 18 pipe diameters of the larger diameter pipe will be made for each factoryfabricated tee or cross. The allowance will be added to the quantity for pipe of the same
 diameter.
 Ductile iron pipe fittings will be measured on the unit basis.
 (b) Extra Trench Excavation - The quantities of removal and backfill of extra trench excavation
 will be measured on the volume basis for each backfill class. The backfill classes are defined in
 Section 00405. When the pipeline grade is lowered in excess of 12 inches below the grade
 shown, or when pipeline horizontal alignment is changed by more than 12 inches after the original
 trench has been excavated, all additional excavation and backfill, outside the limits of the original
 trench, that is required to construct the change will be classified as extra trench excavation. The
 depth will be the actual depth removed for the changed line or grade as directed. The width will
 be the actual width removed for the changed line or grade, but in no case will the measured width
 exceed the allowable widths specified in 00405.41(c).
 (c) Blowoff Assemblies - The quantities of blowoff assemblies will be measured on the unit
 basis.
 (d) Connections to Existing Mains - The quantities of connections to existing mains will be
 measured on the unit basis.
 
 Trench resurfacing will be measured according to 00495.80.
 Installation under Pavement by tunneling, jacking, or boring methods will be measured according
 to 00406.80.

 (a) Rotational Capacity Test - Test all high-strength fasteners, except tie rods, anchor bolts,
 and anchor rods, according to Method 1 or 2 below, as applicable. Perform the test on coated or
 galvanized fasteners after coating, galvanizing, oversize tapping and lubricating. Use nuts from
 those supplied with the bolts for the job. Use washers for this testing. Repeat the rotational
 capacity test at the job site prior to installation to verify the effectiveness of the lubricant. The
 rotational capacity test is not required for lock-pin and collar fasteners. Use Method 1 for long
 bolts and Method 2 for short bolts.
 
 Test each combination of bolt production lot, nut lot and washer lot as an assembly. Assign a
 rotational capacity lot number to each combination of lots tested. The minimum frequency of
 testing shall be two assemblies per rotational capacity lot. The test shall meet one of the
 following requirements:
 (1) Method 1 - Place the lubricated fastener, including a washer, in a device capable of
 indicating direct bolt tension. Use spacers and/or washers with the hole size the same nominal
 diameter as the hole in the washer for the fastener to be tested. Allow three to five full threads
 of the bolt to be exposed between the bearing surfaces of the bolt head and the nut. Tighten
 the nut to a snug-tight condition to produce an initial load in the bolt equal to 10 percent of the
 tension required in Table 00560-1 of Section 00560. Mark the nut's position relative to the
 fixed bolt for this snug-tight position. Tighten the nut using a calibrated torque wrench and
 record the measured torque with the nut in motion to reach the tension required by
 Table 00560-1.
 
 1058
 
 02560.60
 The above measured torque to produce the required bolt tensions shall not exceed the torque
 value calculated by the following equation:
 T = 0.25 PD
 Where:
 
 T = Torque in foot pounds
 P = Measured Bolt Tension in pounds
 D = Nominal Bolt Diameter in feet
 
 Reject assemblies with torque values exceeding the calculated value.
 Continue to tighten the nut until the nut has turned twice the rotation shown in Table 00560-3
 of Section 00560 from its snug-tight position mark. Record the measured bolt tension. The
 tension shall not be less than 1.15 times the tension shown in Table 00560-1. Reject
 assemblies not meeting this tension.
 Loosen and remove the nut. Examine the threads on the nut and bolt. Reject assemblies
 showing evidence of thread shear failure, stripping or torsional failure of the bolt.
 (2) Method 2 - Bolts that are too short to be tested in a direct bolt tension indicating device
 shall be tested in a steel joint.
 
 Place the lubricated fastener including a washer in one or more flat structural steel plates. The
 total thickness including the washer shall be such that three to five full threads of the bolt are
 located between the bearing surfaces of the bolt head and the nut. The hole in the joint shall
 have the same nominal diameter as the hole in the washer. Using a calibrated torque wrench,
 tighten the nut to a snug-tight condition to produce an initial torque in the bolt equal to
 approximately 10 percent of the torque calculated using the equation given in Method 1 above
 where P shall be the minimum tension in the bolt according to Table 00560-1 of
 Section 00560. Mark the nut's position relative to the fixed bolt for this snug tight position.
 Using the calibrated torque wrench, further tighten the nut until the nut has turned the rotation
 shown in Table 00560-3 of Section 00560 from its snug-tight position mark. Prevent the bolt
 head from turning during the tightening process. Record the measured torque with the nut in
 motion. The measured torque shall not exceed 1.15 times the torque value calculated in the
 preceding step of Method 2. Reject assemblies with torque values exceeding the calculated
 value.
 Tighten the nut further until the nut has turned twice the rotation shown in Table 00560-3 from
 its snug-tight position mark. Reject assemblies which fail this rotation either by stripping or
 fracture.
 Loosen and remove the nut. Examine the threads on the nut and bolt. Reject assemblies
 showing evidence of thread shear failure, stripping or torsional failure of the bolt.
 (3) Shipping - Ship bolts, nuts and washers from each rotational capacity test lot in the same
 container. If there is only one rotational capacity test lot for each size of bolt, the bolts, nuts

 bearing of equal or greater capacity is acceptable provided the data is no more than 2 years old.
 Test typical bearings either by an independent testing laboratory, or have the testing witnessed and
 attested to by an independent testing laboratory, for compliance with specified performance
 requirements as listed below. Provide a test results certificate according to 00165.35 with the
 submittal of shop drawings. Perform the following tests:
 (a) Clearance Test - Move the components of the bearing through their design displacements or
 rotations to verify that the required clearances exist. If the test is conducted on a rotational
 component which is not under simultaneous full vertical load, make allowance for the
 displacements which would be caused by that load.
 (b) Long-Term Deterioration Test - Conduct test on one full scale bearing per lot. Load the
 bearing in compression to a stress corresponding to 100 percent of the maximum dead plus live
 service load while subjected to plus and minus the design rotational displacement amplitude for
 5,000 cycles. Flat sliding systems shall be displaced through at least 1,000 cycles with an
 amplitude of at least ± 1.0 inch (2.0 inch peak to peak). The sliding may take place at up to
 10.0 inch per minute, except when readings of the coefficient of friction are taken, at which time
 the sliding speed shall be 2.5 inches per minute.
 
 Bearings will be rejected when:
 • There are visible cracks, splits, or excessive wear on disassembly of the bearing.
 • The coefficient of friction exceeds two-thirds the value used in design.
 
 1063
 
 02570.30
 (c) Friction Test - Conduct test on one full scale bearing per lot. The coefficient of friction
 between the sliding surfaces shall not be greater than 0.06 when the maximum working stress for
 the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface is 2,000 psi. It shall not be greater than 0.045 when
 the maximum working stress for the PTFE surface is above 3,000 psi. Determine the coefficient
 of friction at 68 °F according to the requirements of section 18.3.4.3.2 of the AASHTO LRFD
 Bridge Construction Specifications.
 (d) Proof Load Test:
 (1) Vertical Proof Load Test - Apply a vertical load equal to 150 percent of the vertical design
 capacity of the tested bearing for 5 minutes, unload, then reapply for an additional 5 minutes.
 Place the bearing in a rotated position during the test. Rotation shall be 0.015 radians or the
 design rotation, whichever is greater. The test bearing shall show no indication of failure or
 other defects such as weld cracking, plate distortion, extrusion of the elastomer or bearing
 material, or displacement of the elastomer seal while under load or subsequently upon
 disassembly and inspection.
 
 The successful test of a bearing with a vertical design capacity of 50 tons or less will be
 accepted as qualification for all bearings of a similar design with a lesser design capacity.
 (2) Horizontal Proof Load Test - A horizontal proof load test is required when the design
 horizontal capacity exceeds 10 percent of the design vertical capacity and no engineer's
 calculations are submitted. Apply a horizontal load equal to 100 percent of the horizontal
 design capacity while also applying a vertical load equal to 100 percent of the dead load for a
 period of 2 minutes. The bearing does not need to be in the rotated position. The bearing
 shall show no indication of failure or other defects such as weld cracking, plate distortion,
 extrusion of the elastomer or bearing material, or displacement of the elastomer seal while
 under load or subsequently upon disassembly and inspection.
 
 The bearing tested for horizontal proof load may be either a bearing specified for use on the
 Project or a similar type bearing with both a vertical design capacity and a horizontal design
 capacity within 10 percent of the design capacities of bearings specified for use on the Project.
 02570.30 Acceptance - For each composite bearing used in the Structure, provide the
 manufacturer's quality compliance certificate according to 00165.35 that verifies the bearing has
 been manufactured according to the design of the tested bearing.
