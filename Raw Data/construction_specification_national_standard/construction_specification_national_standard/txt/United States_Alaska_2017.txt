 extending the unit bid prices, or in totaling the extensions, or if an extension is missing. The
 results of the bid comparisons will be made available to the public as soon as practicable.
 Until the Award, the Department may reject any or all bids, waive minor informalities or advertise
 for new bids without liability to any bidder if the Department, in its discretion, determines that to
 do so is in the best interests of the State.
 A bidder may request withdrawal of a bid after opening and before the Award only in accordance
 with AS 36.30.160(b) and State procurement regulations. Submit the request to the Contracting
 Officer.
 An interested party, as defined in AS 36.30.699, may protest a proposed Award of contract as per
 AS 36.30.560 and AS 36.30.565. Submit the protest to the Contracting Officer.
 On wholly state-funded projects, determination of the low bidder will include bidder preferences
 as required under AS 36.30.321, according to subsections 1-3 below.
 Alaska Bidder
 Preferences, Alaska Veteran’s Preference, and Alaska Product preference are not applicable on
 projects with federal funding.
 1. Alaska Bidder Preference: If the bidder qualifies as an Alaska Bidder, a five percent (5%)
 preference will be applied to the price of the bid. "Alaska bidder" means a person who:
 a. holds a current Alaska business license;
 b. submits a bid for goods, services, or construction under the name as appearing on the
 person's current Alaska business license;
 c.
 
 has maintained a place of business within the state staffed by the bidder or an employee
 of the bidder for a period of six months immediately preceding the date of the bid;
 
 d. is incorporated or qualified to do business under the laws of the state, is a sole
 proprietorship and the proprietor is a resident of the state, is a limited liability company
 organized under AS 10.50 and all members are residents of the state, or is a partnership
 under former AS 32.05, AS 32.06, or AS 32.11 and all partners are residents of the state;
 and
 e. If a joint venture, is composed entirely of ventures that qualify under (a) through (d),
 above.
 2. Alaska Veteran’s Preference: If a bidder qualifies as an Alaska bidder and is a qualifying
 entity, an Alaska Veteran’s Preference of 5 percent shall be applied to the bid price. The
 preference may not exceed $5,000 (AS 36.30.321). A “qualifying entity” means a:
 a. sole proprietorship owned by an Alaska veteran;
 b. partnership under AS 32.06 or AS 32.11 if a majority of the partners are Alaska veterans;
 c.
 
 limited liability company organized under AS 10.50 if a majority of the members are
 Alaska veterans; or
 
 d. corporation that is wholly owned by individuals, and a majority of the individuals are
 Alaska veterans.
 13
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 103
 
 A preference under this section is in addition to any other preference for which the bidder
 qualifies.
 To qualify for this preference, the bidder must add value by the bidder itself actually
 performing, controlling, managing and supervising a significant part of the services provided
 or the bidder must have sold supplies of the general nature solicited to other state agencies,
 governments, or the general public.
 An Alaska veteran is a resident of Alaska who:
 (1) served in the Armed forces of the United States, including a reserve unit of the United
 States armed forces; or the Alaska Territorial Guard, the Alaska Army National
 Guard, the Alaska Air National Guard, or the Alaska Navel Militia; and
 (2) was separated from service under a condition that was not dishonorable.
 The bidder shall provide an Alaska Veteran’s Preference Affidavit on Form 25D-17, certifying
 they qualify as an Alaska bidder eligible for Alaska Veteran’s preference according to AS
 36.30.
 3. Alaska Product Preference: Except for timber, lumber and manufactured lumber products
 used in the construction project under AS 36.30.322(b), an Alaska products preference will
 be given as required under AS 36.30.326 - 36.30.332 when the bidder designates the use of
 Alaska products.
 The bidder shall complete the Alaska Products Preference Worksheet, according to the
 worksheet instructions, and submit the completed worksheet with their bid.
 If the successful bidder/contractor proposes to use an Alaska product and does not do so, a
 penalty will be assessed against the successful bidder/contractor according to AS
 36.30.330(a).
 Each Alaska product declared on the Alaska Product Preference Worksheet must have an
 “Approval” date on the Alaska Product Preference Program List, that is on or before the bid
 opening date for this contract, and that does not expire before the bid opening date for this
 contract.
 103-1.02 SUBCONTRACTOR LIST. The apparent low bidder shall submit a completed
 Subcontractor List, Form 25D-5, within five working days following receipt of written notification by
 the Department that it is the low bidder.
 An apparent low bidder who fails to submit a completed Subcontractor List form within the time
 allowed will be declared nonresponsible and may be required to forfeit the bid security. The
 Department will then consider the next lowest bidder for award of the Contract.
 If a bidder fails to list a subcontractor, or lists more than one subcontractor for the same portion of
 work, and the value of that work is in excess of one-half of one percent of the total bid amount,
 the bidder agrees to perform that portion of work without a subcontractor and represents that it is
 qualified to perform that work.
 A bidder who lists as a subcontractor another contractor who, in turn, sublets the majority of the
 work required under the Contract, violates this subsection.
 A bidder or Contractor may, without penalty, replace a listed subcontractor who:
 1. Fails to comply with licensing and registration requirements of AS 08.18;
 
 14
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 103
 
 2. Fails to obtain a valid Alaska business license;
 3. Files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent;
 4. Fails to execute a subcontract for performance of the work for which the subcontractor was
 listed, and the bidder acted in good faith;
 5. Fails to obtain bonding acceptable to the Department;
 6. Fails to obtain insurance acceptable to the Department;
 7. Fails to perform the subcontract work for which the subcontractor was listed;
 8. Must be replaced to meet the bidder's required state or federal affirmative action
 requirements;
 9. Refuses to agree or abide with the bidder's labor agreement; or
 10. Is determined by the Department to be not responsible.
 In addition to the circumstances described above, a Contractor may in writing request permission
 from the Department to add a new subcontractor or replace a listed subcontractor. The
 Department will approve the request if it determines in writing that allowing the addition or
 replacement is in the best interest of the State.
 A bidder or Contractor shall submit a written request to add a new subcontractor or replace a
 listed subcontractor to the Contracting Officer a minimum of five working days before the date the
 new subcontractor is scheduled to begin work on the construction site. The request must state
 the basis for the request and include supporting documentation acceptable to the Contracting
 Officer.
 If a bidder violates this subsection, the Contracting Officer may:
 1. Cancel the Contract after Award without any damages accruing to the Department; or
 2. After notice and a hearing, assess a penalty on the bidder in an amount not exceeding 10
 percent of the value of the subcontract at issue.
 103-1.03 AWARD OF CONTRACT. The Department will award the Contract to the lowest
 responsible and responsive bidder unless it rejects all bids. The Department will notify all bidders
 in writing of its intent to award.
 The Department will notify the successful bidder in writing of its intent to award the Contract and
 request that certain required documents, including the Contract Form, bonds, and insurance be
 submitted within the time specified. The successful bidder's refusal to sign the Contract and
 provide the requested documents within the time specified may result in cancellation of the notice
 of intent to award and forfeiture of the bid security.
 If an award is made, it will be made as soon as practicable and usually within 40 days after bid
 opening. Award may be delayed due to bid irregularities or a bid protest, or if the award date is
 extended by mutual consent. Bids shall be valid for 120 days after bid opening, and may be
 extended by mutual consent.
 103-1.04 RETURN OF BID GUARANTY. The Department will return bid guaranties, other than
 bid bonds:
 1. To all except the two lowest responsive and responsible bidders, as soon as practicable after
 the opening of bids; and
 15
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 103
 
 2. To the two lowest responsive and responsible bidders immediately after Contract award.
 103-1.05 PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS. The successful bidder shall furnish all
 required Performance and Payment Bonds on forms provided by the Department for the sums
 specified in the Contract. If no sum is specified, the successful bidder shall comply with AS
 36.25.010. The Surety on each bond may be any corporation or partnership authorized to do
 business in the state as an insurer under AS 21.09 or two individual sureties approved by the
 Contracting Officer.
 If individual sureties are used, two individual sureties must each provide the Department with
 security assets located in Alaska equal to the penal amount of either the performance bond or the
 payment bond. Any costs incurred by the Contractor and the individual Surety are subsidiary and
 shall be borne by the Contractor or the individual Surety. In no event will the Department be liable
 for these costs.
 Individual sureties shall provide security by one, or a combination, of the following methods:
 1. Escrow Account, with a federally insured financial institution, in the name of the Department.
 Acceptable securities include, but are not limited to, cash, treasury notes, bearer instruments
 having a specific value, or money market certificates.
 2. Irrevocable letters of credit, from a financial institution approved by the Contracting Officer,
 with the Department named as beneficiary.
 3. Cashier’s or certified check made payable to the State of Alaska issued by financial
 institutions approved by the Contracting Officer.
 These bonds and security assets, as applicable, shall remain in effect for 12 months after the
 date of final payment or, if longer, until all obligations and liens under this Contract are satisfied,
 including, but not limited to, obligations under Subsection 107-1.19.
 The Department may, in its discretion, notify the bonding company or Surety of any potential
 default or liability.
 The Contractor shall substitute, within five working days, another bond or surety acceptable to the
 Department if an individual Surety or the Surety on any bond furnished in connection with the
 Contract:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt;
 Loses its right to do business in any state affecting the work;
 Ceases to meet Contract requirements;
 Fails to furnish reports of financial condition upon request; or
 Otherwise becomes unacceptable to the Department.
 
 When approved by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor may replace:
 1. An individual surety with a corporate surety; or
 2. Posted collateral with substitute collateral.
 Failure to maintain the specified bonds or to provide substitute bonds when required under this
 section may be grounds for withholding contract payments until substitute bonding is obtained,
 and may, in the Department's discretion, be grounds for declaring the Contractor in default.
 103-1.06 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. The Contractor shall provide evidence of insurance
 with an insurance carrier or carriers satisfactory to the Department covering injury to persons and
 property suffered by the State of Alaska or by a third party as a result of operations under this
 contract by the Contractor or by any subcontractor. The Contractor's insurance shall provide
 16
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 103
 
 protection against injuries to all employees of the Contractor and the employees of any
 subcontractor engaged in work under this Contract. All insurance policies shall be issued by
 insurers that (1) are permitted to transact the business of insurance in the State of Alaska under
 AS 21 and (2) have a financial rating acceptable to the Department. A certificate of insurance
 must be furnished to the Department prior to award. The certificate of insurance must provide for
 notice of cancellation, non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with policy
 provisions.
 Where specific limits and coverages are shown, it is understood that they shall be the minimum
 acceptable. The requirements of this subsection shall not limit the Contractor’s indemnity
 responsibility under Subsection 107-1.13. Additional insurance requirements specific to this
 contract are contained in the Special Provisions, when applicable.
 The Contractor shall maintain the following policies of insurance with the specified minimum
 coverages and limits in force at all times during the performance of the Contract:
 1. Workers' Compensation: as required by AS 23.30.045, for all employees of the Contractor
 engaged in work under this Contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for Workers'
 Compensation Insurance for any subcontractor who performs work under this Contract. The
 coverage shall include:
 a. Waiver of subrogation against the State;
 b. Employer's Liability Protection at $500,000 each accident/each employee and $500,000
 policy limit;
 c.
 
 “Other States” endorsement if the Contractor directly utilizes labor outside of the State of
 Alaska;
 
 d. United States Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Act Endorsement, whenever the work
 involves activity over or about navigable water; and
 e. Maritime Employer’s Liability (Jones Act) Endorsement with a minimum limit of
 $1,000,000, whenever the work involves activity from or on a vessel on navigable water.
 2. Commercial General Liability: on an occurrence policy form covering all operations with
 combined single limits not less than:
 a. $1,000,000 Each Occurrence;
 b. $1,000,000 Personal Injury;
 c.
 
 $2,000,000 General Aggregate; and
 
 d. $2,000,000 Products-Completed Operations Aggregate.
 3. Automobile Liability: covering all vehicles used in Contract work, with combined single limits
 not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence.
 4. Umbrella Coverage: for Contract amounts over $5,000,000 not less than $5,000,000 umbrella
 or excess liability. Umbrella or excess policy shall include products liability completed
 operations coverage and may be subject to $5,000,000 aggregate limits. Further, the
 umbrella or excess policy shall contain a clause stating that it takes effect (drops down) in the
 event the primary limits are impaired or exhausted.
 The State of Alaska shall be named as an additional insured on policies required by items 2 thru
 4 above. All of the above insurance coverages shall be considered to be primary and non17
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 103
 
 contributory to any other insurance carried by the State of Alaska, whether through self-insurance
 or otherwise.
 In any contract or agreement with subcontractors performing work, the Contractor shall require
 that all indemnities and waivers of subrogation it obtains, and any stipulation to be named as an
 additional insured it obtains, shall also be extended to waive rights of subrogation against the
 State of Alaska and to add the State of Alaska as an additional named indemnitee and as an
 additional insured.
 The apparent low bidder shall furnish evidence of insurance to the Department before award of
 the Contract. The evidence shall be issued to the Department and shall be either a certificate of
 insurance or the policy declaration page with all required endorsements attached and must:
 1. Denote the type, amount, and class of operations covered;
 2. Show the effective (and retroactive) dates of the policy;
 3. Show the expiration date of the policy;
 4. Include all required endorsements;
 5. Be executed by the carrier's representative; and
 6. If a certificate of insurance, include the following statement:
 “This is to certify that the policies described herein comply with all aspects of the insurance
 requirements of (Project Name and Number). The insurance carrier agrees that it shall notify
 the Engineer, in writing, at least 30 days before cancellation of any coverage or reduction in
 any limits of liability.”
 The Department’s acceptance of deficient evidence of insurance does not constitute a waiver of
 Contract requirements.
 Failure to maintain the specified insurance or to provide substitute insurance if an insurance
 carrier becomes insolvent, is placed in receivership, declares bankruptcy, or cancels a policy may
 be grounds for withholding Contract payments until substitute insurance is obtained, and may, in
 the Department's discretion, be sufficient grounds for declaring the Contractor in default.
 103-1.07 EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACT. The successful bidder shall execute
 and return the Contract Form and all other required documents to the Department within the time
 specified, or within 15 days after receipt by the bidder if no time is specified. A contract is
 awarded only after it has been signed by the Contracting Officer.
 103-1.08 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT. If the successful bidder fails to appropriately
 execute and return the Contract Form and other documents within time specified, as required
 above, the Department may cancel the intent to award and keep the bid guaranty. The
 Department will then, in its discretion, award the Contract to the next lowest responsive and
 responsible bidder or readvertise the work.
 103-1.09 ORAL STATEMENTS. The written terms of the Contract are binding. No oral statement
 of any person shall, in any manner or degree, modify or otherwise affect, change, or amend the
 terms of the Contract.
 103-1.10 INTEGRATED CONTRACT. This Contract is an integrated document and contains the
 complete agreement and understanding of the parties. There are no unwritten agreements or
 understandings between the parties. Changes ordered or agreed upon, Directives given, or
 
 18

 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 104-1.01 INTENT OF CONTRACT. The intent of the Contract is to provide for the construction
 and completion of every detail of the described work. The Contractor shall furnish all labor,
 material, supervision, equipment, tools, transportation, supplies, and other resources required to
 complete the work in the time specified and in accordance with the Contract.
 The Contractor is responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequence, and procedures of
 construction, safety, and quality control, and is responsible to perform and furnish the work in
 accordance with the Contract documents.
 104-1.02 CHANGES.
 1. Within Contract Scope. The Engineer may order changes within the general scope of the
 Contract at any time, and without notice to sureties, including altering, ordering additions to,
 or ordering deletions of quantities of any item or portion of the work. These changes shall be
 made by a written Change Order and shall not invalidate the Contract or release the sureties.
 a. If the change does not materially differ in character or unit cost from specified Contract
 work, the Contractor shall perform the work at the original contract measurement
 methods and prices, subject to the provisions of Subsection 109-1.04.
 b. If the change is materially different in character or unit cost from that specified in the
 Contract, a new Contract Item will be established, and an equitable adjustment to
 Contract price and Contract time shall be calculated by one of the following methods:
 (1) The Engineer and Contractor agree upon an adjustment to Contract price and
 Contract time, and the Engineer issues a change order for the described work;
 (2) The Engineer requires the Contractor to proceed with the described work, with an
 adjustment to contract price and contract time, calculated by time and materials basis
 under Subsection 109-1.05, and the Engineer issues a change order for the work.
 The Contractor shall keep complete daily records of the cost of such work; or
 (3) The Engineer may issue a unilateral Change Order requiring the Contractor to
 proceed with the work with an adjustment to the payment amount or Contract
 time based on the Engineer's estimate of reasonable value. The Contractor shall
 keep complete daily records of the cost of such work.
 c.
 
 If the Engineer eliminates a Contract item, the Contractor shall accept compensation
 under Subsection 109-1.09.
 
 2. Outside Contract Scope. Changes determined to be outside the general scope of the
 Contract shall be made only by Supplemental Agreement issued in accordance with AS
 36.30 and the State’s procurement regulations. Additional bonding or insurance may be
 required.
 3. Cost and Pricing Data. Before a Change Order or Supplemental Agreement covering work for
 which there is no established Contract price will be approved, the Contractor shall submit
 detailed cost or pricing data regarding the changed work. The cost or pricing data shall
 include an itemization of production rates and all costs including labor, materials, and
 equipment required for the work. The Contractor shall certify that the data submitted are, to
 the best of its knowledge and belief, accurate, complete, and current as of a mutually agreed
 date and that the data will continue to be accurate and complete during the performance of
 the changed work.
 
 20
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 104
 
 104-1.03 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer
 in writing and specifically describe the alleged differing site condition if the Contractor discovers:
 1. Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site, differing materially from those shown in
 the Contract documents, that could not have been discovered by a careful examination of the
 site; or
 2. Unknown physical conditions at the site, of an unusual nature, differing materially from those
 ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided
 for in the Contract.
 Failure to give the Engineer immediate written notice of the alleged differing site condition as
 required under this section constitutes a waiver of any future claim arising from or relating to the
 alleged differing site condition.
 Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall leave the affected area
 undisturbed and suspend work in that area until the Engineer investigates the conditions.
 If the Engineer finds that such conditions differ materially and increase or decrease the cost of, or
 the time required for, performance of the Contract, the Engineer will prepare a Change Order for
 an Equitable Adjustment to the Contract. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Engineer’s
 preparation of the Change Order.
 If the Contractor and the Engineer are unable to reach an agreement concerning the alleged
 differing site condition, the Contractor may file a claim under Subsection 105-1.17.
 The Contractor shall keep accurate and detailed records of the actual cost of the work done as a
 result of the alleged differing site condition and shall allow the Engineer access to those records.
 Failure to keep records, to provide the Engineer with access to those records, or to give the
 notice required above will bar any recovery for the alleged differing site condition.
 104-1.04 USE OF MATERIALS FOUND ON THE WORK. Before using borrow, the Contractor
 shall utilize Useable Excavation to construct the selected material layers on the project. For the
 purposes of this subsection, Useable Excavation is material encountered in the excavation that
 meets the requirements of Subsection 703-2.07 Selected Material. For excavating the Useable
 Excavation and constructing the selected material layers with Useable Excavation, the Contractor
 shall be paid only the unit bid price for excavation. Hauling, placing, compacting and other
 activities required to construct the selected material layers with Useable Excavation shall be
 subsidiary to excavation, and the Contractor shall not be paid additional sums for those activities.
 The Engineer may approve the use of borrow when Useable Excavation is not available.
 The Engineer may authorize the Contractor to use the Useable Excavation for Contract items
 other than construction of the selected material layers on the project, and the Contractor shall be
 paid both for the excavation of the Useable Excavation and for the other Contract item for which it
 is acceptably used. If this action results in a shortage of material for the selected material layers:
 1. The Contractor shall replace Useable Excavation used for other Contract items on a yard for
 yard basis with borrow acceptable to the Engineer; and
 2. This replacement shall be at the Contractor's expense and at no additional cost to the
 Department. The Contractor shall pay any royalties required for the borrow.
 The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material that is within the right-of-way but
 outside the slope and grade lines described in the Contract, without written authorization from the
 Engineer.
 
 21
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 104
 
 In the event the Contractor has processed material from state-furnished sources in excess of the
 quantities required for performance of the Contract, the Department may retain possession of the
 surplus processed materials, including any unsuitable material produced as a by-product, without
 obligation to pay the Contractor for processing costs. When the surplus materials are in a
 stockpile, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to leave the materials in the stockpile, level the
 stockpile(s) or remove the materials and restore the premises to a satisfactory condition at no
 additional cost to the Department. This provision does not apply to material specifically produced
 under Section 305, Stockpiled Material.
 The Contractor may temporarily use material from a structure that is designated to be removed to
 erect a new structure, but shall not cut or otherwise damage such material without the Engineer's
 approval.
 104-1.05 CLEANUP. The Contractor shall remove all rubbish, temporary structures, excess
 materials, and equipment from the project site, from state owned materials sources, and from all
 work areas before project completion.
 104-1.06 VALUE ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS BY CONTRACTOR.
 1. Purpose and Scope. The purpose of this section is to encourage the Contractor to propose
 changes to Contract designs, materials, or methods based on the Contractor's experience
 and ingenuity. The Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECPs) contemplated are those
 that may result in immediate savings to the Department under this Contract without impairing
 essential functions and characteristics of the Project, including, but not limited to: service life,
 economy of operation, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, and safety. Cost savings
 on this project resulting from VECPs offered by the Contractor and accepted by the
 Department shall be shared equally between the Contractor and the Department.
 2. Submitting Proposals. All VECPs must be in writing.
 following with each VECP:
 
 The Contractor shall submit the
 
 a. A statement that the proposal is submitted as a VECP under Subsection 104-1.06;
 b. A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirements and the
 proposed change, stating the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each,
 including effects on service life, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, desired
 appearance, and safety;
 c.
 
 Drawings or specifications that show the proposed revisions relative to the original
 Contract requirements. The Contractor may submit schematics for conceptual approval of
 the proposal;
 
 d. A detailed and complete cost estimate comparing the original estimated costs for
 performing the work under the existing Contract and under the proposed VECP;
 e. A summary of the Contractor's development costs for the VECP, including costs for
 designing, testing, preparing and submitting the VECP;
 f.
 
 A description and estimate of added costs the Department may incur in implementing the
 VECP, such as review, testing and evaluation of the VECP and Contract administration
 costs;
 
 g. A date by which the Department must make a decision to obtain the cost savings
 projected in the VECP. The date identified must allow a reasonable time for the
 Department to conduct an adequate review and evaluation of the VECP and process a
 Change Order without affecting the Contractor’s schedule;
 
 22
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 104
 
 h. A statement of the probable effect the VECP would have on the Contract completion
 time. The Department's approval of the VECP shall not change the Contract completion
 date unless a change to the completion date is specifically provided for in the Change
 Order authorizing the VECP; and
 i.
 
 A description of any previous use or testing of the proposed change and the conditions
 and results. If the proposal was previously submitted on another Department project,
 indicate the date, project name and number, and the action taken by the Department.
 
 3. Conditions. VECPs will be considered only when all of the following conditions are met:
 a. The Contractor has not based any bid prices on the anticipated acceptance of a VECP. If
 the VECP is rejected, the Contractor shall complete the work at the Contract prices.
 b. VECPs, regardless of their approval status, become the property of the Department. The
 Contractor shall submit VECPs without use or disclosure restrictions. The Department
 shall have the right to use, duplicate or disclose the VECP and any data necessary to use
 the VECP on the Project, on any other project, and on any other Contracts. The
 Contractor shall identify any trade secret information, patented materials or proprietary
 processes that restrict use of the VECP.
 c.
 
 The Department is the sole judge as to whether a VECP qualifies for consideration and
 evaluation. It may reject any VECP that does not allow a reasonable time for adequate
 review and evaluation by the Department or that requires excessive time or costs for
 review, evaluations, or investigations, or which is not consistent with the Department's
 design standards and policies, safety considerations, land use restrictions, permit
 stipulations, right-of way limitations, or other essential criteria for the project. The
 Department may reject a VECP without obligation to the Contractor if it contains
 proposals that are already under consideration by the Department or that have already
 been authorized for the Contract.
 
 d. If additional information is needed to evaluate a VECP, the Contractor shall provide it in a
 timely manner. Failure to do so may result in rejection of the VECP.
 e. The Contractor may submit VECPs for an approved subcontractor if the Department
 makes reimbursement to the Contractor.
 f.
 
 If the Contractor hires a design professional to prepare the proposal, they must be
 registered in the State of Alaska. That professional must seal the documents and provide
 evidence of Professional Liability Insurance with limits acceptable to the Department.
 
 g. The Contractor shall not implement proposed changes before the Department accepts
 the VECP.
 h. The Department shall not consider VECPs to share in cost savings due to changes
 previously ordered or authorized under other Contract sections or for work already done.
 i.
 
 The Engineer shall reject all unsatisfactory work resulting from an accepted VECP. The
 Contractor shall remove all rejected work or materials, and shall reconstruct the work
 under the original Contract at the Contractor's sole expense under Subsection 105-1.11.
 
 j.
 
 Reimbursement for modifications to the VECP to adjust field or other conditions is limited
 to the total amount of the original Contract bid prices.
 
 k.
 
 The Department shall not be held liable for costs or delays due to the rejection of a
 VECP, including but not limited to the Contractor's development costs, loss of anticipated
 profits and increased material, labor or overhead costs.
 23
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 104
 
 4. Processing.
 a. The Engineer shall accept or reject the VECP, in writing, by the date the Contractor
 specifies, unless extended by mutual consent. If rejected, the Engineer will explain the
 reasons for rejection. A VECP may be rejected if the Contractor allows the Department
 insufficient time to adequately review and evaluate it.
 b. The Contractor may withdraw or modify a VECP at any time before it is accepted.
 c.
 
 If the VECP is approved in concept (without final drawings and specifications), the
 Department may either undertake the re-design itself or issue the Contractor a limited
 notice to proceed, subject to mutual agreement, authorizing the final design. The notice
 to proceed will include reference to any pertinent design criteria, Department policies,
 and other limitations on the design or construction methods. Approval in concept does
 not constitute acceptance of the VECP and will not obligate the Department to accept or
 pay for the final design.
 
 d. If the final VECP is accepted, the Engineer will issue a Change Order under Subsection
 104-1.02 incorporating the VECP into the Contract.
 5. Payment. If the Department accepts the VECP, payment will be authorized as follows:
 a. The Department will make a direct payment for the changed work at the unit or lump sum
 agreed prices in the Change Order. Such prices will include reimbursement of the
 Contractor's costs to develop and submit the VECP, including overhead and profit.
 b. In addition, the Department will share the net savings with the Contractor in a separate
 lump sum contract item, VECP Incentive, Item 104(1). The amount of the VECP incentive
 will be equal to 50 percent of the net savings to the Department. The net savings are the
 difference between the original Contract price for the affected work and the cost of the
 revised work. For the purpose of this calculation, the cost of the revised work will include
 costs the Department may incur as a result of the VECP, such as review of the proposal,
 testing and evaluation, and added Contract administration costs. These costs will be
 estimated and agreed to in the Change Order.
 c.
 
 The VECP Incentive, Item 104(1), will be paid on a prorated basis as the revised work is
 performed.

 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 105-1.01 AUTHORITY OF THE ENGINEER. The Engineer has immediate charge of the
 engineering details of the project and is responsible for Contract administration. The Engineer
 has authority to reject defective material and suspend work being performed improperly. The
 Engineer has authority to accept completed work, issue Directives, issue Interim Work
 Authorizations, issue Change Orders, and recommend Contract payments.
 The Engineer will decide all questions about the quality and acceptability of the materials
 furnished and the work performed by the Contractor, the Contractor’s rate of progress, Contract
 interpretation and all other questions relating to Contract performance.
 The Engineer has authority to suspend work for reasons listed under Subsection 108-1.06. If the
 suspension is to protect workers or the public from imminent harm, the Engineer may orally order
 the suspension of work. Following an oral order of suspension, the Engineer will promptly give
 written notice of suspension. In other circumstances, the Engineer will give the Contractor written
 notice of suspension before suspension of work. A notice of suspension will state the defects or
 reasons for a suspension, the corrective actions required to stop suspension, and the time
 allowed to complete corrective actions. If the Contractor fails to take the corrective action within
 the specified time, the Engineer may:
 1. Suspend the work until it is corrected; and
 2. Employ others to correct the condition and deduct the cost from the Contract amount.
 The Engineer may, at reasonable times, inspect any part of the plant or place of business of the
 Contractor or any subcontractor that is related to Contract performance, including private or
 commercial plants, shops, offices, or other places of business.
 The Engineer may audit all books and records related to performance of the Contract, whether
 kept by the Contractor or a subcontractor, including cost or pricing data submitted under
 Subsection 104-1.02.
 105-1.02 PLANS AND WORKING DRAWINGS. The Department shall provide the Contractor at
 least two full size sets of the conformed Plans and Contract including Special Provisions. If crosssections are available, one set will be provided if requested in writing by the Contractor. The
 Contractor shall keep a complete set of these documents available on the project site at all times.
 The Contractor shall supplement structure plans with working drawings that include all details that
 may be required to adequately control the work and that are not included in the Plans furnished
 by the Department. The Contractor shall not perform work or order materials until the working
 drawings for such work, or for changes, are approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval of any required preliminary detail or
 working drawings. The project name and number shall be stated in the title block for all drawings,
 as shall the state bridge number, when applicable. The Contractor shall submit drawings in either
 an electronic or paper format that is acceptable to the Engineer. When paper copies are
 submitted, provide three sets.
 The Contractor shall submit drawings to the Engineer in time to allow for review and correction
 before beginning the work detailed in the drawing. The Engineer shall return one set of these
 drawings, either approved or marked with corrections to be made, and shall retain the other sets.
 The Engineer's approval of working drawings does not change the Contract requirements or
 release the Contractor of the responsibility for successful completion of the work.
 
 25
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy of dimensions and details and for conformity of the
 working drawings with the Plans and Specifications. The Contractor shall indicate clearly on the
 working drawings any intended deviations from the Plans and Specifications and itemize and
 explain each deviation in the Contractor's transmittal letter. The Engineer may order the
 Contractor to comply with the Plans and Specifications at the Contractor's sole expense if the
 approved working drawings deviate from the Plans and Specifications and the Contractor failed to
 itemize and explain the deviations in the Contractor's transmittal letter.
 Once the Contractor receives approval of the working drawings, the Contractor shall furnish to the
 Engineer:
 1. Enough additional copies to provide eight approved sets of prints;
 2. One set of reproducible transparencies (polyester film); and
 3. If requested, an electronic file in AutoCAD drawing interchange format (.DXF).
 The Contractor shall include the cost of furnishing all working drawings in the Contract price.
 105-1.03 CONFORMITY WITH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS. Work performed and materials
 furnished shall conform to the Plans and Specifications and approved Working Drawings and be
 within specified tolerances. When tolerances are not specified, the Engineer will determine the
 limits allowed in each case.
 All work or material not conforming to the Plans and Specifications and approved Working
 Drawings is considered unacceptable unless the Engineer finds that reasonably acceptable work
 has been produced. In this event, the Engineer may allow non-conforming work or material to
 remain in place, but at a reduced price. The Engineer will document the basis of acceptance and
 payment by Change Order, unless the contract specifies a method to adjust the price of that item.
 The failure of the Department to strictly enforce the Contract in one or more instances does not
 waive its right to do so in other or future instances.
 105-1.04 COORDINATION OF PLANS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
 These Standard Specifications, the Standard Drawings, Standard Modifications, Plans, Special
 Provisions, and all supplementary documents are essential parts of the Contract. They are
 intended to complement each other and describe and provide for a complete project. A
 requirement occurring in one is as binding as if occurring in all.
 In case of conflict, calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions. In the event that
 any of the following listed contract documents conflict with another listed contract document, the
 order of precedence is:
 1. Special Provisions
 2. Plans
 3. Standard Modifications
 4. Standard Specifications
 5. Standard Drawings
 The Contractor shall not take advantage of any apparent error or omission in the Contract
 documents. The Contractor may not base a claim for additional compensation or Contract time
 on a patent error, omission, or conflict in the Contract documents. The Contractor shall notify the
 
 26
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 Engineer immediately of any apparent errors or omissions in the Contract documents. The
 Engineer will make any corrections or interpretations necessary to fulfill the intent of the Contract.
 105-1.05 COOPERATION BY CONTRACTOR. The Contractor shall give the work the constant
 attention necessary for its progress, and shall cooperate fully with the Engineer, Department staff,
 and other contractors in every way possible.
 Either the Contractor’s Superintendent or an acting Superintendent with authority to represent
 and act for the Contractor shall be available within the proximity of the project whenever work is
 occurring. The Contractor shall employ, as its agent, a competent superintendent thoroughly
 experienced in the type of work being performed and capable of reading and thoroughly
 understanding the Plans and Specifications. The Contractor shall provide 24-hour contact
 information for the Superintendent. The Contractor shall ensure that the superintendent is
 available at all times to receive and execute Directives and other instructions from the Engineer,
 to supervise workers and to coordinate the work of subcontractors. The Contractor shall give the
 superintendent full authority to supply the resources required. The Contractor shall furnish
 superintendence regardless of the amount of work sublet.
 105-1.06 UTILITIES.
 1. Bid Considerations. Bidders shall include in their bid the cost of:
 a. All utility work that is specified in the Contract as work to be performed by the Contractor;
 b. Working around or through all permanent and temporary utilities shown on the Plans, in
 both their present and adjusted positions;
 c.
 
 Accommodating the removal, adjustment, or relocation of utilities shown on the Plans by
 entities other than the Contractor;
 
 d. Construction and removal of temporary utilities, to provide temporary utility service during
 the construction or repair of a permanent utility; and
 e. Other utility work not specifically identified as compensable in Subparagraph 4
 Compensation.
 The Department will show the approximate locations of utilities it knows to be within the work
 zone on the Plans. Bidders shall expect that the location, elevation and nature of utilities may
 vary from what is shown on the Plans and shall factor those contingencies into the bid price.
 Additional utilities may exist that are not shown on the Plans. Compensation related to utilities
 not shown on the plans will only be available in accordance with Subparagraph 4
 Compensation.
 When an entity other than the Contractor is to remove, adjust, or relocate any utility, or
 perform other utility related work within the project boundaries, the applicable completion
 dates or specific calendar days to complete the removal, adjustment, relocation, or other
 utility related work may be stated in Section 651. If no date is stated, the Contractor shall
 work cooperatively with the utility owner during the Project.
 2. Cooperation with Utility Owners. The Contractor assumes the obligation of coordinating their
 activities with utility owners, and shall cooperate with utility owners to facilitate removal,
 adjustment, or relocation operations, avoid duplication of work, and prevent unnecessary
 interruption of services. When a utility owner is identified in the Contract as being responsible
 for removing, adjusting, or relocating a utility, the Contractor shall give the utility owner 15
 days advance written notice regarding the dates when the utility owner is required to begin
 and end operations.
 
 27
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 The Contractor shall cooperate with utility owners to determine a utility progress schedule for
 all parties’ utility work. The Contractor shall submit the schedule to the Engineer before
 beginning that portion of utility work. The Contractor shall update the utility progress schedule
 monthly and shall note time delays and their cause.
 Utility owners are not required to work in more than one location at a time, and shall be
 allowed to complete a specific section of work prior to commencing another section. Utility
 owners will not normally perform adjustment or relocation of underground utilities when the
 ground is frozen. Utility owners may prohibit the Contractor, through the Engineer, from
 working near utilities when the ground is frozen.
 The Department has sole discretion to grant permits for utility work within the state right-ofway. The Contractor shall allow parties with utility permits to work and make excavations in
 the project.
 If utility owners do not complete their work in a timely manner, the Engineer may direct the
 Contractor to temporarily relocate the utilities, to construct new utilities, or to make necessary
 repairs to complete the utility work.
 3. Utility Work. The Contractor shall:
 a. Make all necessary arrangements with utility owners to locate all utilities that may be
 within an area of work before excavation in that area, in accordance with AS 42.30.400;
 b. Provide right-of-way staking and construction staking with lines and grades before
 excavation in that area;
 c.
 
 Prevent damage to utilities or utility property within or adjacent to the project;
 
 d. Carefully uncover utilities where they intersect the work;

 work and the utility companies’ work.
 
 4. Compensation.
 a. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Subparagraph 4, no equitable
 adjustment will be paid by the Department:
 (1) Due to any variations in location, elevation, and nature of utilities shown on the Plans,
 or the operation of removing, adjusting, or relocating them;
 (2) For any delays, inconvenience, or damage sustained as a result of interference from
 utility owners, interference from utilities, or interference from the operation of
 removing, adjusting, or relocating utilities; or
 (3) For any adjustments or relocations of utilities requested for the Contractor’s
 convenience.
 b. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Subparagraph 4, the Engineer will issue
 a Change Order with equitable adjustment if:
 (1) Utilities not shown on the Plans require removal, adjustment, or relocation;
 (2) Conflicts occur between utilities not shown on the Plans and other necessary work; or
 (3) Conflicts due to the required elevation of a utility occur between new and existing
 utilities that are both shown on the Plans.
 c.
 
 When the Contractor damages utilities, the utility owner may choose to repair the
 damage or require the Contractor to repair the damage. When the Contractor damages
 utilities:
 (1) No equitable adjustment will be paid by the Department, and the Contractor shall be
 solely responsible for repair costs and expenses, when:
 (a) The Contractor failed to obtain field locates before performing the work that
 resulted in the damage;
 (b) The utility was field located by the utility owner or operator, and the field locate is
 accurate within 24 horizontal inches if the utility is buried 10 feet deep or less, or
 the field locate is accurate within 30 horizontal inches if the utility is buried
 deeper than 10 feet;
 29
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 (c) The plan profile or the field locate does not indicate or inaccurately indicates the
 elevation of a buried utility;
 (d) The utility is visible in the field; or
 (e) The Contractor could otherwise reasonably have been aware of the utility.
 (2) The Engineer will issue a Change Order with an equitable adjustment for the cost of
 repairing damage if:
 (a) The field locate by the owner or operator of a buried utility erred by more than 24
 horizontal inches if the utility is buried 10 feet deep or less, or 30 horizontal
 inches if the utility is buried deeper than 10 feet;
 (b) The utility was not shown on the Plans or other Contract documents, and the
 Contractor could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the utility’s
 existence; or
 (c) The Contractor made a written request for a field locate in accordance with AS
 42.30.400, the utility owner did not locate the utility in accordance with AS
 42.30.410, and the Contractor could not reasonably have been expected to be
 aware of the utility’s existence or location.
 d. If a delay is caused by a utility owner, is beyond the control of the Contractor, and is not
 the result of the Contractor’s fault or negligence, the Engineer may issue a Change Order
 with an equitable adjustment to contract time, but no equitable adjustment will be made
 for the cost of delay, inconvenience or damage. Additional contract time may be granted
 if the cause of delay is because a utility owner is to perform utility work:
 (1) By dates stated in the Special Provisions, and the utility work is not completed by the
 dates stated; or
 (2) In cooperation with the Contractor, and the utility owner does not complete the work
 in a timely manner, based on a written progress schedule agreed upon by the
 Contractor and the utility owner.
 e. If the Engineer orders the Contractor to make necessary construction or repairs due to
 incomplete utility work by utility owners, the Contractor will be paid as specifically
 provided for in the Contract, or the Engineer will issue a Change Order with equitable
 adjustment.
 105-1.07 COOPERATION BETWEEN CONTRACTORS. The Department may, at any time,
 contract for and perform other or additional work on or near the Project. The Contractor shall
 allow other contractors reasonable access across or through the Project.
 The Contractor shall cooperate with other contractors working on or near the Project, and shall
 conduct work without interrupting or inhibiting the work of other contractors. All contractors
 working on or near the Project shall accept all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with
 their Contract. No claim shall be made by the Contractor or paid by the Department for any
 inconvenience, delay, damage or loss of any kind to the Contractor due to the presence or work
 of other contractors working on or near the Project.
 The Contractor shall coordinate and sequence the work with other contractors working within the
 same project limits. The Contractor shall properly join the work with work performed by other
 contractors and shall perform the work in the proper sequence to that of the others. The
 Contractor shall arrange, place, and dispose of materials without interfering with the operations of
 other contractors on the same project. The Contractor shall defend, indemnify and save harmless
 30
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 the Department from any damages or claims caused by inconvenience, delay, or loss that the
 Contractor causes to other contractors.
 105-1.08 SURVEY CONTROL. The Department will provide sufficient horizontal and vertical
 control data to establish the planned lines, grades, shapes, and structures. The Contractor shall
 provide all additional survey work to maintain control during the project.
 105-1.09 DUTIES OF THE INSPECTOR. The Department’s inspectors are authorized to examine
 all work done and materials furnished, but cannot approve work or materials. Only the Engineer
 can approve work or materials. The inspectors can reject work or materials until any issues can
 be referred to and decided by the Engineer. The inspectors may not alter or waive any Contract
 requirements, issue instructions contrary to the Contract or act as foremen for the Contractor.
 105-1.10 INSPECTION OF WORK. All materials and each part and detail of the work shall be
 subject to inspection by the Department. The Contractor shall allow safe access to all parts of the
 work and provide information and assistance to the Engineer to ensure a complete and detailed
 inspection.
 Any work done or materials used without inspection by an authorized Department representative
 may be ordered removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense, unless the Department failed
 to inspect after being given reasonable written notice that the work was to be performed.
 The Contractor shall remove and uncover portions of finished work when directed. After
 inspection, the Contractor shall restore the work to Contract requirements. The cost to uncover
 and restore work shall be at the Contractor’s expense, except the Department will pay the cost to
 uncover and restore work if (1) an authorized Department representative had previously
 inspected the work or the Contractor had provided reasonable prior written notice that the work
 was to be performed and (2) the Department finds the uncovered work to be acceptable. If the
 Department finds the uncovered work to be unacceptable, the cost to correct the work, or remove
 and replace the work, shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 Representatives of Contract funding agencies have the right to inspect the work. This right does
 not make that entity a party to the Contract and does not interfere with the rights of parties to the
 Contract.
 The Department's observations, inspections, tests and approvals shall not relieve the Contractor
 from properly fulfilling its Contract obligations and performing the work in accordance with the
 Contract. Work that has been inspected but contains latent or hidden defects shall not be deemed
 acceptable even though it has been inspected and found to be in accordance with the Contract.
 105-1.11 REMOVAL OF UNACCEPTABLE AND UNAUTHORIZED WORK. All work that does
 not conform to the requirements of the Contract shall be deemed unacceptable by the Engineer,
 unless otherwise determined acceptable under Subsection 105–1.03. The Contractor shall
 correct, or remove and replace, work or material that the Engineer deems unacceptable, as
 ordered by the Engineer and at no additional cost to the Department.
 The Contractor shall establish necessary lines and grades before performing work. Work done
 before necessary lines and grades are established, work done contrary to the Department's
 instructions, work done beyond the limits shown in the Contract, or any extra work done without
 authority, will be considered as unauthorized and shall not be paid for by the Department, and
 may be ordered removed or replaced at no additional cost to the Department.
 If the Contractor fails to promptly correct, remove, or replace unacceptable or unauthorized work
 as ordered by the Engineer, the Engineer may employ others to remedy or remove and replace
 the work and will deduct the cost from the Contract payment.
 
 31
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 105-1.12 LOAD RESTRICTIONS. The Contractor shall comply with all vehicle legal size and
 weight regulations of 17 AAC 25 and the Administrative Permit Manual, and shall obtain permits
 from the DOT&PF Division of Measurement Standards & Commercial Vehicle Enforcement
 before moving oversize or overweight equipment on a state highway.
 The Engineer may permit oversize and overweight vehicle movements within the project limits
 provided the Contractor submits a written request and an acceptable Traffic Control Plan under
 Subsection 643-1.03. No overloads will be permitted on a pavement, base or structure that will
 remain in place in the completed project. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage done
 by their equipment due to overloads, and for damage done by a load placed on a material that is
 curing and has not reached adequate strength to support the load.
 105-1.13 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION. The Contractor shall maintain the entire
 highway and related highway facilities located within the project (between the beginning of project
 and end of project shown on the Plans) from the date construction begins until the Contractor
 receives a letter of project completion. The Contractor shall maintain these areas continually and
 effectively on a daily basis, with adequate resources to keep them in satisfactory condition at all
 times. The Contractor shall maintain those areas outside the project that are affected by the
 work, such as haul routes, detour routes, structures, material sites, and equipment storage sites
 during periods of their use.
 The Engineer may relieve the Contractor of this maintenance responsibility for specified portions
 of the project for any of the following:
 1. During a seasonal suspension of work (Subsection 643-3.07)
 2. Following partial completion (Subsection 105-1.14)
 3. Following substantial completion (Subsection 105-1.15).
 The Department is responsible for routine snow removal and ice control only on those portions of
 the project that the Department accepts for maintenance and that are open for public use.
 The Contractor shall maintain previously constructed work until a subsequent course, layer, or
 structure covers that work. The Contractor shall repair damage done to the work as described in
 Subsection 107-1.15.
 All costs of maintenance work shall be subsidiary to the prices bid on the various contract items,
 and the Contractor will not be paid an additional amount for such work.
 If in the Engineer’s opinion, the Contractor at any time fails to provide adequate maintenance, the
 Engineer will notify the Contractor of such noncompliance. The notification will specify the areas
 or structures for which there is inadequate maintenance, the corrective maintenance required,
 and the time allowed to complete corrective maintenance. If the Contractor fails to take the
 corrective action within the specified time, the Engineer may:
 1. Suspend the work until corrective maintenance is completed;
 2. Assess a traffic price adjustment against the Contract Amount when an adjustment rate is
 specified in the Contract; and
 3. Employ others for corrective maintenance and deduct the cost from the Contract amount.
 105-1.14 PARTIAL COMPLETION. The Contractor may submit a written request for partial
 acceptance of a substantially complete geographically separate portion of the project. The
 Engineer will accept the portion in writing before project completion and relieve the Contractor of
 further maintenance responsibility for the completed work except as listed under Subsection 62132
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 3.04 Period of Establishment if the Engineer inspects the portion and finds that it is substantially
 complete to Contract requirements, and acceptance is in the best interest of the State.
 Partial completion of the portion neither voids nor alters any Contract terms.
 105-1.15 PROJECT COMPLETION. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer, in writing, upon
 substantial completion of all work provided for under the Contract. The Engineer will then
 schedule and conduct the final inspection. If the inspection discloses that any work is incomplete
 or unsatisfactory, the Engineer will give the Contractor a list of work items that must be completed
 or corrected to reach substantial completion and to reach final completion. The Contractor shall
 promptly complete or correct any work determined unsatisfactory by the final inspection and
 request a re-inspection.
 The Engineer will identify the date of substantial completion in a letter of substantial completion.
 The letter of substantial completion will relieve the Contractor of further maintenance
 responsibility of the completed work. The letter of substantial completion will not stop Contract
 time or relieve the Contractor of the obligation to fully complete the work as required by the
 Contract specifications.
 When all physical work and cleanup provided for under the Contract is found to be complete,
 except for work specified under Subsection 621-3.04 Period of Establishment, the Engineer will
 issue a letter of project completion. Project completion stops the Contract time, but does not
 relieve the Contractor of any other Contract obligations.
 105-1.16 FINAL ACCEPTANCE AND RECORD RETENTION. The Department will issue the
 letter of Final Acceptance after all of the following:
 1. Project completion;
 2. Receipt of all certificates, as-builts, warranties, and other required documents;
 3. Receipt of the Contractor's Release, with no exceptions;
 4. Certification of payment of payroll and revenue taxes by DOLWD and State Department of
 Revenue; and
 5. Final payment under the Contract.
 Final Acceptance will release the Contractor from further Contract obligations, except those:
 1. Specified under Subsection 107-1.19;
 2. Required by law or regulation; or
 3. Continuing obligations established by provisions of this Contract, such as warranty, guaranty,
 indemnity, insurance, or bond.
 The Contractor and the subcontractors shall maintain all books and records relating to
 performance of the Contract for three years after the date of final payment of the Contract and
 each subcontract.
 105-1.17 CLAIMS. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer as soon as the Contractor becomes
 aware of any act or occurrence that may form the basis of a claim for additional compensation or
 an extension of Contract time or of any dispute regarding a question of fact or interpretation of the
 Contract. The Engineer has no obligation to investigate any fact or occurrence that might form the
 basis of a claim or to provide any additional compensation or extension of Contract time unless
 
 33
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 the Contractor notifies the Engineer in a timely manner of all facts the Contractor believes form
 the basis for the claim.
 If the Contractor believes that he is entitled to an extension of Contract time, the Contractor must
 state the contract section on which the extension request is based, provide the Engineer with
 sufficient information to demonstrate that the Contractor has suffered excusable delay, and show
 the specific amount of time to which the Contractor is claiming entitlement. The Department will
 not grant and extension Contract time if the Contractor does not timely submit revised schedules
 in accordance with Subsection 108-1.03.
 If the basis of claim or dispute is not resolved by agreement within seven days of the date the
 Engineer is notified by the Contractor, the Contractor shall within the next fourteen days submit a
 Contractor Intent to Claim (Form 25D-18) to the Engineer. Failure to submit a Contractor Intent to
 Claim as required under this section constitutes a waiver of any future claim arising from or
 relating to the alleged act or occurrence.
 If the Contractor believes additional compensation or time is warranted, the Contractor shall
 immediately begin keeping complete, accurate, and specific daily records concerning every detail
 of the potential claim including actual costs incurred, and shall give the Engineer access to any
 such records and furnish the Engineer copies, if requested. Equipment costs must be based on
 the Contractor's internal rates for ownership, depreciation, and operating expenses and not on
 published rental rates. In computing damages, or costs claimed for a change order, or for any
 other claim against the Department for additional time, compensation or both, the contractor must
 establish actual damages based on internal costs for equipment, labor or efficiencies. Total cost,
 modified total cost or jury verdict forms of presentation of damage claims are not permitted.
 Labor inefficiencies must be shown to actually have occurred and can be proven solely based on
 job records. Theoretical studies are not a permissible means of showing labor inefficiencies.
 Home office overhead will not be allowed as a component of any claim against the Department.
 The Contractor shall submit a written claim to the Contracting Officer within 90 days after the date
 the Contractor became aware of the basis of the claim or should have known of the basis of the
 claim, whichever is earlier. The Contracting Officer will issue written acknowledgement of the
 receipt of the claim.
 The Contractor waives any right to claim if the Engineer was not notified properly or afforded the
 opportunity to inspect conditions or monitor actual costs or if the Claim is not filed on the date
 required.
 1. The written Claim must include all of the following:
 a. The act, event, or condition giving rise to the claim;
 b. The Contract provisions that apply to the claim and that provide for the requested relief;
 c.
 
 The item or items of Contract work affected and how they were affected;
 
 d. The specific relief requested, including Contract time if applicable, and the basis upon
 which it was calculated;
 e. Revised progress schedules under Subsection 108–1.03; and
 f.
 
 A certification signed by the Contractor that to the best of the contractor's knowledge and
 belief, the data submitted is accurate, complete, and current and is the actual cost to the
 contractor or additional time for performing the additional work or supplying the additional
 materials.
 
 2. The claim, in order to be considered, must show:
 34
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 105
 
 a. That the Contractor suffered damages or delay;
 b. The damages or delay were caused by the act, event, or condition listed in the claim; and
 c.
 
 That the Contract entitled the Contractor for relief due to the act, event, or condition
 specified in the Claim.
 
 The Department may request the Contractor to provide additional information relating to the claim
 at any time before issuing a decision. The Contractor shall provide the Department with the
 requested additional information within 30 days of receiving a request. Failure to furnish the
 additional information may be regarded as a waiver of the claim.
 The Contracting Officer will issue a decision within 90 days of receipt of all information relating to
 the claim. The time for the Contracting Officer to issue a decision may be extended in
 accordance with AS 36.30.620.
 The Contracting Officer's decision is final and conclusive unless the Contractor delivers a notice
 of appeal to the Commissioner within 14 days of receipt of the decision. The Contractor shall also
 serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the Contracting Officer.
 Appeals from a Contracting Officer’s decision shall be decided in accordance with the State
 Procurement Code’s appeal procedures, including AS 36.30.625, AS 36.30.627, AS 36.30.630,
 and AS 36.30.631.
 Criminal and civil penalties authorized under AS 36.30.687 (including, but not limited to, forfeiture
 of all claimed amounts) may be imposed on the Contractor if the Contractor makes or uses a
 misrepresentation in support of a claim, or defrauds or attempts to defraud the Department at any
 stage of prosecuting a claim under this Contract.

 CONTROL OF MATERIAL
 106-1.01 SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. The Contractor shall furnish all
 materials required to complete the work except those specified to be furnished by the Department. The
 Contractor shall supply materials that are new and that meet Contract requirements.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer of proposed sources of materials at least 30 days before
 shipment, and shall submit to the Engineer and to the Department's State Materials Engineer a complete
 list of materials to be purchased from suppliers sufficiently in advance of fabrication or shipment to permit
 the Department to inspect the materials.
 The Department’s inspectors may inspect any materials, including those originating outside Alaska, at the
 supply source or other locations. Materials may be conditionally approved at the supply source or other
 location, but are subject to field inspection and may be ordered removed under Subsection 105-1.11 if
 they do not conform to Contract requirements. Inspectors are authorized to reject materials that do not
 conform to specifications. Inspectors will report their actions to the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall submit a certificate of compliance for each item listed on the Material Certification
 List. The Engineer may authorize the use of materials based on a certificate of compliance, see
 Subsection 106-1.05. Materials incorporated into the project on the basis of a certificate of compliance
 may be tested at any time, whether in place or not, and, if they do not conform to Contract specifications,
 they may be rejected and ordered removed under Subsection 105-1.11.
 The Engineer may authorize the use of materials listed in the Department's Qualified Products List.
 Materials incorporated into the project on the basis of the Qualified Products List may be tested at any
 time, whether in place or not, and, if they do not conform to Contract specifications, they may be rejected
 and ordered removed under Subsection 105-1.11.
 The Contractor may request substitution of specified materials with equivalent materials. Requests for
 substitution shall be submitted to the Engineer, and shall include a manufacturer's statement that certifies,
 for each lot delivered:
 1. Conformance to the specified performance, testing, quality or dimensional requirements; and
 2. Suitability for the use intended in the Contract work.
 The Engineer will determine the acceptability of a proposed substitute for use in the project. If a substitute
 is approved, a Change Order will be executed. The Department is never required to accept substitution.
 The Contractor shall not incorporate substitute materials into the project without written approval from the
 Engineer. The Engineer may test substitute materials at any time, whether in place or not, and, if the
 substitute materials do not meet Contract specifications, they may be rejected and ordered removed
 under Subsection 105-1.11.
 BUY AMERICA PROVISION. On projects using federal funds, the Contractor shall comply with the
 requirements of 23 CFR 635.410, Buy America requirements, and shall submit a completed Material
 Origin Certificate, Form 25D-60, prior to award of the contract. When the Contractor becomes aware of a
 change from or error in a previously submitted Material Origin Certificate (Form 25D-60), the Contractor
 shall submit an updated Material Origin Certificate (Form 25D-60). All steel and iron products which are
 incorporated into the work, shall be manufactured in the United States except that minor amounts of steel
 and iron products of foreign manufacture may be used, provided the aggregate cost of such does not
 exceed one tenth of one percent (0.001) of the total contract amount, or $2,500, whichever is greater. For
 the purposes of this paragraph, the cost is the value of the products as they are delivered to the project
 including freight.
 “Manufactured in the United States” means all manufacturing processes starting with the initial mixing and
 melting through the final shaping, welding, and coating processes must be undertaken in the United
 
 36
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 States. The definition of “manufacturing process” is smelting or any subsequent process that alters the
 material’s physical form, shape or chemical composition. These processes include rolling, extruding,
 machining, bending, grinding, drilling, etc. The application of coatings, such as epoxy coating,
 galvanizing, painting or any other coating that protects or enhances the value of steel or iron materials
 shall also be considered a manufacturing process subject to the requirements of Section 106-1.01, Buy
 America Provision and of the Buy America Act.
 Buy America does not apply to raw materials (iron ore), pig iron, and processed, pelletized and reduced
 iron ore. It also does not apply to temporary steel items (e.g., temporary sheet piling, temporary bridges,
 steel scaffolding, and falsework). Further, it does not apply to materials which remain in place at the
 Contractor’s convenience (e.g., sheet pilings, and forms).
 The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) does not apply to the Buy America requirement.
 There is a specific exemption within NAFTA (article 1001) for grant programs such as the Federal-aid
 highway program.
 When steel and iron products manufactured in the United States are shipped to a foreign country where
 non steel or iron products are installed on or in them (e.g., electronic components in a steel cabinet), the
 steel and iron is considered to meet the requirements of this subsection.
 The Contractor shall ensure that all manufacturing processes for each covered product comply with this
 provision. Non-conforming products shall be replaced at no expense to the State. Failure to comply may
 also subject the Contractor to default and debarment.
 Provide a Certificate of Buy America Act Compliance Form 25D-62 from the supplier for each steel or iron
 product and each component that is manufactured predominantly of steel or iron, prior to incorporating
 any steel or iron products or any components manufactured predominantly of steel or iron into the project.
 The supplier certifying Form 25D-62 may be the original manufacturer, fabricator, vendor, or
 subcontractor; provided the supplier has sufficient control and knowledge of the manufacturing process to
 accept responsibility and certify full and complete conformance with 23 CFR 635.410. Provide mill
 certificates when required by the Engineer. False statements may result in criminal penalties prescribed
 under AS 36.30.687 and Title 18 US Code Section 1001 and 1020.
 ALASKA AGRICULTURAL/WOOD PRODUCTS. On wholly state-funded projects, agricultural/wood
 products harvested in Alaska shall be used pursuant to AS 36.15.050 and AS 36.30.322 whenever they
 are priced no more than seven percent above agricultural/wood products harvested outside the state and
 are of a like quality as compared with agricultural/wood products harvested outside the state.
 The Contractor shall maintain records which establish the type and extent of agricultural/wood products
 utilized. When such products are not utilized, the Contractor shall document the efforts he made towards
 obtaining agricultural/wood products harvested in Alaska and include in this documentation a written
 statement that he contacted the manufacturers and suppliers identified on the Department of Commerce
 and Economic Development's list of suppliers of Alaska forest products concerning the availability of
 agricultural/wood products harvested in Alaska and, if available, the product prices. The Contractor shall
 complete this documentation at a time determined by the Contracting Officer.
 The Contractor's use of agricultural/wood products that fail to meet the requirements of this Subsection
 shall be removed and replaced in accordance with the last paragraph of Subsection 105-1.03, Conformity
 With Plans and Specifications.
 106-1.02 MATERIAL SOURCES.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall:
 
 37
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 a. utilize Useable Excavation according to Subsection 104-1.04 before using material sources listed
 in Subsection 106-1.02.4. When there is insufficient useable excavation furnish additional
 required materials from sources of the Contractor’s choice, except that the Contractor shall use a
 mandatory source when identified in the Contract;
 b. produce a sufficient quantity of materials meeting the specifications to complete the project;
 c.
 
 as a subsidiary cost: clear and grub, strip, drill and blast, excavate, crush, sort, blend, screen,
 wash, stockpile, haul, and rehandle material as needed to produce and deliver the specified
 product;
 
 d. determine the type of equipment and methods to be used;
 e. expect variations in material quality within the deposits, and procure material only from
 acceptable portions of the deposit, regardless of source ownership; and
 f.
 
 prevent erosion, sedimentation, and pollution within a materials source.
 
 The Contractor agrees that:
 g. the costs to explore and develop material sources, including all production effort, are subsidiary to
 the cost of providing the specified material;
 h. the Engineer may order the Contractor to procure material only from certain portions of the
 source and may reject material from other portions of the source that does not conform to the
 specifications; and.
 i.
 
 all material required may not be procurable from any one source and the Contractor may need to
 change between sources. That contingency is to be factored into the unit bid price for the
 Contract Item.
 
 2. Inspection and Acceptance. The Contractor shall perform sampling and testing during materials
 processing and placement in accordance with its Quality Control Plan (Subsection 106-1.03, Testing
 and Acceptance) and shall obtain acceptable material samples from locations designated within the
 source.
 The Department will sample and test materials to determine the quality of the source, at its expense,
 as part of its Acceptance Testing (106-1.03.2). The Department will reject materials when the
 samples do not meet specifications. The Department may reject a proposed materials site when
 samples do not meet specifications.
 3. Awareness Training. The operator of the Contractor's sand and gravel surface mine or other similar
 materials source shall provide Site-Specific Hazard Awareness Training in compliance with 30 CFR
 46.11 for all the Engineer’s personnel before beginning operations. All other workers shall be given
 training in compliance with 30 CFR 46 before exposure to mine hazards. The training must be offered
 at each surface mine that will be used to supply processed aggregates. A qualified person must
 provide the training. The training shall be in accordance with the operator’s written training plan
 approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, covering the following items:
 a. Site-specific health and safety risks;
 b. Recognition and avoidance of hazards;
 c.
 
 Restricted areas;
 
 d. Warning and evacuation signals;
 
 38
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 e. Evacuation and emergency procedures;
 f.
 
 Other special safety procedures; and
 
 g. A site tour.
 The Contractor shall require the Engineer’s personnel to sign the Visitor’s Log Book upon completion
 of the training to indicate that training was provided. Training is a subsidiary cost.
 4. Type of Sources. When there is insufficient Useable Excavation, as defined in 104-1.04, the
 Contractor shall supply additional required material from one or more of the following sources:
 a. Contractor-Furnished Sources. For a material source that is a commercial plant as defined in
 Subsection 108-1.01.4.a the Contractor shall:
 (1) acquire the necessary rights and permits to obtain material from a commercial plant;
 (2) pay as subsidiary costs all related costs to obtain and use material from the source; and
 (3) be solely responsible for the quality and quantity of materials.
 For all Contractor-Furnished sources that are not a commercial plant, the Contractor shall:
 (4) Acquire the necessary rights and permits to take materials from the sources including stateowned sources that are not under the Department’s control;
 (5) Pay as subsidiary:
 (a) all related costs to obtain, develop, and use the sources, including but not limited to
 permit and mineral royalties;
 (b) the material costs identified in the Material Sales Agreement you obtain for State owned
 sources where an existing or draft Material Sales Agreement is not included in the
 contract; and
 (c) the material costs identified in the Material Sales Agreement for material obtained from
 State owned sources for which an existing or draft Material Sales Agreement is included
 in the contract;
 (5) Be solely responsible for quality and quantity of materials; and
 (6) Obtain all necessary rights, permits, and plan approvals before clearing or disturbing the
 ground in the material source. The contractor shall certify in writing to the Engineer that all
 permits and clearances relating to the use of the material source have been obtained prior to
 any clearing or ground disturbance in the materials source.
 No equitable adjustment or other compensation will be made for any additional costs, including
 increased length of haul, if the Contractor:
 (8) Chooses to change material sources for any reason;
 (9) Is unable to produce a sufficient quantity or quality of materials from Contractor-Furnished
 sources; or
 (10)Encounters unexpected, unforeseen, or unusual conditions within Contractor-Furnished
 sources.
 
 39
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 b. Mandatory Sources. The Department may identify material sources in the Contract from which
 the Contractor is required to take a specified quantity of material. No other source will be
 permitted for that portion of material unless prior approval is obtained from the Engineer. The
 Contract will specifically define these sources as Mandatory Sources and define rights and
 stipulations for each site. The Department will provide a materials report for these sources.
 The Contractor acknowledges that samples from within a source may not be representative of the
 entire source. The Contractor must expect variations of quality and quantity within the source and
 shall factor that contingency into the unit bid price for the material. No equitable adjustment will
 be paid for variations encountered within the source.
 When using a Mandatory Source, if it is found that the quality or quantity of material producible
 from the Mandatory Source does not meet project requirements, and a change of source is
 necessary for that reason alone, a Change Order with equitable adjustment will be made.
 c.
 
 Designated Sources. The Department may identify material sources in the Contract which are
 available to the Contractor but which the Contractor is not required to use. The Contract will
 specifically define these sources as Designated Sources and define rights and stipulations for
 each site. The Department will provide a materials report for these sources.
 The Contractor acknowledges that samples from within a source may not be representative of the
 entire source. The Contractor must expect variations of quality and quantity within the source and
 shall factor that contingency into the unit bid price for the material. No equitable adjustment will
 be paid for variations encountered within the source.
 If the Contractor elects to use a Designated Source, and it is found that the quality or quantity of
 material producible from the Designated Source does not meet project requirements, and a
 change of source is necessary for that reason alone, a Change Order with equitable adjustment
 will be made. If the Contractor chooses to change between or among sources for any other
 reason than quantity or quality of material, no equitable adjustment will be paid.
 
 d. Available Sources. The Department may identify other material sources that are available for use
 for the project by the Contractor. The Contract will specifically define these sources as Available
 Sources. The Department makes no guarantee as to quality or quantity of material in Available
 Sources. The Contractor is responsible for determining the quality and quantity of material, and if
 additional sources are needed. The Contractor shall be responsible for identifying the rights and
 stipulations for each site with the owner of the site.
 When the Department furnishes copies of existing boring logs, test results, or other data in its
 possession concerning Available Sources, the Contractor is responsible for determining the
 accuracy and completeness of this data, for any assumptions the Contractor makes based on this
 data, and for exploring all Available Sources to the Contractor’s satisfaction.
 The Department makes no representation, guarantees, or warranty whatsoever, expressed or
 implied, as to:
 (1) The quality or quantity of materials producible from an Available Source, even if such
 information is indicated in a Materials Report or Soils Investigation Report;
 (2) Whether boring logs, test results or data reliably represent current existing subsurface
 conditions;
 (3) Whether interpretations of the boring logs, test results, or other data are correct;
 (4) Whether moisture conditions and indicated water tables vary from those found at the time
 borings were made;
 
 40
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 (5) Whether the ground at the location of the borings was physically disturbed or altered after the
 boring was made; and
 (6) The condition, materials, or proportions of the materials between borings, regardless of any
 subsurface information the Department may make available.
 The availability of subsurface information from the Department shall not relieve the Contractor
 from any risks, or of any duty to make on-site examinations and investigations, or of any other
 responsibility under the Contract or as may be required by law.
 No equitable adjustment will be made if the quality or quantity of material available from an
 Available Source is not as represented in any information provided by the Department, nor if a
 change of source is necessary for any other reason whatsoever. The use of Available Sources is
 entirely at the Contractor's option and the Contractor bears all risk associated with their decision
 to use an Available Source.
 e. Excluded Material Sources. Department owned, managed, or permitted material sources not
 identified in the Contract are excluded from use for the project. This exclusion does not prevent
 the Contractor from considering material sources as provided for in Subsection 106-1.02.(4.)(a.)
 Contractor-Furnished Sources, unless the Contract specifically identifies a source as an Excluded
 Material Source, nor does it prevent post-award consideration of other material sources as
 provided under Subsection 104-1.06.
 5. Rights, Permits and Plan Approvals for Material Sources. Before disturbing the site of a material
 source, the Contractor shall acquire and pay for all necessary rights, permits and plan approvals
 indicated in this Subsection and in Subsection 107-1.02. For each material site the Contractor shall:
 a. Acquire approval for a Mining and Reclamation Plan (MRP) or receive an exemption, in
 accordance with AS 27.19. The MRP shall include:
 (1) Plan and cross-sectional views of the site;
 (2) Applicable boundaries or property lines;
 (3) Areas and depths to be developed;
 (4) Locations of access roads, stripping, sorting, and unsuitable material piles, crushing and
 plant sites, stockpile sites, drainage features, erosion and pollution control features; and
 (5) Condition the Contractor will leave the site after the materials extraction is completed,
 including reseeding.
 b. Submit a SWPPP as required by Section 641.
 6. Reclamation. After completing work in a materials source, the Contractor shall finish and grade work
 areas to a neat, acceptable condition in accordance with the approved MRP. Reclamation of a
 Contractor-furnished source will be in accord with the Contractor's MRP.
 106-1.03 TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE. Materials are subject to inspection and testing by the
 Department at any time before, during, or after they are incorporated into the project. Use of untested
 materials is at the Contractor's risk. The Contractor shall remove and replace unacceptable material
 according to Subsection 105-1.11.
 1. Quality Control. The Contractor is responsible for the quality of construction and materials used in the
 work. Quality control is process control, and includes all activities that ensure that a product meets
 Contract specifications. Quality control is subsidiary to the applicable items. The Contractor shall
 perform quality control as follows:
 41
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 a. Submit a Quality Control Plan no less than five working days before the preconstruction
 conference. Include, for each item being produced, the methods to be used for sampling and
 testing, the proposed testing frequency, personnel qualifications, and equipment descriptions.
 Include the use of control charts, chart update frequency, chart posting location, and criteria for
 corrective action.
 b. Sample materials during manufacturing or processing and perform quality control tests, as
 needed, to ensure materials produced conform to the Contract Specifications. Document quality
 control tests and make them available to the Engineer on a daily basis.
 c.
 
 Sample and test according to test methods required in the Specifications.
 
 2. Acceptance Testing. The Department has the exclusive right and responsibility for determining the
 acceptability of the construction and incorporated materials.
 The Department will sample materials and perform acceptance tests at its expense. Copies of tests
 will be furnished to the Contractor upon request.
 The Contractor shall not rely on the Department’s acceptance testing for its quality control. The
 Department's acceptance testing is not a substitute for the Contractor's quality control. The Engineer
 may retest materials that have failed the Department's acceptance test, but is not required to do so.
 3. Quality Level Analysis (QLA). All statistical Quality Level Analysis (QLA) is computed using the
 Engineer’s Price Adjustment program. The program calculates all intermediate values to 16 decimal
 places. Pay factors are rounded to the nearest 0.001. The basis of payment for production lots of
 selected pay items is adjusted using statistical analysis of acceptance test results. Analysis is based
 on an Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) of 90 percent. The AQL is the minimum Percent Within Limits
 (PWL) at which the material is considered fully acceptable and receives a 1.000 pay factor. As an
 incentive to produce quality material, a pay factor greater than 1.000 is possible. The maximum pay
 factor obtainable is 1.050.
 The procedure for estimating the PWL uses the number (n), the arithmetic mean ( ), and the sample
 standard deviation (s), of acceptance test results as shown below. If the sample standard deviation is
 less than 0.001, then it is set at 0.001.
 a. The arithmetic mean is computed:
 Where:
 
 = test result for sublot i.
 sum of values from sublot 1 to n.
 
 b. The sample standard deviation is computed:
 The upper specification limit (USL) and lower specification limit (LSL) are equal to the Target Value
 (TV) plus and minus the allowable tolerances as defined in the pay item specification.
 Quality Indexes are computed as shown below. The maximum Quality Index obtainable is 10.000.
 c.
 
 The Upper Quality Index (QU) is computed:
 
 d. The Lower Quality Index (QL) is computed:
 
 42
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 The computed QU and QL are used with AASHTO R 9 to determine the Percent Within Upper Limits
 (PWLU) and Percent Within Lower Limits (PWLL).
 e. The PWL used in pay factor determination is:
 When material requirements are one-sided, with only an upper or lower limit, then the PWL is equal to
 the percent within the side that has a limit. For example, if a material only has an upper specification
 (maximum) limit, then PWL= PWLU. Also, two-sided specification limits with one side that cannot be
 exceeded (like 100 percent passing) will be analyzed as if they are one-sided.
 f.
 
 The pay factor (PF) is:
 Where: PWL varies from 50.000 to 100.000.
 When PWL is less than 50.000, the pay factor (PF) = zero
 
 106-1.04 PLANT INSPECTION. The Department may periodically inspect manufacturing methods,
 manufactured lots and materials at the source of production. The Department may approve, conditionally
 approve, or reject them.
 The Contractor shall:
 1. Notify the Department of the production and fabrication schedule at least 30 days before beginning
 work on any item requiring inspection, and notify the Department 48 hours before beginning
 production or fabrication;
 2. Give the inspector full and safe access to all parts of the plant used to manufacture or produce
 materials; and
 3. Cooperate fully and assist the inspector during the inspection.
 Materials may be rejected if the Department requests a plant inspection and the materials are produced
 or fabricated without a plant inspection. The materials may be tested at any time before final acceptance,
 whether in place or not, and whether approved at a plant inspection or not. If the materials do not meet
 Contract specifications, they may be rejected and ordered removed under Subsection 105-1.11. If
 rejected materials are incorporated into the project, the Department may require those materials to be
 removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense under Subsection 105-1.11.
 106-1.05 CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE. The submittal requirements of this subsection are in
 addition to the submittal requirements of 106-1.01 Buy America Provision.
 The Engineer may authorize the use of certain materials or assemblies based on either a manufacturer's
 certification or based on a Contractor’s summary sheet with applicable documentation attached.
 1. If by manufacturer’s certification, the certificate must include the project name and number, the
 signature of the manufacturer, and must include information that clearly demonstrates the material or
 assembly fully complies with the Contract requirements.
 2. If by Contractor’s summary sheet, the summary sheet must include the project name and number, the
 signature of the contractor, and must include attached documentation that clearly demonstrates the
 material or assembly fully complies with the Contract requirements.
 Electronic submittals that are submitted by email from the Contractor’s email account are considered
 signed by the Contractor.
 
 43
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 The Contractor shall submit additional certificates of compliance or test data if required by the Contract or
 by the Engineer. The Engineer may refuse permission to incorporate materials or products into the
 project based on a certificate of compliance that does not meet the Contract requirements.
 106-1.06 STORAGE OF MATERIALS. Materials shall be stored to preserve their quality and fitness for
 the work, and so they can be readily inspected. Materials inspected before storage may be inspected
 again, before or after being incorporated into the project. The Contractor shall:
 1. Use only approved portions of the project site for storage of materials and equipment or plant
 operations;
 2. Provide any additional space needed for such purposes without extra compensation;
 3. Restore Department-owned or controlled storage and plant sites to their original condition without
 extra compensation;
 4. Obtain the landowner's or lessee’s written permission before storing material on private property, and
 furnish copies of the permission to the Engineer, if requested; and
 5. Restore privately owned or leased storage sites, without extra compensation from the Department, to
 their original condition or as agreed to between the Contractor and the private owner.
 106-1.07 DEPARTMENT-FURNISHED MATERIAL. Material furnished by the Department will be made
 available to the Contractor at a state yard or delivered at the locations specified in the Special Provisions.
 The Contractor shall include the cost of handling and placing all materials after they are delivered in the
 Contract price for the item in connection with which they are used. The Contractor is responsible for all
 material delivered to the Contractor. Deductions will be made from any monies due the Contractor to
 make good shortages and deficiencies from any cause whatsoever, for any damage that may occur after
 delivery, and for demurrage charges.
 106-1.08 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURE. The Contractor shall complete a Submittal Register, and shall
 submit it to the Engineer on forms provided by the Department or similar forms of the Contractor’s choice
 as approved by the Engineer. The intent of the Submittal Register is to provide a blueprint for the smooth
 flow of specified project documents. The Contractor shall fill it out sequentially by bid item and allow at
 least three spaces between bid items. The Submittal Register shall list all working drawings, schedules of
 work, and other items required to be submitted to the Department by the Contractor including but not
 limited to: Progress Schedule, anticipated dates of material procurement, Construction Phasing Plan,
 Traffic Control Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Quality Control Program, Utility Progress
 Schedule, Blasting Plan, Mining Plan, annual EEO reports, DBE payment documentation and
 subcontracts.
 The Contractor shall submit materials (product) information to the Engineer for review, as required by the
 Contract.
 Unless otherwise specified, provide all submittals in an electronic format acceptable to the Engineer.
 If the Contract has a duration of 180 days or less, the Contractor shall, within fifteen days after the date of the
 Notice to Proceed, submit to the Department for review all submittals and the submittal register. If the
 Contract has a duration greater than 180 days, the Contractor shall, within fifteen days after the date of the
 Notice to Proceed, submit to the Department for review, an anticipated schedule for transmitting submittals.
 Each submittal shall include a Submittal Summary sheet. The Contractor shall sign submittals and submit
 them to the Engineer. Electronic submittals that are submitted by email from the Contractor’s email
 account are considered signed. The Department will return submittals to the Contractor as either:
 approved, conditionally approved with the conditions listed, or rejected with the reasons listed. The
 Contractor may resubmit a rejected submittal to the Engineer with more information or corrections. The
 44
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 106
 
 Department’s approval of a submittal in no way relieves the Contractor of its responsibility for the means,
 methods, techniques, sequence, and procedures of construction, safety, and quality control.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for timely submittals. Failure by the Department to review submittals
 within 30 days or as otherwise provided in the applicable subsection may be the basis for a request for
 extension of Contract time but not for additional compensation.
 Payment for a specific contract item will not be made until the Department has received the Submittal
 Register for all items and approved all required submittals for that specific contract item.
 When material invoices, freight bills, and mill certificates are submitted, they shall provide sufficient
 information for the Engineer to identify: the date, supplier and origin of invoice (bill, certificate); project
 name and number where material will be incorporated; manufacturer, product number, quantity, cost and
 bid item.

 Neither the acceptance by the Department, or by any representative of the Department, nor any
 payment for or acceptance of the whole or any part of the work, nor any extension of time, nor
 any possession taken by the Department, shall operate as a waiver by the Department of any
 portion of the Contract or of any right of the Department to damages. A waiver by the Department
 of any breach of the Contract shall not be held to be a waiver of any other subsequent breach.

 when directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall submit a revised progress schedule in the
 form required, including a written explanation for each revision made in the schedule or methods
 of operation.
 The Engineer's review or approval of the documents, plans, and schedules provided by the
 Contractor under this section shall not change the Contract requirements, release the Contractor
 of the responsibility for successful completion of the work or relieve the Contractor of the duty to
 comply with applicable laws. The Engineer’s review or approval of schedules shall not indicate
 agreement with any assertions of delay or claims by the Contractor.
 It is the Contractor's responsibility to prepare and submit documents that satisfy all applicable
 contract requirements. By reviewing and approving the Contractor’s documents, the Department
 does not warrant that following the Contractor’s documents will result in successful performance
 of the work. The Department's failure to discover defects in the Contractor's documents, the
 assumptions upon which they are based or conditions that prevent the Contractor from
 performing the work as indicated in the documents will not entitle the Contractor to additional
 compensation or time. If the Contractor becomes aware of any act or occurrence that may form
 the basis of a claim for additional compensation or an extension of time, it must specifically
 advise the Engineer of these conditions in accordance with Subsection 105-1.17.

 108-1.05 CHARACTER OF WORKERS, METHODS, AND EQUIPMENT. The Contractor shall
 employ sufficient labor and equipment to complete the work required under the Contract and to
 complete it on time.
 The Contractor shall ensure that all workers on the project have the skills and experience
 necessary to properly perform their assigned work. Workers engaged in special work or skilled
 work shall have sufficient experience in that work and in the operation of the equipment required
 to properly perform that work.
 The Contractor shall comply with any written order by the Engineer to remove workers, who, in
 the opinion of the Engineer, perform the work in an unskilled manner, who are intemperate or
 disorderly, or who jeopardize the safety of the public, other workers or Engineer’s personnel. The
 Contractor shall allow removed workers to return to the project only with the Engineer’s written
 permission. The Engineer may suspend the work if the Contractor fails to furnish suitable and
 sufficient personnel necessary to perform the work, or fails to remove any worker at the
 Engineer's order.
 The Contractor shall not use prisoner labor on the project.

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 The Contractor shall use equipment of the appropriate size and mechanical condition to produce
 the specified quality and quantity of work by the means specified in the Contract, if any, and shall
 ensure that the equipment does not damage roadways or property.
 The Contractor shall ensure all equipment, materials, and articles incorporated into the work are
 new and of the specified quality, unless the Contract specifically permits otherwise.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a list of all powered equipment that will be used on
 the project, showing the make, model, year, capacity, horsepower, and related information. The
 Contractor shall update this list when equipment is added or removed from the work site, but
 need not update more frequently than weekly.
 When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor are not prescribed by the
 contract, the Contractor is free to use any method, means or equipment that is satisfactory to
 produce the specified work in conformity with the Contract, except as provided above. At the
 request of the Engineer, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the method, means and equipment
 chosen will produce the work specified in the Contract in the time allowed under the Contract.
 The Contractor shall bear all costs and impacts associated with any means, methods and
 equipment chosen by the Contractor. No suggestion, statement or observation from the Engineer
 or other Department representatives shall alter this responsibility.
 If the Contract specifies a particular method, means or type of equipment for performance of the
 work, the Contractor must use that method, means or equipment unless the Contractor first
 requests, in writing, permission to alter the Contract requirement and receives prior written
 approval from the Engineer.
 108-1.06 CONTRACT TIME, EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME AND SUSPENSION OF
 WORK. Contract time will be specified in calendar days, by completion date, or both.
 1. Calendar Days. When the contract time is specified on a calendar days basis, all work under
 the Contract shall be completed within the number of calendar days specified. If no starting
 day is specified in the Contract, the count of Contract time begins on the day following receipt
 of the Notice to Proceed by the Contractor.
 Calendar days shall continue to be counted against Contract time until and including the date
 of project completion. Calendar days shall not be counted during the period from November 1
 through April 30, except for days that the Contractor is working on the project site.
 2. Completion Date. When the contract time is specified on a completion date basis, all work
 under the Contract shall be completed by the specified completion date.
 3. Reasons for Suspension of Work and Extension of Contract Time. The Department may
 order a suspension of work for any reason listed in this subparagraph 3, items a through p.
 The Department shall not pay additional compensation, but may extend Contract time only, if
 there are delays in the completion of controlling items of work from unforeseeable causes
 that are beyond the Contractor's control and are not the result of the Contractor's fault or
 negligence, including:
 a. Acts of God;
 b. Acts of the public enemy;
 c.
 
 Fires;
 
 d. Floods;
 e. Epidemics;

 SECTION 108
 
 f.
 
 Quarantine restrictions;
 
 g. Strikes;
 h. Freight embargoes;
 i.
 
 Unusually severe weather;
 
 j.
 
 In accordance with Subsection 105-1.06.4.d, delays by utility owners beyond completion
 dates specified in the Special Provisions for relocating or adjusting utilities and related
 facilities; or
 
 k.
 
 Delays of subcontractors, suppliers and fabricators from unforeseeable causes beyond
 the control of the subcontractors, suppliers or fabricators and that are not the fault of the
 subcontractors, suppliers or fabricators, including those causes listed in this
 Subparagraph 3, Items a through j.
 
 No additional Contract time or additional compensation will be allowed due to delays caused
 by or suspensions ordered due to:
 l.
 
 Failure to correct unsafe conditions for the workers or the public;
 
 m. Adverse weather that is not unusually severe;
 n. Failure to carry out Contract provisions;
 o. Failure to carry out orders given by the Engineer; or
 p. Failure to timely obtain materials, equipment, or services.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer as soon as the Contractor becomes aware of any act
 or occurrence that may form the basis of a request for a time extension under this section.
 The Contractor shall submit a request for a time extension to the Engineer within 10 days of
 the act or occurrence, and if an agreement is not reached, the Contractor may submit a Claim
 under Subsection 105-1.17.
 The time allowed in the Contract, as awarded, is based on performing the original estimated
 quantities of work set out in the bid schedule. An assertion that insufficient time was originally
 specified shall not constitute a valid reason for extension of contract time. If satisfactory
 fulfillment of the Contract requires extra work, the Department may extend Contract time on a
 basis commensurate with the amount and difficulty of the extra work, provided that the extra
 work is for a controlling item.
 4. Suspension of Work. The Engineer will suspend work on the project, in whole or in part, for
 such periods and for such reasons as the Engineer determines to be reasonable, necessary,
 in the public interest, or for the convenience of the Department.
 a. The Engineer will issue a written order to suspend, delay, or interrupt all or any part of the
 work. The Contractor shall not be compensated for the suspension, delay, or interruption
 if it is imposed for a reasonable time under the circumstances.
 b. Unless another Contract section specifically provides otherwise, the Contractor will be
 compensated by equitable adjustment for a suspension, delay, or interruption of the work
 only if:
 (1) The period of suspension, delay, or interruption is for an unreasonable time under the
 circumstances and another Contract section allows compensation in the event of a
 
 60
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 suspension, delay, or interruption of the work under the circumstances that actually
 caused the suspension, delay, or interruption; or
 (2) The delay, suspension, or interruption results from the Department’s failure to fulfill a
 contractual obligation to the Contractor within the time period specified in the
 Contract or, if no time period is specified, within a reasonable time.
 c.
 
 No equitable adjustment will be made under this subsection for any suspension, delay, or
 interruption of the work if the Contractor's performance would have been suspended,
 delayed, or interrupted by any other cause for which:
 (1) The Department is not responsible under the Contract, including the Contractor's
 fault or negligence; or
 (2) An equitable adjustment is either provided for or excluded under any other section of
 this Contract.
 
 d. Claims for equitable adjustments under this section shall be filed under Subsection 1051.17 except that:
 (1) The Contractor must give written notice of intent to claim no later than 20 days after
 the event giving rise to the delay, suspension, or interruption; and
 (2) The claim may not include any costs incurred more than 20 days before the
 Contractor files the Contractor's written notice of intent to claim.
 108-1.07 FAILURE TO COMPLETE ON TIME. For each calendar day that the work is not
 substantially complete after the expiration of the Contract time or the completion date has
 passed, the Engineer shall deduct the full daily charge corresponding to the original Contract
 amount shown in Table 108-1 from progress payments.
 For each calendar day that the work is substantially complete but the project is not complete,
 after the expiration of the Contract time or the completion date has passed, the Engineer shall
 deduct 20 percent of the daily charge corresponding to the original Contract amount shown in
 Table 108-1 from progress payments.
 If no money is due the Contractor, the Department may recover these sums from the Contractor,
 from the Surety, or from both. These are liquidated damages and not penalties. These charges
 shall reimburse the Department for its additional administrative expenses incurred due to the
 Contractor's failure to complete the work within the time specified.

 Permitting the Contractor to continue work after the Contract time has elapsed or the completion
 date has passed does not waive the Department’s rights to collect liquidated damages under this
 section.
 108-1.08 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT. The Contracting Officer will give a written Notice of Default
 to the Contractor and the Surety if the Contractor:
 1. Fails to begin work under the Contract within the time specified;
 2. Fails to perform the work with sufficient workers, equipment, or materials to ensure the
 prompt completion of the work;
 3. Performs the work unsuitably or neglects or refuses to remove materials or to replace
 rejected work;
 4. Discontinues the prosecution of the work;
 5. Fails to resume work that has been discontinued within a reasonable time after notice to do
 so;
 6. Becomes insolvent except that if the Contractor declares bankruptcy, termination shall be in
 accordance with the Federal Bankruptcy Code. In the event that the Contractor declares
 bankruptcy, the Contractor agrees that the Contract will be assumed by the Surety in a timely
 manner so as to complete the Contract by the date specified in the Contract;
 7. Allows any final judgment to stand against the Contractor unsatisfied for a period of 60 days;
 8. Makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, without the consent of the Engineer;
 9. Fails to comply with applicable minimum wage or civil rights requirements;
 10. Is a party to fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or malfeasance in connection with the Contract;
 or
 11. Fails to perform the work in an acceptable manner for any other cause whatsoever.
 The written Notice of Default will include a notice to cure and will establish a date by which the
 cure must be completed. The Contracting Officer may allow more time to cure than originally
 stated in the Notice to Default if the Contracting Officer deems it to be in the best interests of the
 Department. Failure to cure the delay, neglect, or default within the time specified in the
 Contracting Officer’s Notice of Default authorizes the Department to terminate the contract. The
 Department will provide the Contractor and the Contractor's Surety with a written Notice of
 Termination.
 After the Notice of Termination is issued, the Department may take over the work without further
 notice; may complete it by itself, by contract or otherwise; and may take possession of and use
 materials, appliances, equipment, or plant on the work site necessary for completing the work.
 The Department may transfer the obligation to perform the work from the Contractor to the
 Surety. In that event, the Surety shall submit its plan for completion of the work, including any
 contracts or agreements with third parties for completion, to the Department for approval before
 beginning work. The Surety must follow the Contract requirements for approval of subcontracts,
 except that the limitation on percent of work subcontracted will not apply. On receipt of the
 transfer notice, the Surety shall take possession of all materials, tools, equipment, and appliances
 at the work site, employ an appropriate work force, and complete the Contract work as specified.
 The Contract specifications and requirements shall remain in effect, except that the Department
 will make subsequent Contract payments directly to the Surety. The Contractor forfeits any right
 
 62
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 to claim for the work and is not entitled to receive any further balance of the amount to be paid
 under the Contract.
 The Contractor and the Contractor's Surety are jointly and severally liable for any damage to the
 Department resulting from the Contractor's delay, neglect, or default, whether or not the
 Department terminates the Contractor's right to prosecute the work. The Department's damages
 include any increased costs incurred by the Department in completing the work or paying for the
 work to be completed. The Department's rights and remedies are in addition to any other rights
 and remedies provided by law or under the Contract.
 If, after notice of termination of the Contractor's right to proceed under this clause, it is
 determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights
 and obligations of the parties will be determined under Subsection 108-1.09, Termination for
 Convenience.
 108-1.09 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE.
 1. Notice. The Contracting Officer may terminate the Contract in whole or in part due to:
 a. Executive Orders of the President of the United States or the Governor of the State of
 Alaska with respect to the prosecution of war or the interest of national defense, or any
 disaster declaration.
 b. Restraining orders or injunctions by a court of competent jurisdiction affecting prosecution
 of the work based on acts or omissions of persons or agencies other than the Contractor.
 c.
 
 Any reason determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the
 Department.
 
 The Contracting Officer will issue a written Notice of Termination to the Contractor. The
 Notice of Termination shall state the extent to which performance of work under the Contract
 is terminated, the effective date of the termination, and for which of the above-listed reasons
 the Contract is terminated.
 2. Required Actions. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, upon receipt of a
 Notice of Termination the Contractor shall immediately:
 a. Stop work as directed in the Notice.
 b. Place no further orders or subcontracts for materials, services, or facilities except as
 approved to complete work not terminated.
 c.
 
 Terminate all orders and subcontracts for the terminated work.
 
 d. Accomplish either (1) or (2) below as directed by the Contracting Officer:
 (1) Assign to the Department all right, title and interest in any terminated orders or
 subcontracts. The Contracting Officer will settle all claims on the terminated orders or
 subcontracts.
 (2) Settle any outstanding liabilities and claims arising from termination of orders and
 subcontracts. Settlements must be limited to costs allowed under this Section.
 e. Submit to the Contracting Officer a list, certified as to quantity and quality, of all materials
 acquired or produced for incorporation into the project and that are properly allocable to
 the terminated portion of the project, exclusive of items disposed of under Subsection
 108-1.09.2.f., below.
 
 63
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 f.
 
 Dispose of materials in the Contractor’s possession or control that were acquired or
 produced but not incorporated into the project as of the termination date as directed by
 the Contracting Officer under either (1) or (2) below:
 (1) Transfer title and deliver the materials to the Department. The Department will pay for
 the materials at the actual cost delivered to the project or storage site, including
 transportation charges, to which cost 15 percent will be added.
 (2) Sell the materials. Credit will not have to be extended to prospective purchasers.
 The Contractor may acquire the materials if the Contracting Officer approves the sale
 price and the Contractor meets any other conditions prescribed by the Contracting
 Officer.
 At the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, the proceeds of any sale, transfer, or
 disposition of materials may be:
 (3) applied to reduce any payments to be made by the Department under the Contract,
 (4) credited to the cost of the work, or
 (5) paid in any other manner as directed.
 
 g. Deliver to the Department completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information,
 and other property required to be furnished under the Contract.
 h. Take all necessary actions and comply with all directives to protect contract-related
 property in which the Department has or may acquire an interest.
 i.
 
 Complete work not terminated.
 
 The Contractor shall proceed immediately with performance of the above obligations
 notwithstanding any delay in determining or adjusting the amount of any item or reimbursable
 cost under this clause.
 3. Claim. The Contractor shall submit any termination claim to the Contracting Officer within 90
 days after the effective date of termination, unless the date for submitting a claim is extended
 in writing by the Contracting Officer.
 a. Without duplication of any amount paid for under Subsection 108-1.09.2., the claim may
 be for the total of:
 (1) costs incurred in performing the terminated work from the date of Contract award to
 the effective date of the termination subject to the provisions of Subsection 1081.09.3.b. regarding reimbursement of equipment costs and Subsection 108-1.09.3.c.
 regarding unallowable items.
 (2) payments approved by the Contracting Officer under Subsection 108-1.09.2.d.(2) to
 settle the termination claims of suppliers and subcontractors to the extent not
 covered under Subsection 108-1.09.3.a.(1).
 (3) reasonably incurred costs for:
 (a) accounting, legal, clerical, and other costs reasonably necessary for preparation
 of the termination claim and settlement negotiations, excluding costs incurred
 after the date an appeal is filed with the Appeals Officer under Subsection 1081.09.8.
 
 64
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 (b) settling subcontractor and supplier claims, excluding the amounts of those
 settlements paid under Subsection 108-1.09.3.a.(2).
 (4) reasonable profit on the costs included in Subsection 108-1.09.3.a(1) based on the
 Contractor’s bid rate for profit or as determined under any other reasonable
 accounting method. However, if it appears that the Contractor would have sustained
 a loss on the entire Contract had it been completed, the Contracting Officer will allow
 no profit and will reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss under
 Subsection 108-1.09.4. The Department will not pay profit on costs included in
 Subsections 108-1.09.3.a.(2) and 108-1.09.3.a.(3).
 b. Equipment claims will be reimbursed as follows:
 (1) Contractor-owned equipment usage, based on the Contractor’s ownership and
 operating costs for each piece of equipment as determined from the Contractor’s
 accounting records. Do not base equipment claims on published rental rates.
 (2) Idle time for Contractor-owned equipment, based on the Contractor’s internal
 ownership and depreciation costs. Idle equipment time is limited to the actual period
 of time equipment is idle as a direct result of the termination, not to exceed 30 days.
 Operating expenses will not be included for payment of idle equipment time.
 (3) Rented equipment, based on reasonable, actual rental costs. Equipment leased
 under “capital leases” as defined in Financial Accounting Standard No. 13 will be
 considered Contractor-owned equipment. Equipment leased from an affiliate,
 division, subsidiary or other organization under common control with the Contractor
 will be considered Contractor-owned equipment, unless the affiliate, division,
 subsidiary or other organization has an established practice of leasing to unaffiliated
 lessees.
 c. The following costs are not payable under a termination settlement agreement or
 Contracting Officer’s determination of the termination claim, or on appeal:
 (1) Loss of anticipated profits or consequential or compensatory damages
 (2) Unabsorbed home office overhead (also termed “General & Administrative Expense”)
 related to ongoing business operations
 (3) Bidding and project investigative costs
 (4) Direct costs of repairing equipment to render it operable for use on the terminated
 work
 4. Adjustment for Loss. If the Contractor would have sustained a loss on the entire Contract had
 it been completed, the Department will not pay the Contractor more than the total of:
 a. The amount due for termination claim costs under Subsection 108-1.09.3.a.(3); plus
 b. The remainder of the total allowable claim amount due reduced by multiplying the
 remainder by the ratio of (1) the total contract price to (2) the remainder plus the
 estimated cost to complete the entire Contract; minus
 c.
 
 All disposal and other credits, all advance and progress payments and all other amounts
 previously paid under the Contract.
 
 5. Deductions. In arriving at the amount due under this Subsection, the Department will deduct:
 a. All previous payments made before termination;
 
 65
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 b. Any claim which the Department may have against the Contractor;
 c.
 
 The proceeds of the sale or transfer of any materials, supplies, or other items acquired
 for the terminated work and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the Department;
 
 d. All partial payments made under this Section; and
 e. Any adjustment for loss determined under Subsection 108-1.09.4.
 6. Agreed Settlement. The Contractor shall make every effort to arrive at a claim settlement with
 the Contracting Officer that is fair to both parties, that reflects the reasonable and allocable
 incurred costs allowable under Subsection 108-1.09.3, that includes a profit under Subsection
 108-1.09.3.a.(4) or, where appropriate, a loss adjustment under Subsection 108-1.09.4, and
 that takes into account the Contractor’s reasonable business judgment in performing the
 work.
 The total settlement, whether determined under this Subsection 108-1.09.6 or under
 Subsection 108-1.09.7, exclusive of the costs listed in Subsection 108-1.09.3.a.(3), may not
 exceed the total contract price as reduced by previous payments made and the contract price
 of work not terminated.
 If an agreement is reached in whole or in part, the Department will amend the contract and
 will pay the agreed amount.
 7. Determined Settlement. If the Contractor fails to submit a termination claim within the time
 allowed, or if an agreement is not reached on the amount due, the Contracting Officer may
 determine in a Contracting Officer’s Decision, the amount due under Subsection 108-1.09 on
 the basis of information available to the Department.
 8. Right of Appeal. The Contractor may appeal a Contracting Officer’s Decision within the time
 and in the manner specified in Subsection 105-1.17.
 9. Partial Payments. In the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Department may make
 partial payments against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the terminated
 portion of the Contract. The sum of these partial payments will not exceed the Contracting
 Officer’s estimate of the total amount that will be due as a result of the termination. The
 estimate will be based on available information. The Contracting Officer may adjust the
 estimate as additional information becomes available. If the Contracting Officer orders an
 audit of the Contractor’s financial or project records, the Contracting Officer may decline to
 make partial payments until the audit is completed.
 10. No Waiver of Rights. The termination of work by the Department does not affect or extinguish
 any of the rights of the Department against the Contractor or the Contractor’s Surety then
 existing or which may thereafter accrue. Any retention or payment of monies by the
 Department due under the terms of the Contract will not release the Contractor or the
 Contractor’s Surety from the contractual obligations or warranties made under Subsection
 107-1.19 or elsewhere in the Contract.
 11. Retaining Records. The Contractor shall unless otherwise provided for in the Contract or by
 applicable statute, keep all books, records, documents, and other evidence bearing on the
 Contractor’s cost and expenses under the Contract and relating to the work terminated for a
 period of 3 years after final settlement under this Contract. Records must be made available
 to the Department at the Contractor’s office and at all reasonable times.
 12. Definitions. In this Subsection 108-1.09, the term “cost” and the term “expense” mean a
 monetary amount in U.S. Dollars actually incurred by the Contractor, actually reflected in the
 
 66
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 108
 
 Contractor’s contemporaneously maintained accounting or other financial records and
 supported by original source documentation.
 13. Cost Principles. The Department may use the federal cost principles at 48 CFR §§ 31.201-1
 to 31.205-52 (or succeeding cost principles for fixed price contracts) as guidelines in
 determining allowable costs under this Subsection to the extent they are applicable to
 highway construction contracts and consistent with the specifications of this Contract. The
 provisions of this contract control where they are more restrictive than, or inconsistent with,
 these federal cost principles.

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109-1.01 GENERAL. Wherever the Contract provides that certain work is subsidiary or it is
 without extra compensation, the payment for that work is included in the payment for other items
 of work, and no further or additional payment shall be made for that work.
 When more than one type of material or work is specified for a pay item, letter or numeric suffixes
 included within parentheses following the pay item number are used to differentiate the types.
 Lump sum items will not be measured for payment. The Contractor shall accept the bid amount
 for a lump sum item as complete payment for all work necessary to complete that item. Quantities
 shown for lump sum items are approximate. No adjustment in the lump sum price will be made if
 the quantity furnished is more or less than the estimated quantity unless the Contract specifically
 states otherwise.
 109-1.02 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES. All work completed under the Contract will be
 measured using the U.S. Customary system of measure. The Engineer may agree for purposes
 of making progress payments to use a method of measurement other than the methods
 described below. However, all final payments for quantities will be calculated using one or more
 of the methods of measurement described below and in the applicable pay item section. Unless
 otherwise specified, work will be measured as follows:
 2
 
 1. Acre (43,560 ft ). Horizontally, unless specified on the ground surface. No deductions will be
 2
 made for individual fixtures with an area of 500 ft or less.
 2. Contingent Sum. Measured as specified in the Contract or Directive authorizing the work. The
 method of payment may include: (1) a lump sum basis, (2) a price multiplied by the units of
 work performed, (3) a pay adjustment based on the quality of work, or (4) a deduction from
 the contract amount.
 3
 
 3. Cubic Yard (yd ). At the location specified using method a, below. Methods b through e may
 be used with written approval of the Engineer.
 a. Average End Area. End area is the calculated area between original ground cross section
 and either the design cross section or at the Engineer’s discretion the final cross section.
 Volume of material is calculated using the average of end areas multiplied by the
 distance along centerline between end areas. In extreme cases where most of the
 earthwork lies along a single horizontal curve the Engineer may compute volume using
 the average of end areas multiplied by the distance along centroid of cross section
 between end areas.
 b. Three-Dimensional. Where it is impractical to measure material by cross sectioning due
 to erratic location of isolated deposits, acceptable methods involving three-dimensional
 measurements may be used.
 c.
 
 Neat Line. Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the Plans or as
 altered to fit field conditions.
 
 d. Nominal. Volume calculated as nominal width times nominal thickness times the average
 length of each piece.
 e. Weight. With the Engineer’s written approval, material that is specified to be measured by
 volume may be weighed and converted to volume for payment purposes. The Engineer
 will determine the appropriate conversion factors. When liquid asphalt is a pay item,
 ASTM D4311 will be used to convert from weight to volume at 60 °F.
 
 68
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 4. Cubic Yard Vehicle Measure (CYVM). Material measured by volume in the hauling vehicle
 will be measured at the point of delivery. Vehicles may be of any acceptable size or type
 provided that the volume of the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined.
 Vehicles shall be loaded to the measured vehicle volume. If vehicles are not loaded to the
 measured vehicle volume, the Engineer at their discretion, may apply a percentage of full
 factor to the measured volume. Loads shall be leveled when directed. No payment will be
 made for loads that exceed the legal capacity of the vehicle.
 5. Linear Foot (LF). From end to end, in place, parallel to the centerline of the item or ground
 surface on which the items are placed.
 6. Thousand Feet Board Measure (MBM). Nominal volume based on nominal widths and
 thickness times actual extreme length of each piece. One thousand feet board measure =
 2
 1,000 ft X 1 inch thick.
 7. Thousand Gallon (MGal). By using method a, below. Methods b or c may be used with
 written approval of the Engineer.
 a. Measured or calibrated volume tank;
 b. Metered volume, using a certified calibrated meter; or
 c.
 
 Weighed under this subsection and converted to volume, using a specified or approved
 conversion factor.
 
 8. Mile. From end to end, measured horizontally along centerline.
 9. Pound. Using a certified scale or the net weight of packaged material as labeled by the
 manufacturer. The Engineer will accept nominal weights for standard manufactured items,
 unless otherwise specified. The Engineer will accept industry-established manufacturing
 tolerances, unless otherwise specified.
 2)
 
 10. Square Foot (ft . Parallel to the surface being measured. No deductions will be made for
 2
 individual fixtures with an area of 1 ft or less. Transverse measurement for area
 computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 2)
 
 11. Square Yard (yd . Parallel to the surface being measured. No deductions will be made for
 2
 individual fixtures with an area of 1 yd or less. Transverse measurement for area
 computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 12. Station (100 feet). Horizontally, parallel to centerline.
 13. Ton (2,000 pounds). By using method a or c, below. Method b may be used with written
 approval of the Engineer.
 a. Commercial Weighing System. Permanently installed and certified commercial scale that
 meets the requirements for the project weighing system.
 b. Invoices. Supplier’s invoice with net weight or volume converted to weight for bulk
 material that is shipped by truck or rail and is not passed through a mixing plant. Periodic
 check weighing may be required. Net certified weights or volumes of asphalt materials
 are subject to correction for temperature and foaming. All materials are subject to
 correction for material that is lost, wasted, or otherwise not incorporated into the work, for
 computing quantities.
 c.
 
 Project Weighing System. Approved automatic digital scale and scale house. All scales
 are subject to approval according to the Weights and Measures Act, AS 45.75.
 
 69
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 Spring balances and belt conveyor scales shall not be used to determine pay weight.
 The Contractor may use proportioning (batch) scales for weighing material for payment
 when the batching equipment includes an approved and certified automatic weighing,
 cycling, and monitoring system.
 Weigh scales used with a storage silo may be used to weigh the final product for
 payment, provided the scales are approved and certified.
 Vehicle scales shall be maintained with the platform level and rigid bulkheads at each
 end. The platform must be long enough to permit simultaneous weighing of the hauling
 vehicle including coupled vehicles, in a single draft. Double draft weighing is not allowed.
 Scale Requirements. The Contractor shall:
 (1) Ensure that vehicle scale(s) are installed and maintained to the standards listed in
 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Handbook 44,
 Specifications, Tolerances and other Technical Requirements for Commercial
 Weighing and Measuring Devices, as adopted by AS 45.75.050(d);
 (2) Contact the Division of Measurement Standards/Commercial Vehicle Enforcement
 (MSCVE) to coordinate scale inspections before use, at required intervals or as
 directed by the Engineer and for clarification or possible exceptions to this section;
 (3) Ensure that a weatherproof housing is provided to protect the scale
 indicating/recording equipment and allows the scale operator convenient access to
 the weigh indicator, scale computer, ticket printer, and sequential printer;

 Electronic Computerized Weighing System. The Contractor shall use an electronic
 computerized weighing system (ECWS) with the following minimum capabilities:
 (1) Computer. A computer with a self-reading scale system that includes the scale load
 cell, a sealed direct reading weight indicator, scale computer, ticket printer, and
 sequential printer, and that can record a complete shift’s transaction in an electronic
 format approved by the Engineer.
 The computer must store project numbers, all pay item descriptions for multiple
 projects and products that are weighed, and the following information for each
 hauling vehicle used on the project:
 (a) Vehicle identification number marked on the vehicle;
 (b) Tare weight; and
 (c) Maximum allowable gross vehicle weight (MAVW).
 During weighing operations, the ECWS must compare each vehicle’s gross weight to
 its MAVW. If the vehicle exceeds its MAVW, the system must alert the scale operator
 that an “overload” exists. The system must not issue a ticket for an overload.
 The computer must have a battery backup and protection for power surges or brown
 outs. The computer system must retain all stored data during a power outage and
 must operate during a power outage to allow the scale operator to shut down the
 hard drive without losing information.
 (2) Tickets. The ECWS must have a ticket printer that prints a legible, serially numbered
 weigh ticket for the Engineer with the following information on each ticket in the order
 listed:
 (a) Project number;
 (b) Item number and description;
 (c) Date weighed;
 (d) Time weighed;
 (e) Ticket number;
 (f) Vehicle Identification Number;
 (g) Maximum allowable gross vehicle weight;
 (h) Gross weight;
 (i) Tare weight;
 (j) Net weight;
 (k) Subtotal item net weight for each haul unit since start of shift; and
 (l) Accumulated item net weight for all haul units since start of shift.
 Tickets must show all weights in pounds in accordance to NIST Handbook 44, and in
 tons reported to two decimal places.
 
 71
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 After printing, the weigh ticket must automatically advance to a perforation so it can
 be torn off and handed to the driver. Each ticket shall be initialed by the scale
 operator before handoff to the driver.
 (3) Sequential Printer. A sequential printer that prints out all transactions (keystrokes)
 made by the computer concurrently with the ticket printer. For permanent commercial
 scales, the printer may print at the end of the company’s daily shift with the
 Engineer’s approval. The printer must print all scales transactions including tares,
 voided tickets, and data changes made by the scale operator. The printer must allow
 for advancing the paper manually so that the scale operator can write notes on the
 paper when special situations occur, such as voided tickets, incorrect vehicle
 identification number used, etc. The scale operator shall also note these special
 situations in the Scales Diary.
 The sequential printout shall be submitted to the Engineer at the end of each shift.
 (4) Data Files. Submit electronic data files to the Engineer at the end of each shift, with
 all ticket information produced during the shift recorded. These Data files must be
 complete and correct without conversion or manipulation.
 (5) Scale Diary. The scale operator shall keep a Scale Diary in an electronic format
 acceptable to the Engineer. The scale operator shall complete the Scale Diary with
 the following information: dates of action, type of material, source, time the scale
 opened and time the scale closed, times of scale balance, ticket sequence, time the
 haul for each material started and stopped, voided ticket numbers, vehicle
 identification numbers, times of tare and tare weights, and the scale operator’s
 signature. The Scale Diary shall include the following information on any scale used
 to weigh materials for payment:
 (a) Owner of the scales and scale locations;
 (b) Manufacturer’s name, model serial number, maximum capacity, and type of
 scales (single beam, double beam, self-reading, etc.);
 (c) Date(s) the scales were installed and/or adjusted;
 (d) Scale service company inspections and accuracy checks (attach copy);
 (e) Division of Measurement Standards inspections and accuracy checks (attach
 copy); and
 (f) Time and dates of notification of any malfunctions.
 The Scale Diary shall be given to the Engineer at the end of each shift. The Scale
 Diary is the property of the Department.
 14. Weighing Procedures
 The scale operator shall tare hauling vehicles and record tare weights at least once daily;
 perform additional tares and record additional tare weights as directed by the Engineer;
 perform tares in the presence of the Engineer when requested; and ensure that each hauling
 truck displays a unique, legible identification mark.
 The Engineer will calculate the MAVW for each vehicle and list all vehicles and their
 MAVW(s) in the scale house. The MAVW is either the maximum allowable legal weight
 determined by the Engineer when the Contractor cannot haul overloads, or the
 manufacturer’s recommended maximum allowable gross vehicle weight as certified by the
 
 72
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 Contractor when vehicles are allowed to haul overloads. Only MAVWs that the Engineer has
 provided in writing shall be used. Tickets may not be issued to a vehicle until the Engineer
 provides the MAVW.
 No payment will be made for any material weighed without using the ECWS, unless the
 Contractor obtains the Engineer’s prior written authorization. If the ECWS malfunctions or
 breaks down, weights shall be manually weighed and recorded for up to 48 hours as directed
 by the Engineer. The manual weighing operation shall meet all other Contract requirements.
 The system must generate a report either during or at the end of the day or shift that
 summarizes the number of loads and total net weight for each date, project, and product. The
 scale operator shall submit the original report to the Engineer at the end of each shift.
 No payment for any hauled material on a given date will be made until the following are
 delivered to the Engineer:
 a. Sequential printout;
 b. Daily data; and
 c.
 
 Scale Diary.
 
 The Contractor will not receive payment for any material hauled in a vehicle that does not
 conform to the requirements of Subsection 105-1.12, Load Restrictions, and this Subsection.
 The Contractor shall dump material from non-conforming vehicles until they conform, then
 reweigh the vehicles.
 When a weighing device indicates less than true weight, the Contractor will not receive
 additional payment for material previously weighed and recorded. When a weighing device
 indicates more than true weight, all material received after the last previously correct
 weighing accuracy test will be reduced by the percentage of error that exceeds 0.5 percent.
 If the Engineer incurs extra construction engineering expenses from checking non-machine
 data entries or other data irregularities, the total value of those expenses will be deducted
 from the value of the Contract item before payment.
 The Contractor shall accept natural variations in the specific gravity of aggregates, without
 adjustment in Contract unit price.
 109-1.03 SCOPE OF PAYMENT. The Department will make payment at the Contract price or
 prices for each item shown on the bid schedule or as modified by change order with specified
 price adjustments. The Contractor shall accept the Contract prices as full and complete payment
 for (a) furnishing all equipment, materials, tools, and labor necessary to complete the work in a
 complete and acceptable manner, and for (b) all of the Contractor’s risk, loss, damage, or
 expense of whatever character arising from or relating to the work and performance of the work.
 109-1.04 COMPENSATION FOR ALTERED QUANTITIES. Payment to the Contractor for unit
 price items shall be made only for the actual quantities of work performed and accepted or
 materials furnished, in conformance with the Contract. When the accepted quantities of work or
 materials vary from the quantities stated in the bid schedule, the Contractor shall accept payment
 at the original Contract unit prices for the quantities of work and materials furnished, completed
 and accepted as payment in full. Payment at the Contract unit price shall compensate the
 Contractor for all costs, expenses, and profit that the Contractor is entitled to receive for the
 altered quantities, except as provided below:
 
 73
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 •
 
 When the final quantity of a Major Contract Item varies more than 25 percent above or below
 the bid quantity, either party to the Contract may receive an equitable adjustment in the
 Contract unit price of that item. If the final quantity of work is:
 o
 
 Greater than 125 percent of the bid quantity, the equitable adjustment will be made only
 for those units that are in excess of 125 percent of the bid quantity.
 
 o
 
 Less than 75 percent of the bid quantity, the equitable adjustment will be made for those
 units of work done and accepted, except that the total payment for the item shall not
 exceed 75 percent of the total amount bid for the item.
 
 Except as provided above and in Subsection 104-1.02, no allowance shall be made for any
 increased expenses, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits suffered or
 claimed, either directly from alterations in quantities or indirectly from unbalanced allocations
 among the contract items on the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected
 reimbursements, or any other causes.
 109-1.05 COMPENSATION FOR EXTRA WORK ON TIME AND MATERIALS BASIS. When the
 Engineer orders extra work to be performed on a time and materials basis, compensation will be
 computed as follows:
 1. Labor. Based on the sum of a. through f.
 a. Total hours worked times the straight time rate of pay. The rates of pay are those
 indicated on the certified payroll for all labor and foremen in direct charge of the specific
 operations. Rates shall not exceed those for comparable labor currently employed on the
 project, and shall not include general superintendence.
 b. Overtime hours worked times the difference between the overtime rate and the straight
 time rate. No markup is allowed.
 c.
 
 Fringe benefit rate times the total hours worked. Fringe benefits include Health and
 Welfare, Pension Fund, etc., when such amounts are required by collective bargaining
 agreement or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of labor
 employed on the project.
 
 d. Workers’ Compensation Insurance at 8 percent of a. The actual net rate may be used if it
 exceeds 10 percent and if proof of rates is furnished within 30 days of the completion of
 the extra work.
 e. Either subsistence and travel allowances or prorated camp costs. If an employee is due
 and receives subsistence or camp privileges on their days off, divide that cost by the
 number of days worked that week and add to their daily subsistence entitlement. If the
 employee did not work an entire day on time and materials work, prorate the entitlement
 for the hours worked on time and materials.
 f.
 
 Markup at 35 percent of the sum of a., c., d., and e. This includes and shall fully
 compensate the Contractor for all overhead and profit, including general
 superintendence, additional bond, property damage liability insurance, unemployment
 insurance contributions, social security and other taxes, administrative overhead costs,
 and profit.
 
 2. Materials. Actual invoiced material and delivery costs plus 15 percent markup. The material
 must be approved and incorporated into the work. The Contractor shall furnish to the
 Engineer proof of payment for materials used in the work plus applicable transportation
 charges. For Contractor-produced materials, certify in writing the Contractor's actual direct
 
 74
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 costs, the quantities used, and attach cost spreadsheets and production documentation to
 verify the costs.
 3. Equipment. Includes machinery and special equipment (other than small tools) necessary for
 the work and authorized by the Engineer. No additional compensation will be made for
 overhead, profit, maintenance, service, repairs, fuels, lubricants, or replacement parts.
 a. Hourly Rental Rate. Based on rental rates in the current edition and appropriate volume
 of the Rental Rate Blue Book, by EquipmentWatch, Penton Media, Inc..
 The regular hourly rental rate is equal to the equipment rate plus the estimated hourly
 operating cost. These rates apply for equipment used during the Contractor's regular shift
 of 10 hours per day. No markup is allowed.
 The equipment rate is equal to the age adjusted monthly rate for the basic equipment
 plus the age adjusted monthly rate for applicable attachments, both divided by 176, and
 multiplied by the regional adjustment factor. The equipment rate is per hour.
 The age adjusted monthly rate is that resulting from application of the age adjustment
 formula, to eliminate replacement cost allowances in machine depreciation and
 contingency cost allowances.
 Only the attachments required for the time and materials work will be included.
 b. Hourly Overtime Rate. Half of the equipment rate plus the full estimated hourly operating
 cost. The overtime rate will apply to hours the equipment is used in excess of 10 hours
 per day, either on the Contractor's normal work or on time and materials, and either on
 single or multiple shifts. No markup is allowed.
 c.
 
 Hourly Stand-by Rate. Half of the equipment rate, for equipment ordered on stand-by
 during the Contractor's normal work shift, not to exceed eight hours per day. No operating
 costs or markup is allowed.
 
 d. Unlisted Equipment. For equipment not listed in The Blue Book, the Contractor and the
 Engineer may agree to a rate before extra work is begun. If agreement is not reached,
 the Engineer has authority to establish a rate based on similar equipment in Rental Rate
 Blue Book or prevailing commercial rates. No markup is allowed.
 e. Leased or Rented Equipment. Equipment that must be rented or leased specifically for
 work required under this section and authorized in writing by the Engineer shall be paid at
 invoice price plus 15 percent markup.
 Equipment rented or leased for other work under the Contract and used for work under
 this section shall be paid based on 3.a., b., and c. (above) with no markup, except that
 the adjusted monthly rate is the monthly rate determined directly from the submitted
 rental or lease agreement.
 f.
 
 Transportation of Equipment. The actual cost of moving equipment to and from the work
 site. To receive reimbursement for transportation of equipment, the Contractor shall
 obtain the equipment from the nearest approved source and use the equipment
 exclusively for time and materials work. Payment for move-out will not exceed the
 amount of the move-in. No markup is allowed, except on operator’s wages.
 Basis of payment:
 (1) If by common carrier: paid freight bill or invoice.
 
 75
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 (2) If hauled with the Contractor's own resources: hourly rental rate for hauling unit plus
 operator wages.
 (3) If equipment must be moved under its own power: half of the normal hourly rental
 rate plus operator's wages.
 4. Work by a Subcontractor or Owner-Operator. For time and materials work performed by an
 approved subcontractor or owner-operator under items 1 through 3 above, the Contractor will
 receive a 5 percent markup for administrative costs. No percentage will be paid on work
 covered under bid items in the original Contract. No percentage over the amount covered
 above will be paid for work done by a lower tier subcontractor.
 5. Work by a Specialty Subcontractor. The Contractor shall obtain the Engineer’s advance
 agreement that the specialty item needed is beyond the Contractor's ability or expertise or
 that of the Contractor's other subcontractors. For work on a specialty item performed by an
 approved specialty subcontractor, the Contractor will receive the approved invoice cost of
 work or service plus a 15 percent markup for administrative costs.
 6. Records. The Engineer will maintain a daily record of labor, equipment and materials utilized
 in the extra work. The Engineer will present this record to the Contractor at the end of each
 day's work for verification and signature.
 7. Compensation. Payment for time and materials work will be made in the progress estimate
 following receipt of the verified daily records and all required supporting information from the
 Contractor. If, at any time, a unit price or lump sum basis of compensation is agreed to for
 work being performed under this subsection, that compensation will be set forth in writing as
 a Change Order.
 109-1.06 PROGRESS PAYMENTS. The Department will make monthly progress payments to
 the Contractor based on estimates of the value of work performed and materials on hand under
 Subsection 109-1.07. At the Departments discretion, a progress payment may be made twice
 monthly if the value of the estimate exceeds $10,000.
 Contractor’s failure to pay subcontractors, or subcontractor’s failure to pay lower tier
 subcontractors, according to prompt payment provisions required under Subsection 108-1.01 is
 considered unsatisfactory performance.
 The Department will not withhold payment as retainage but may withhold payment for
 unsatisfactory performance. If satisfactory progress is being made and subcontractors are paid
 according to Subsection 108-1.01 and AS 36.90.210, the Engineer will authorize 100 percent
 payment for the estimated value of work accomplished, less any authorized deductions.
 If the Engineer finds that satisfactory progress is not being made or payment for satisfactory work
 by a subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor is not paid according to Subsection 108-1.01, the
 Engineer may withhold up to 100 percent of the total amount earned from subsequent progress
 payments. The Engineer may withhold up to 200 percent of the estimated cost to complete final
 punch list items for unsatisfactory performance until those items are complete. The Engineer will
 notify the Contractor in writing within eight working days of a request for a progress payment of
 the reasons why part or all of the payment is being withheld for unsatisfactory performance and
 what actions may be taken by the Contractor to receive full payment.
 Payments of withheld amounts will be made in accordance with AS 36.90.200. No interest will be
 paid to the Contractor for amounts withheld for unsatisfactory performance except if the
 Department fails to pay the amount withheld within 21 calendar days after the Contractor
 satisfactorily completes the remedial actions identified by the Engineer, as provided in AS
 36.90.200(e).
 
 76
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 The Contractor shall pay interest on retainage withheld from subcontractors, and at an interest
 rate according to AS 36.90.250 and AS 45.45.010(a).
 109-1.07 PAYMENT FOR MATERIAL ON HAND.
 1. Partial Payment. The Engineer will make partial payment for materials designated for
 incorporation into the work. The material shall:
 a. Meet Contract requirements;
 b. Be delivered and stockpiled at the project or other approved location;
 c.
 
 Be supported by invoices, freight bills, and other required information; and
 
 d. Not be living or perishable.
 2. Payment Requests. The Contractor shall make each payment request in writing and:
 a. List stockpiled items, quantities of each, and stockpile location(s);
 b. Certify that materials meet the applicable Contract specifications;
 c.
 
 For purchased materials, attach copies of invoices, freight bills, and manufacturer’s

 e. Include other information requested by the Engineer.
 3. Storage Conditions. The Contractor shall protect material from damage or loss while in
 storage. The Contractor shall:
 a. Physically separate stockpiled materials from other materials at the storage location;
 b. Clearly label materials with the project name and number; and
 c.
 
 Store materials per the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 If storage conditions become unsatisfactory, liens are filed on any materials, or the storage
 location is changed without approval, the Engineer will deduct any previous payments made
 for such materials.
 4. Method of Payment. The Engineer will include payments for acceptably stockpiled materials
 in the progress estimate following receipt of the Contractor’s written request and all required
 documentation. The Engineer will:
 a. Pay for materials purchased by the Contractor at the delivered cost but not to exceed 85
 percent of the Contract amount for those items;
 b. Pay for materials produced by the Contractor at up to 50 percent of the Contract amount
 for those items;
 c.
 
 Deduct the Department’s cost to inspect materials stored off the limits of the project; and,
 
 d. Deduct partial payment quantities as they are incorporated into the project.
 The Contractor shall release and discharge the Department from any liability for damages or
 delays related to the storage or transport of, and to the payment for, material on hand.
 
 77
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 109
 
 The Department’s payment for material on hand will not constitute final acceptance by the
 Department.
 109-1.08 FINAL PAYMENT. When the project has been completed as provided in Subsection
 105-1.15, the Engineer will prepare the final estimate of the quantities of the various classes of
 work performed. All prior progress estimates and payments shall be subject to correction in the
 final estimate and payment. The final estimate will not be processed until the Alaska Department
 of Labor and Workforce Development has verified that final payment can be released. The
 Department will not process the final estimate until the Contractor completes Items 1 through 4 in
 the first paragraph of Subsection 105-1.16.
 If the Contractor approves the final estimate, or does not file a claim within 90 days of receiving
 the final estimate, the estimate shall be processed for final payment. Final payment shall consist
 of the entire sum found to be due after deducting all previous payments and all amounts to be
 retained or deducted under the provisions of the Contract. Failure to file a claim within 90 days of
 receiving the final estimate is a waiver of any and all claims relating to or arising from the final
 estimate.
 When the Contractor approves the final estimate and executes the Contractor’s Release form,
 final payment will be processed.
 The Contractor may reserve any unresolved claims that were timely filed in accordance with
 Subsection 105-1.17 by listing those claims as exceptions on the Contractor’s Release. Any
 claims listed as exceptions that were not filed before the Contractor executes the final estimate
 will be considered null and void. Any claims filed in a timely manner but not listed on the
 Contractor’s Release are waived and deemed released.
 If the Contractor fails or declines to approve the final estimate within 90 days but does not file any
 claims, the Department will consider the estimate approved and process the estimate for final
 payment. Any subsequently raised claims will be considered null and void.
 109-1.09 ELIMINATED ITEMS. When the Contractor is notified of the elimination of a minor
 Contract item, the Contractor will be reimbursed for actual work performed and all direct costs
 incurred before notification. In no case will any payment be made for loss of anticipated profits or
 overhead.
 Should it become necessary to eliminate a major Contract item, an equitable adjustment will be
 made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly.

 120-1.01 DESCRIPTION. Provide Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs), as defined in
 Title 49 CFR Part 26, the opportunity to participate fairly with other contractors in the performance
 of contracts financed with federal funds. The Contractor and subcontractors shall not discriminate
 on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in the performance of this contract. The
 Contractor will carry out applicable requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and
 administration of U.S. DOT assisted contracts.
 The Department, in coordination with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), adopted a
 Race-Neutral DBE Program with an overall DBE Utilization Goal of 8.46 percent for Alaska’s
 FHWA Federal-Aid program. Although the Race-Neutral program does not establish or require
 individual project DBE Utilization Goals, 49 CFR establishes the Bidder is responsible to make a
 portion of the work available to DBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
 consistent with the available DBEs to facilitate DBE participation.
 If the Department, in collaboration with our contractors, does not meet the overall program DBE
 Utilization Goal and cannot demonstrate good faith effort to meet the program goal, the program
 may be modified to Race-Conscious, with individual DBE Utilization Goals established for each
 Federal-Aid project. The Department and FHWA will use the data collected under Section 120 to
 evaluate the program for compliance with Section 120 and with 49 CFR Part 26.
 120-1.02 INTERPRETATION. This section implements the requirements of 49 CFR Part 26, and
 the Department’s federally approved DBE Program.
 120-1.03 ESSENTIAL CONTRACT PROVISION. Failure to comply with the provisions of this
 section is a material breach of contract, which may result in cancelation of intent to award,
 contract termination, or other remedy as DOT&PF deems appropriate. Failure to comply with this
 section is justification for debarment action as provided in AS 36.30.640(4).

 responsiveness determinations for DBEs and non-DBEs.
 Methods of initial and follow up notification are:
 (1) By fax with a confirmation receipt of successful transmission to the DBE’s fax number
 listed in the DBE Directory. A fax transmission without receipt of successful
 transmission is unsatisfactory.
 (2) By email to the DBE’s email address listed in the DBE Directory, with confirmation of
 successful receipt. Email without confirmation of successful receipt is unsatisfactory.
 (3) By telephone solicitation made to the DBE’s telephone number listed in the DBE
 Directory, with a record of the date and time of the telephone contact. Telephone
 solicitation without a record of date and time is unsatisfactory.
 (4) By publication, with the names and dates of each advertisement in which a request
 for DBE participation was placed. Attach copies of advertisements or proof of
 publication.
 c.
 
 Non-Acceptance of DBE Quotes.
 
 81
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 When a DBE quote is not accepted, the work must be performed by the non-DBE
 subcontractor whose quote was used to provide the basis of the determination or by your
 own forces if your forces were the basis of the determination. Include evidence in
 support of the determination not to use the DBE subcontractor.
 Payments received by a non-DBE subcontractor during the execution of the Contract
 shall be consistent with the accepted quote. This does not preclude increases due to
 change documents issued by the Department.
 d. Assistance to DBEs. Provide DBEs with:
 (1) Information about bonding or insurance required by the bidder.
 (2) Information about securing equipment, supplies, materials, or business development
 related assistance or services.
 (3) Adequate information about the requirements of the contract regarding the specific
 item of work or service sought from the DBE.
 (4) Document all efforts to provide assistance to DBEs on Federal-Aid projects.
 e. Follow-up DBE Notifications. If there is no response from the initial DBE notification,
 contact the DBEs again to determine if they will be quoting.
 Failure to submit a quote by the deadline is evidence of the DBE’s lack of interest in
 bidding. Log follow-up contacts on the Contact Report Form 25A-321A.
 f.
 
 GFE Evaluation. The Department will review the GFE documentation for content but will
 not evaluate sufficiency.
 Failure to provide GFE documentation may result in
 cancellation of the notice of intent to award and forfeiture of the bid security according to
 subsection 103-1.03.
 
 2. Reserved.
 120-3.03 DBE CREDITABLE AND NON CREDITABLE WORK.
 1. DBE Creditable Work. The Commercially Useful Function work items and creditable dollar
 amounts shown on the DBE Utilization Report, Form 25A-325C, shall be included in any
 subcontract, purchase order or service agreement with that DBE.
 2. DBE Decertification.
 a. If a DBE performing a Commercially Useful Function loses its DBE certification at any
 time prior to execution of a subcontract, purchase order or service agreement, as the
 result of a determination of ineligibility pursuant to 49 CFR Part 26.87, the work of that
 firm will not be credited toward the DBE Utilization Goal and the Contractor must either:
 (1) meet the contract goal by subcontracting with an eligible DBE firm or demonstrate a
 GFE to do so; or
 (2) continue with the decertified DBE and find other work not already committed to DBEs
 in an amount that meets or exceeds the DBE Utilization Goal.
 b. If a DBE performing a Commercially Useful Function loses its DBE certification after
 execution of a subcontract, purchase order or service agreement, as the result of a
 determination of ineligibility pursuant to 49 CFR Part 26.87, the de-certified DBE may
 continue to perform, and the work may be credited toward the DBE Utilization Goal.
 
 82
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 c.
 
 If a DBE goes out of business and cannot perform the work, the Contractor must meet
 the contract goal by subcontracting with an eligible DBE Firm or demonstrate a GFE to
 do so.
 The provisions of 120-3.03(3) Termination of a DBE and 120-3.03(4) DBE Replacement
 or Substitution do not apply to this section.
 A Contractor must notify the CRO within one business day if they become aware of any
 change in a DBE’s circumstances that might lead to a DBE’s decertification.
 
 3. Termination of a DBE.
 a. In accordance with 49 CFR 26.53(f)(1) the Contractor shall not terminate a DBE without
 good cause and the prior written consent of the Engineer. For purposes of this
 paragraph, good cause includes the following circumstances:
 (1) DBE defaults on their obligation for any reason;
 (2) The DBE fails or refuses to perform the work of its subcontract in a way consistent
 with normal industry standards. Provided, however, that good cause does not exist if
 the failure or refusal of the DBE to perform its work on the subcontract results from
 the bad faith or discriminatory action of the Contractor.
 (3) The DBE fails or refuses to meet the Contractor’s reasonable, nondiscriminatory
 bond requirements;
 (4) The DBE becomes bankrupt, insolvent, or exhibits credit unworthiness;
 (5) The DBE is ineligible to work on public works projects because of suspension and
 debarment proceedings pursuant 2 CFR Parts 180, 215, and 1,200 or applicable
 state law;
 (6) The Engineer determines the DBE is not a responsible contractor.
 (7) The DBE voluntarily withdraws from the project and provides a written notice of its
 withdrawal;
 (8) The DBE is ineligible to receive DBE credit for the type of work required;
 (9) A DBE owner dies or becomes disabled with the result that the DBE is unable to
 complete its work; or
 (10)Other documented good cause that the Engineer determines, compels the
 termination of the DBE, provided that good cause does not exist if the Contractor
 seeks to terminate a DBE it relied upon to obtain the contract so that the Contractor
 can self-perform the work for which the DBE was engaged or so that the Contractor
 can substitute another DBE or non-DBE after contract award.
 b. The Contractor must give written notice to the DBE of its intent to request to terminate
 and/or substitute, and the reason for the request. The request to terminate and/or
 substitute must be submitted to the Engineer.
 c.
 
 The Contractor must give the DBE 5 working days to respond to the written notice. Any
 response from the DBE must be submitted to the Engineer.
 
 4. DBE Replacement or Substitution.
 
 83
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 a. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a written request to replace or substitute a
 DBE who fails or refuses to execute a written subcontract or who is terminated under
 120-3.03(3).
 b. If the Contractor cannot obtain replacement DBE participation, the DBE Utilization Goal
 will not be adjusted. However, the Engineer may consider the following criteria as
 satisfying that portion of DBE participation that cannot be replaced:
 (1) The Contractor was not at fault or negligent and that the circumstances surrounding
 the replacement or substitution were beyond the control of the Contractor; and
 (2) The Contractor is unable to find replacement DBE participation at the same level of
 DBE commitment and has adequately performed and documented the GFE
 expended in accordance with Subsection 120-3.02; or
 (3) It is too late in the project to provide any real subcontracting opportunities for DBEs.
 If the Engineer agrees that additional DBE participation is not available, the DBE may
 be replaced or substituted with a non-DBE or the Contractor may self-perform the
 work.
 120-3.04 COMMERCIALLY USEFUL FUNCTION (CUF).
 1. Creditable Work. Measuring the DBE Utilization Goal will be based upon the actual dollars
 paid to the DBEs for creditable CUF work on this project. This is determined by the Engineer
 in accordance with this section. CUFs are limited to:
 a. Prime Contractors;
 b. Subcontractors;
 c.
 
 Manufacturers;
 
 d. Regular Dealers;
 e. Brokers; or
 f.
 
 Joint Ventures
 
 2. Determination of CUF. In order for the CUF work of the DBE to be credited toward the goal,
 the Contractor will ensure that the DBE is certified in the appropriate category at the time of
 the submittal of the subcontract, or the issuance of a purchase order or service agreement.
 Subcontracts, purchase orders and service agreements shall be consistent with the written
 DBE commitment.
 a. The CUF performed by a DBE certified in a supply category will be evaluated by the
 Engineer to determine whether the DBE performed as either a broker, regular dealer, or
 manufacturer of the product provided to this project.
 b. The following factors will be used in determining whether a DBE trucking company is
 performing a CUF:
 (1) The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire
 trucking operation for which it is performing on a particular contract, and there cannot
 be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals.
 (2) The DBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and
 operational truck used on the contract.
 
 84
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 (3) The DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services it provides
 on the contract using trucks it owns, insures, and operates using drivers it employs.
 c.
 
 The Contractor will receive credit for the CUF performed by DBEs as provided in this
 Section. Contractors are encouraged to contact the Engineer in advance of the execution
 of the DBE’s work or provision of goods or services regarding CUF and potential DBE
 credit.
 
 d. The DBE may perform work in categories for which it is not certified, but only work
 performed in the DBE’s certified category meeting the CUF criteria may be credited
 toward the DBE Utilization Goal.
 e. DBE work shall conform to the following requirements to be a CUF:
 (1) It will be necessary and useful work required for the execution of the Contract.
 (2) The scope of work will be distinct and identifiable with specific contract items of work,
 bonding, or insurance requirement.
 (3) It will be performed, controlled, managed, and supervised by employees normally
 employed by and under the control of the certified DBE. The work will be performed
 with the DBE’s own equipment. Either the DBE owner or DBE On-Site
 Representative will be at the work site and responsible for the work. Leased
 equipment may also be used provided the DBE has exclusive use of the equipment
 and it is operated by a driver the DBE employs. In remote locations or rare situations,
 a DBE may use equipment and/or personnel from the Contractor or its affiliates.
 Should this situation arise, a prior arrangement must be in place. The duration of the
 arrangement must be short term and prior written approval from the Engineer must
 be obtained.
 (4) The manner in which the work is sublet or performed will conform to standard
 industry practice within Alaska, as determined by the Department. The work or
 provision of goods or services will have a market outside of the DBE program (and
 must also be performed by non-DBE firms within the Alaskan construction industry).
 Otherwise, the work or service will be deemed an unnecessary step in the contracting
 or purchasing process and no DBE credit will be allowed.
 There will be no DBE credit for lower-tier non-DBE subcontract work.
 (5) The cost of the goods and services will be reasonable and competitive with the cost
 of goods and services outside the DBE program within Alaska. Materials or supplies
 needed as a regular course of the Contractor’s operations such as fuel, maintenance,
 office facilities, portable bathrooms, etc. are not creditable.
 The cost of materials actually incorporated into the project by a DBE subcontractor is
 creditable toward the DBE goal only if the DBE is responsible for ordering and
 scheduling their delivery and fully responsible for ensuring that they meet
 specifications. The cost of materials purchased from the contractor or its affiliates is
 not creditable.
 (6) Subcontract work, with the exception of truck hauling, shall be sublet by the same
 unit of measure as is contained in the Bid Schedule unless approved in advance by
 the Engineer.
 (7) The DBE will control all business administration, accounting, billing and payment
 transactions. The Contractor cannot perform these functions for the DBE.
 
 85
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 In accordance with AS 36.30.420(b), the Engineer may inspect the offices of the DBE
 and audit their records to assure compliance.
 3. Rebuttal of a Finding of No CUF. Consistent with the provisions of 49 CFR Part
 26.55(c)(4)&(5), before the Engineer makes a final finding that no CUF has been performed
 by a DBE, the Engineer will coordinate transmittal of the presumptive finding to the
 Contractor, who will in-turn, notify the DBE. The Contractor will provide the DBE the
 opportunity to provide rebuttal information. The Contractor shall present the information to the
 Engineer.
 The Engineer will make a final determination on whether the DBE is performing a CUF.
 Under no circumstances will the Contractor take any action with respect to the DBE until the
 final determination is made. The Engineer’s decisions on CUF matters are subject to review
 by the Department, but are not administratively appealable to the U.S. DOT.
 4. Monthly Required Reporting. On a monthly basis, the Contractor shall submit the Monthly
 th
 Summary of DBE Participation, Form 25A-336, to the Engineer. Reports are due by the 15
 of the following month. Also attach copies of canceled checks or bank statements that identify
 payer, payee, and amount of transfer to verify payment information shown on the form.
 120-4.01 DETERMINING DBE CREDIT. The Contractor is entitled to count toward the DBE
 Utilization Goal, monies actually paid to certified DBEs for CUF work performed by the DBE as
 determined by the Engineer. The Contractor will receive credit toward the DBE Utilization Goal,
 as follows:
 1. Credit for the Commercially Useful Function of a DBE prime contractor is 100 percent of the
 monies actually paid to the DBE under the contract for creditable work and materials in
 accordance with 49 CFR Part 26.55.
 2. Credit for the CUF of a subcontractor is 100 percent of the monies actually paid to the DBE
 under the subcontract for creditable work and materials.
 3. Credit for the CUF of a subcontractor performing hauling/transportation is 100 percent of the
 monies actually paid to the DBE under the subcontract for creditable work for those firms
 certified in the 100 percent category. Credit for the CUF of a subcontractor performing
 hauling/transportation is 5 percent of the monies actually paid to the DBE under the
 subcontract for creditable work for those firms certified in the 5 percent credit category.
 4. Credit for the CUF of a manufacturer is 100 percent of the monies paid to the DBE for the
 creditable materials manufactured.
 5. Credit for the CUF of a regular dealer of a creditable material, product, or supply is 60
 percent of its value. The value is the actual cost paid to the DBE not to exceed the bid price
 for such item.
 6. Credit for the CUF of a broker performed by a DBE certified in a supply category for providing
 a creditable material, product or supply is limited to a reasonable brokerage fee. The
 brokerage fee will not exceed 5 percent of the cost of the procurement contract for the
 creditable item.
 7. Credit for the CUF of a broker performed by a DBE certified in a bonding or insurance
 category is limited to a reasonable brokerage fee, not to exceed 5 percent of the premium
 cost.
 8. Credit for the CUF of a joint venture (JV) either as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor
 may not exceed the percent of the DBE’s participation in the JV agreement, as certified by
 
 86
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 120
 
 the CRO. The DBE joint venture partner will be responsible for performing all of the work as
 delineated in the certified JV agreement.
 120-5.01 ACHIEVEMENT OF DBE GOALS. Work under this item is subsidiary to other contract
 items and no payment will be made for meeting or exceeding the DBE Utilization Goal.
 If the Contractor fails to utilize the DBEs listed on Form 25A-325C as scheduled or fails to submit
 proof of payment, requested documentation, or otherwise cooperate with a DBE review or
 investigation, the Department will consider this to be unsatisfactory work. If the Contractor fails to
 utilize GFE to replace or substitute a DBE, regardless of fault [except for Subsection 1203.03(4)(b)(3)], the Department will also consider this unsatisfactory work. Unsatisfactory work
 may result in disqualification of the Contractor from future bidding under Subsection 102-1.13 and
 withholding or progress payments consistent with Subsection 109-1.06.

 1. Unclassified Excavation. All materials of whatever character encountered in the work. May
 include rock, common, or muck.
 2. Classified Excavation.
 a. Common Excavation. Silt, sand, gravel, and granular material other than rock or muck.
 b. Rock Excavation. Rock that cannot be excavated without blasting or ripping.
 c.
 
 Muck Excavation. Soils, organic matter, and other material not suitable for foundation
 material regardless of moisture content.
 
 3. Borrow. Approved material required for embankments or for other portions of the work, and
 obtained from sources outside the right-of-way limits for the project.
 4. Rock Stabilization Materials. As specified on the Plans or Special Provisions.
 5. Rockfall Mitigation Materials. As specified on the Plans or Special Provisions.
 6. Crushed Glass: May be combined with soil-aggregate material to be used in embankment
 construction. Meet 703-2.15 requirements.
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 203-3.01 GENERAL. Perform all necessary clearing and grubbing prior to beginning excavation,
 grading, and embankment operations in any area.
 Keep excavation and embankment areas free draining at all times as the work progresses. Finish
 the excavation and embankments to reasonably smooth and uniform surfaces.
 Excavate and embank material only within the limits on the Plans or as directed. Prevent
 disturbing material and vegetation outside of the slope limits.
 The Engineer may designate excavated soils, that cannot be properly compacted in
 embankments, as unsuitable.
 When unsuitable material is encountered at the required depth of excavation, remove the
 unsuitable material to the depth specified or directed. Allow for measurements to be taken before
 backfill is placed.
 Dispose of unsuitable material or excess usable material at approved locations.
 Obtain the property owner’s written permission to dispose of unsuitable material or excess usable
 material at locations outside the right-of-way limits and a waiver of all claims against the State for
 any damage to such land which may result. Obtain all permits required by law for such disposal.
 Furnish a copy of such permission, waiver of claims, and permits to the Engineer before
 commencing work.
 
 93
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 203
 
 Ensure that all disposal areas are properly graded and drained. Blend the outer limits of
 unsuitable material into surrounding grounds with no noticeable break or variation readily
 discernible. When existing roadway embankment slopes are used as disposal sites for unsuitable
 or excess useable material, finish the slopes with a motor grader or other approved method.
 When the volume of suitable excavation is not sufficient for constructing the fill to the grades
 indicated, furnish the necessary borrow from approved sources. Borrow may be necessary even
 though not shown on the Plans. The source and acceptability of the borrow is subject to approval.
 Do not place borrow material until after the usable roadway excavation has been placed in the fill.
 If you place more borrow than is required, resulting in or as a result of the unnecessary disposal
 of usable excavation, the amount of such disposed material will be deducted from the borrow
 quantity.
 Obliteration of Roadways includes all grading operations necessary to incorporate the existing
 roadway into the new roadway and surroundings in order to provide a pleasing appearance from
 the new roadway. Fill ditches not required for drainage and grade to the approximate original
 ground contour.
 Do not place soil-aggregate containing glass cullet:
 1.
 
 Within four feet from the face of any embankment slope,
 
 2.
 
 Within 150 feet from any surface water body,
 
 3.
 
 In embankment areas where culvert placement is required,
 
 4.
 
 In contact with any geosynthetic material.
 
 203-3.02 ROCK EXCAVATION. Excavate rock by blasting, ripping, or both.
 Unless Subgrade Blasting is specified, excavate material which would classify as rock within the
 limits of the roadbed to a minimum depth of 6 inches below subgrade.
 1. Blasting.
 a. Blasting Plan. Prior to commencement of drilling, submit a Blasting Plan prepared by a
 qualified Blaster. Include the details of test blasting, controlled blasting and production
 blasting. Include station limits, date and time of each blast, layout details of each blast,
 trade names, types and sizes of explosives and accessories, delay sequences of the
 blast holes, and powder factors. Submit a revised Blasting Plan any time there is a
 change in the drilling or blasting methods.
 b. Blaster. Use a qualified blaster licensed or otherwise authorized under all applicable
 federal, state and local laws or regulations to possess, transport, store and use
 explosives of the type used on the Project. Provide the Blaster’s resume and copies of all
 applicable licenses to the Engineer with the Blasting Plan. Have the Blaster on site during
 all loading and blasting operations. Require the Blaster to take responsible charge for
 safety procedures as set forth below and to maintain a detailed record for each day of
 blasting work.
 c.
 
 Pre-Blast Conference. Hold a pre-blasting meeting at the jobsite prior to commencement
 of any drilling and blasting operations with the Contractor, the Blaster and representatives
 of the Engineer. Discuss the Blasting Plan and visit such specific sites as are necessary
 to familiarize the participants with the details of the blasting operations.
 
 94
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 203
 
 d. Safety. Submit a Safety Plan that includes descriptions of road closures, warning signals,
 and plans for notification of affected local, state, and federal agencies. Discuss in the
 Safety Plan methods for protection of life and health, public and private property, new
 work or existing work on the project, nearby structures, wetlands, waters and wildlife.
 Hold a safety meeting prior to commencement of blasting operations to address safety
 issues.
 e. Controlled Blasting. Controlled blasting holes are closely spaced, lightly loaded holes
 drilled along the plane of the final design slope. Controlled blasting is either preshear
 blasting with holes detonated before the production blasting or cushion (trim) blasting
 with holes detonated after the production blasting. Drill holes parallel to each other and
 within 12 inches of the staked slope plane. Use controlled blasting techniques for all rock
 slopes higher than 10 feet to produce a stable cut face sheared along the designed neat
 excavation line. If at any time during the progress of the work, the approved methods of
 blasting and drilling fail to produce the desired result of a smooth, stable backslope,
 modify the blasting method to achieve the desired result. Do not construct benches in
 finished rock back slopes unless approved by the Engineer. The Engineer may permit an
 offset for drilling equipment clearances. Do not use ANFO in controlled blasting holes.
 f.
 
 Production Blasting. Use materials and methods as necessary to fragment and loosen
 the rock inside the design excavation limits, while leaving a smooth, stable back slope
 using the controlled blasting methods set forth above. Use appropriately designed delay
 sequences and charge weights per delay to minimize ground vibrations and prevent
 damage to buildings, structures, utilities, sensitive fish or wildlife habitat and other
 facilities. Prior to blasting, remove all loose objects, and render safe all dangerous
 conditions, in or near the cut slope area. Detonate production hole charges in a delay
 sequence toward the free face. Remove and dispose of loose material from rock slope
 failures or slides at the contract price for unclassified excavation if the Engineer
 determines the failure did not occur as a result of the Contractor’s methods. The
 Engineer will determine the amount of loose material at the time of removal.
 
 g. Scaling. Remove all loose, hanging, or potentially dangerous rock from newly excavated
 slopes and from surrounding existing slopes as the excavation progresses to ensure the
 rock slopes are stable. Do not commence work on subsequent lifts or shots until scaling
 is complete. Accomplish scaling with hand tools, hydraulic splitters, machine scaling with
 excavators or other equipment, high pressure water spray, light explosive charges, or
 other approved methods.
 h. Ditch Line/Subgrade Blasting. Construct a free-draining fractured rock zone below the
 ditch line and the bottom of the structural section as shown on the Plans and
 Specifications or as directed. Blast or rip rock below the bottom profile of the ditch line
 and below the bottom of the structural section to depths as indicated or directed.
 2. Stabilization. Stabilize excavated or existing rock surfaces with rock bolts, rock dowels,
 shotcrete, or other techniques, as indicated in the Plans and Specifications or as directed.
 The Engineer may increase or decrease the extent and type of stabilization methods
 depending on the geologic conditions encountered during the work. Obtain approval from the
 Engineer for rock bolts, dowels, shotcrete, resin grout, cement grout, mortar, and other
 stabilization accessories prior to ordering the items. Conduct performance testing as required
 by the Engineer to confirm the stabilization methods and equipment produce the required
 capacities and functions.
 3. Rockfall Mitigation. Use rockfall mitigation methods such as rock catchment fences, wire
 mesh draping, flexible or rigid barriers, ditch width modification, and other techniques to
 intercept rockfall and control it before it reaches the roadway or other facilities. Construct
 according to the Plans and Specifications or as required by the Engineer. The Engineer may
 increase or decrease the extent and type of mitigation methods depending on the geologic
 
 95
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 203
 
 conditions encountered during the work. Obtain approval from the Engineer for fence
 material, wire mesh, barrier design and accessories prior to ordering the items. Conduct
 performance testing as required by the Engineer to confirm the methods and equipment
 produce the required capacities and functions.
 4. Drain Holes. Drill drain holes in rock slopes to relieve excess water pressure as specified or
 directed. The Engineer will determine the location and construction details of the drain holes,
 depending on the conditions encountered in each slope.
 203-3.03 EMBANKMENT CONSTRUCTION. Prepare the areas upon which embankments are to
 be placed, construct dikes within or outside the right-of-way when required, place and compact
 approved material within the roadway areas where unsuitable material has been removed, and
 place and compact embankment material in holes, pits, and other depressions within the roadway
 area. Use only approved materials in the construction of embankments and backfills.
 Embankment material will be approved for gradation following placement but prior to compaction.
 Construct the embankment with selected material meeting the requirements of Subsection 7032.07. Selected material may be obtained from unclassified excavation, rock excavation, common
 excavation or borrow.
 Do not place rocks, broken concrete or other solid materials in embankment areas where piling is
 to be placed or driven, or where culvert placement is required.
 Bench slopes that are steeper than 4:1, when measured at right angles to the roadway, when
 embankment is to be placed and compacted on hillsides, or when new embankment is to be
 compacted against existing embankments, or when embankment is built half-width at a time.
 Continuously bench over those areas as the work is brought up in layers. Make benches wide
 enough to permit placing and compacting operations. Begin each horizontal cut at the intersection
 of the original ground and the vertical side of the previous bench. Incorporate material cut out,
 and deemed suitable, into the new embankment and recompact along with the new material.
 Scarify existing roadways, lying within 3 feet of subgrade, to a depth of 6 inches and recompact to
 meet Subsection 203-3.04 or 203-3.05.
 When permanently frozen soils are encountered, place backfill or embankment materials in a
 timely manner, as directed, to minimize degradation of the foundation material. Do not place
 embankment over seasonally frozen ground unless authorized in writing.
 Thaw and drain frozen material deemed acceptable for fill before placing in the embankment.
 Frozen cuts may require stage excavation: remove thawed material and allow the cut to thaw
 while work continues on some other portions of the project. After the material in the cut has
 thawed to a sufficient depth, remove the thawed material. Repeat this operation until all frozen
 material is removed or the cut is excavated to grade.
 When excavation is performed when freezing weather is imminent, place the specified backfill
 promptly, following the excavation work, at least up to a level which will allow the surface to
 adequately drain. Make arrangements for the timely availability of such embankment or backfill
 materials prior to commencement of the stripping or excavation operations, when required.
 If embankment can be deposited on one side only of abutments, wing walls, piers or culvert
 headwalls, prevent the overturning of or excessive pressure against the structure. Do not place
 the fill adjacent to the abutment of a bridge higher than the bottom of the backwall of the
 abutment until the superstructure is in place. When embankment is to be placed on both sides of
 a concrete wall or box type structure, keep the embankment at approximately the same elevation
 on both sides of the structure.
 
 96
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 203
 
 Place roadway embankment of earth materials in horizontal layers not to exceed 8 inches
 (uncompacted) for the full width of the embankment, except as required for traffic, and compact
 as specified before the next layer is placed. Use spreading equipment on each lift to obtain
 uniform thickness prior to compacting. Maintain uniform density, during compaction. Add or
 remove water, as necessary, to obtain the required density. Route compaction equipment
 uniformly over the entire surface of each layer.
 Place rock embankment in lifts not thinner than the thickness of the largest rocks. Restrict
 maximum rock dimension to 3 feet. Distribute spalls and finer rock fragments to level and smooth
 each lift. Place succeeding lifts without damaging previously completed lifts. Dump rock on the lift
 being constructed and distribute by blading or dozing to fill voids and to form a dense, wellcompacted embankment. Do not place rocks over 8 inches within 2 feet of finished subgrade.
 Rock is considered usable material, regardless of size. Rocks too large to be embanked, as
 specified above, may either be reduced to a suitable size for incorporation into the embankment
 or disposed of in approved areas, at your option. Replace all wasted rock from excavation with
 borrow at no additional cost to the Department, unless such rock is excess to project
 embankment requirements.
 Finish the subgrade surface so it will not vary more than 0.10 foot when tested using a 10-foot
 straightedge nor vary more than 0.10 ft from the established grade.
 When embankment is to be placed over swampy or saturated ground, end dump an initial lift of
 material of sufficient depth to support hauling equipment, as directed.
 Repair damage to embankment caused by hauling equipment.
 Construct all embankments with moisture and density control unless the Engineer determines
 that such controls are not feasible.
 Temporary surcharging consists of two methods:
 1. Static Surcharge. Leave surcharge in place until the foundation material has reached stability
 or the required settlement has taken place.
 2. Rolling Surcharge. Construct a surcharge on top of the embankment to the specified
 elevation and continually advance the surcharge as the embankment is constructed ahead.
 Use material removed from the temporary surcharge in areas indicated on the Plans. Do not
 dispose of temporary surcharge material without written approval. Compaction is not required for
 material placed in a temporary surcharge.
 203-3.04 COMPACTION WITH MOISTURE AND DENSITY CONTROL. The maximum density
 and optimum moisture will be determined by ATM 207 or ATM 212.
 Adjust the moisture content of the embankment material to within 2 percent of the optimum
 moisture content and compact each layer to not less than 95 percent of the maximum density.
 Acceptance densities will be determined by ATM 213 and ATM 214.
 203-3.05 COMPACTION WITHOUT MOISTURE AND DENSITY CONTROL. Except for rock fills
 and the first layer of fills over swampy ground, deposit embankment materials in layers not
 exceeding 8 inches in thickness before compaction.
 Compact by routing construction equipment and/or rollers uniformly over the entire surface of
 each layer before the next layer is placed. Compact until embankment does not rut under the
 loaded hauling equipment.
 
 97

 a. Process for daily inspections
 b. Means and methods to remove and dispose of project materials
 401-3.02 CONTRACTOR QUALITY CONTROL. Perform quality control (QC) of HMA materials
 in accordance with Subsection 106-1.03.
 401-3.03 WEATHER LIMITATIONS. Place HMA on a stable/non-yielding roadbed. Do not place
 HMA when the base material is wet or frozen, or when weather conditions prevent proper
 handling or finishing of the mix. Do not place HMA leveling course when the roadway surface
 temperature is colder than 40° F.
 401-3.04 EQUIPMENT, GENERAL. Use equipment in good working order and free of HMA
 buildup. Make all equipment available for inspection and demonstration of operation a minimum
 of 24 hours before placement of HMA.
 401-3.05 ASPHALT MIXING PLANT. Meet AASHTO M 156. Use an HMA plant capable of
 producing at least 150 tons of HMA per hour noted on posted DEC air quality permit, designed to
 dry aggregates, maintain consistent and accurate temperature control, and accurately proportion
 asphalt binder and aggregates. Calibrate the HMA plant and furnish copies of the calibration data
 to the Engineer at least 24 hours before HMA production.
 Provide a scalping screen at the asphalt plant to prevent oversize material or debris from being
 incorporated into the HMA.
 Provide a tap on the asphalt binder supply line just before it enters the plant (after the 3-way
 valve) for sampling asphalt binder. Provide aggregate and asphalt binder sampling locations
 meeting OSHA safety requirements.
 You may use belt conveyor scales to proportion plant blends and mixtures if the scales meet the
 general requirements for weighing equipment and are calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
 instructions.
 If WMA is approved by the Engineer, modify the mixing plant as required by the manufacturer and
 WMA additive manufacturer.
 401-3.06 HAULING EQUIPMENT. Haul HMA in trucks with tight, clean, smooth metal beds.
 Keep beds free of petroleum oils, solvents, or other materials that would adversely affect the
 mixture. Apply a thin coat of approved asphalt release agent to beds as necessary to prevent
 mixture adherence. Provide trucks with covers attached and available for use.
 Do not haul HMA on barges.
 401-3.07 ASPHALT PAVERS. Use self-propelled asphalt pavers with heated vibratory screed
 assemblies to spread and finish HMA to the specified section widths and thicknesses without
 introducing thermal or material segregation.
 Equip the paver with a receiving hopper having sufficient capacity for a uniform spreading
 operation and a distribution system to place the HMA uniformly in front of screed. Use a screed
 assembly that produces a finished surface of the required smoothness, thickness and texture
 without tearing, shoving or displacing the HMA. Heat and vibrate screed extensions. Place auger
 extensions within 20 inches of the screed extensions or per written manufacturer’s
 recommendations.
 Equip the paver with a means of preventing segregation of the coarse aggregate particles from
 the remainder of the HMA when carried from the paver hopper back to the augers.
 
 123
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 Equip the paver with automatic screed controls capable of operating from a reference line or a
 ski from either or both sides of the paver.
 The use of a “Layton Box” or equivalent towed paver is allowed on bike paths, sidewalks, and
 driveways.
 401-3.08 ROLLERS. Use rollers designed to compact HMA and capable of reversing without
 shoving or tearing the mixture. Select rollers that will not crush the aggregate or displace the
 HMA. Equip vibratory rollers with separate vibration and propulsion controls.
 Equip the rollers with an infrared thermometer that measures and displays the surface
 temperature to the operator. Infrared thermometer may be hand-held or fixed to the roller.
 Utilize a pneumatic roller in the complement of rollers to compact the leveling course. Use fully
 skirted pneumatic-tire roller having a minimum operating weight of 3000 pounds per tire.
 401-3.09 RESERVED.
 401-3.10 PREPARATION OF EXISTING SURFACE. Prepare existing surfaces according to the
 Contract. Prior to placing HMA, clean existing surfaces of loose material and uniformly coat
 contact surfaces of curbing, gutters, manholes and other structures with tack coat material
 meeting Section 402. Treat cold joint surfaces according to 401-3.17.
 Before applying tack coat to an existing paved surface, clean and patch the surface. Remove
 irregularities to provide a reasonably smooth and uniform surface. Remove and replace unstable
 areas with HMA. Clean the edges of existing pavements, which are to be adjacent to new
 pavement, to permit the adhesion of asphalt materials. Clean loose material from cracks. Fill the
 cleaned cracks, wider than 1 inch, with HMA tamped in place. Wash and/or sweep the paved
 surface clean and free of loose materials.
 Preparation of a milled surface:
 1. Prelevel remaining ruts, pavement delaminations, and depressions having a depth greater
 than 1/2 inch with an approved HMA.
 2. Notify the Engineer of pavement areas that appear thin or unstable. Where milling operation
 creates thin or unstable pavement areas, or where it breaks through existing pavement,
 remove thin and unstable pavement, and 2 inches of existing base material, compact and
 replace with an approved HMA.
 401-3.11 PREPARATION OF ASPHALT. Provide a continuous supply of asphalt binder to the
 asphalt mixing plant at a uniform temperature, within the recommended mixing temperature
 range.
 401-3.12 PREPARATION OF AGGREGATES. Dry the aggregate so the moisture content of the
 HMA, sampled at the point of acceptance for asphalt binder content, does not exceed 0.5 percent
 (by total weight of mix), as determined by ATM 407.
 Heat the aggregate for the HMA to a temperature compatible with the mix requirements specified.
 Adjust the burner on the dryer to avoid damage to the aggregate and to prevent the presence of
 unburned fuel on the aggregate. HMA containing soot or fuel is unacceptable per Subsection
 105-1.11.
 401-3.13 MIXING. Combine the aggregate, asphalt binder, and additives in the mixer in the
 amounts required by the JMD. Mix to obtain at least 98 percent coated particles when tested
 according to AASHTO T195.
 
 124
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 For batch plants, put the dry aggregate in motion before addition of asphalt binder.
 Mix the HMA within the temperature range determined by the JMD.
 Upon the Engineer’s request, provide daily burner charts showing start/stop times and
 temperatures.
 401-3.14 TEMPORARY STORAGE OF HMA. Silo type storage bins may be used, provided the
 characteristics of the HMA remain unaltered.
 Signs of visible segregation, heat loss, changes from the JMD, change in the characteristics of
 asphalt binder, lumpiness, and stiffness of the mixture, are causes for rejection.
 Do not store HMA on barges.
 401-3.15 PLACING AND SPREADING. Use asphalt pavers to distribute HMA, including leveling
 course and temporary HMA. Place the HMA upon the approved surface, spread, strike off, and
 adjust surface irregularities. The maximum compacted lift thickness allowed is 3 inches.
 When multiple lifts are specified in the Contract, do not place the final lift until all lower lifts
 throughout that section, are placed and accepted.
 Do not place HMA abutting curb and gutter until curb and gutter are installed, except as approved
 by the Engineer.
 Do not pave against new Portland cement concrete curbing until it has cured for at least 72 hours.
 When practicable, adjust elevation of metal fixtures before paving the final lift, so they will be
 between 1/4 and 1/2 inch below the top surface of the final lift. Metal fixtures include, but are not
 limited to manholes, valve boxes, monument cases, hand holes, and drains.
 Use hand tools to spread, rake, and lute the HMA in areas where irregularities or unavoidable
 obstacles make mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impracticable.
 Place HMA over bridge deck membranes according to Section 508 and the membrane
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 Do not mix HMA produced from different plants for testing or paving.
 401-3.16 COMPACTION. Thoroughly and uniformly, compact the HMA by rolling. In areas not
 accessible to large rollers, compact with mechanical tampers or trench rollers.
 The Lower Specification Limit for density is 92.0 percent of the Maximum Specific Gravity (MSG)
 as determined by ATM 409. The MSG from the approved JMD is used for the first lot of each
 type of HMA. The MSG for additional lots is determined from the first sublot of each lot.
 401-3.17 JOINTS. Place and compact the HMA to provide a continuous bond, texture, and
 smoothness between adjacent sections of the HMA.
 Minimize the number of joints. Do not construct longitudinal joints in the driving lanes unless
 approved by the Engineer in writing at the pre-paving meeting. Offset the longitudinal joints in
 one layer from the joint in the layer immediately below by at least 6 inches. Align the joints of the
 top layer at the centerline or lane lines. Where preformed marking tape striping is required, offset
 the longitudinal joint in the top layer not more than 6 inches from the edge of the stripe.
 Form transverse joints by saw-cutting back on the previous run to expose the full depth of the
 course or by using a removable bulkhead. Skew transverse joints 15 to 25 degrees.
 
 125
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 For all joints below the top lift, uniformly coat joint surfaces with tack coat material meeting
 Section 402.
 When Item 401(14) appears in the bid schedule, uniformly coat the joint face of all top lift joints
 with a joint adhesive. Otherwise use tack coat material meeting Section 402. Follow joint
 adhesive manufacturer’s recommendations for temperatures and application method. Remove
 joint adhesive applied to the top of pavement surface.
 If infrared joint heaters are used and passing joint densities are achieved in each of the first three
 joint densities taken, then joint adhesive is not required.
 The Lower Specification Limit for top lift longitudinal joint density is 91.0 percent of the MSG of
 the panel completing the joint. MSG will be determined according to ATM 409. Top lift
 longitudinal joints will be evaluated for acceptance according to Subsection 401-4.03.
 When the longitudinal joint density test result for a top lift panel sublot is less than 91.0 percent,
 seal the surface of all longitudinal joints within that sublot using a joint sealant meeting
 Subsection 702-2.06.Apply joint sealant according to the manufacturer’s recommendations while
 the HMA is clean, free of moisture and prior to final traffic marking. Place the sealant at a
 maximum application rate of 0.15 gallons per square yard, and at least 12 inches wide centered
 on the longitudinal joint. After surface sealing, inlay by grinding pavement striping into the sealed
 HMA. Use grooving equipment that grinds a dry cut to groove the width, length, and thickness of
 the striping within the specified striping tolerances.
 Correct improperly formed joints that result in surface irregularities according to a corrective
 action plan.
 Joints formed by paving in echelon while the mat temperature is over 200 degrees F as
 measured by the Engineer, within three inches of the joint, do not require tack coat and joint
 adhesive, and will receive the full longitudinal joint density price adjustment incentive without
 testing for joint density.
 401-3.18 SURFACE REQUIREMENTS AND TOLERANCES. The finished surface of all HMA
 paving must match dimensions shown in the contract for horizontal alignment and width, profile
 grade and elevation, crown slope, and pavement thickness. Water must drain across the
 pavement surface without ponding. The surface must have a uniform texture, without ridges,
 puddles, humps, depressions, and roller marks. The surface must not exhibit raveling, cracking,
 tearing, asphalt bleeding, or aggregate segregation. Leave no foreign material, uncoated
 aggregate or oversize aggregate on the HMA surface.
 The Engineer will test the finished surface after final rolling at selected locations using a 10-foot
 straightedge. Measurements will include spanning joints. The Engineer will identify pavement
 areas that deviate more than 3/16 inch from the straightedge, including joints, as defective work.
 Perform corrective work by removing and replacing, grinding, cold milling or infrared heating such
 areas as required. Do not surface patch. After the Contractor performs corrective work, the
 Engineer will retest the area.
 If bid item Pavement Smoothness Price Adjustment appears in the contract, the Engineer will use
 an inertial profiler to measure the top lift HMA surface in the driving lanes for surface smoothness
 within 21 days after paving is complete and driving lanes are delineated.
 Profiler measurements will be taken on through lanes identified in the contract. Profiler
 measurements will not be taken in turn lanes, intersections, ramps, lane transitions, or within 25
 feet of bridge abutments and transverse joints with pre-existing pavement.
 
 126
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 The Engineer will measure the pavement smoothness in both wheel paths of each lane. The
 smoothness is measured as International Roughness Index (IRI), reported as inches/mile, at 0.1
 mile increments. Pavement smoothness is the average of all IRI measurements for the project.
 The Engineer will identify areas requiring corrective action in accordance with Table 401-4.
 Perform full-width corrective action in those areas. The Engineer may waive corrective work for
 localized roughness for deficiencies resulting from manholes or other similar appurtenances near
 the wheel path.
 Perform Corrective Actions according to one of the following or by a method approved by the
 Engineer:
 1. Diamond Grinding. If the required pavement thickness is not decreased by more than 0.25”,
 grind to the required surface tolerance and cross section. Remove and dispose of all
 materials resulting from the grinding process. Apply joint sealant and sand to exposed
 aggregates per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 2. Overlaying. Mill or sawcut the existing pavement to provide a vertical transverse joint face to
 match the overlay to the existing pavement. Apply tack coat on the milled surface and joint
 adhesive to all vertical joints and overlay the full width of the underlying pavement surface.
 Use the same approved HMA for overlays. Place a minimum overlay thickness of 2.0 inches.
 3. Mill and Fill. Mill the existing pavement to provide a vertical transverse joint face. Apply tack
 coat to the milled surface and joint adhesive to all vertical joints prior to inlay new HMA to
 match the existing pavement. Use the same approved HMA. Place a minimum thickness of
 2.0 inches.
 After completion of corrective work, the Engineer will measure the pavement surface with an
 inertial profiler for a smoothness price adjustment.
 Price adjustments for pavement smoothness will be calculated according to Subsection 4014.03.3.
 401-3.19 REPAIRING DEFECTIVE AREAS. Remove HMA that is contaminated with foreign
 material, is segregated (determined visually or by testing), flushing, or bleeding asphalt. Remove
 and dispose defective HMA for the full thickness of the course. Cut the pavement so that edges
 are vertical and the sides are parallel to the direction of traffic. Coat edges with a tack coat
 according to Section 402. Place and compact fresh HMA so that compaction, grade and
 smoothness requirements are met.
 401-3.20 ROADWAY MAINTENANCE. Inspect daily according to pavement inspection plan.
 Remove, and dispose of project materials incorrectly deposited on existing and new pavement
 surfaces(s) inside and outside the project area including haul routes.
 The Contractor is responsible for damage caused by not removing these materials and any
 damage to the roadway from the removal method(s).
 Repair damage to the existing roadway that results from fugitive materials or their removal.
 401-4.01 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. Section 109 and the following:
 1. Hot Mix Asphalt.
 a. By weight. No deduction is made for the weight of asphalt binder or anti stripping
 additive or cutting back joints. If the use of WMA is approved by the Engineer, WMA
 additives will not be measured and are considered subsidiary to the HMA pay item.
 
 127
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 b. By the final HMA surface area.
 2
 
 Asphalt Binder. By weight, as follows:
 Method 1 will be used for determining asphalt binder quantity unless otherwise directed in
 writing. The procedure initially used will be the one used for the duration of the project. No
 payment is made for any asphalt binder more than 0.4 percent above the optimum asphalt
 binder content specified in the JMD.
 Method 1: Percent of asphalt binder for each sublot multiplied by the total HMA weight
 represented by that sublot. The Engineer will use either ATM 405 or ATM 406 to determine
 the percent of asphalt binder. The same test method used for the acceptance testing of the
 sublot will be used for computation of the asphalt binder quantity. In the absence of testing,
 the percent of asphalt binder is the target value for asphalt binder in the JMD.
 Method 2: Supplier's invoices minus waste, diversion and remnant. This procedure is an
 Engineer’s option for projects where deliveries are made in tankers and the asphalt plant is
 producing HMA for one project only.
 The Engineer may direct, at any time that tankers are weighed in the Engineer’s presence
 before and after unloading. If the weight determined at the project varies more than 1 percent
 from the invoice amount, payment is based on the weight determined at the project.
 Any remnant or diversion will be calculated based on tank stickings or weighing the remaining
 asphalt binder. The Engineer will determine the method. The weight of asphalt binder in
 disposed HMA is calculated using the target value for asphalt binder as specified in the JMD.
 
 3. Job Mix Design. When specified, a Contractor furnished JMD is measured as one according
 to the HMA class and type.
 4. Temporary Pavement. By weight, without deduction for the weight of asphalt binder or antistrip additive.
 5. Leveling Course. By Lane-Station (12 foot width) or by weighing without deduction for the
 weight of asphalt binder or anti-strip additive.
 6. HMA Price Adjustment. Calculated by quality level analysis under Subsection 401-4.03.1.
 7. Longitudinal Joint Density Price Adjustment. By the linear foot of top lift longitudinal joint
 under Subsection 401-4.03.2.
 8. Joint Adhesive. By the linear foot of longitudinal and transverse joint.
 9. Pavement Smoothness Price Adjustment. Calculated from inertial profiler data using
 FHWA’s ProVAL software under Subsection 401-4.03.3.
 10. Asphalt Material Price Adjustment. Determined under Subsection 401-4.04.
 11. Liquid Anti-Strip Additive. Based on the number of tons of asphalt binder containing required
 additive.
 12. Crack Repair. From end to end of the crack repaired according to 401-3.10, measured
 horizontally along the centerline of the crack. Cleaning loose material from cracks, asphalt
 binder, and HMA to fill cracks will not be measured separately but are subsidiary.
 
 128
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 13. Prelevel for Ruts, Delaminations, and Depressions. By the surface area where prelevel is
 placed according to 401-3.10(1), measured according to Section 109. Asphalt binder, HMA,
 and cleaning loose material, will not be measured separately but are subsidiary.
 14. Repair Unstable Pavement. By the surface area of pavement repaired according to 4013.10(2), measured according to Section 109. Asphalt binder, HMA, and removal of pavement
 and base course will not be measured separately but are subsidiary.
 401-4.02 ACCEPTANCE SAMPLING AND TESTING. The bid quantity of each type of HMA
 produced and placed will be divided into lots and the lots evaluated individually for acceptance.
 A lot is normally 5,000 tons. The lot is divided into sublots of 500 tons, each randomly sampled
 and tested for asphalt binder content, density, and gradation according to this Subsection. The lot
 is evaluated for price adjustment according to Subsection 401-4.03.1. Seasonal startup or a new
 JMD requires starting a new lot.
 If less than 8 sublots have been placed at the time a lot is terminated, the material in the
 shortened lot will be included as part of the prior lot. The price adjustment computed for the prior
 lot will include the samples from the shortened lot. If there is no prior lot, and there are at least 3
 sublots, the material in the shortened lot will be considered as a lot and the price adjustment will
 be based on the actual number of test results in the shortened lot. If there are less than 3 sublots,
 the HMA will be accepted for payment based on the Engineer’s approval of the JMD, and
 placement and compaction of the HMA to the specified depth, finished surface requirements and
 tolerances. The Engineer reserves the right to perform any testing required in order to determine
 acceptance.
 If 8 or 9 sublots have been placed at the time a lot is terminated, they will be considered as a lot
 and the price adjustment will be based on the actual number of test results in the shortened lot
 If the bid quantity is between 1,500 to 4,999 tons, the quantity is considered one lot. The lot is
 divided into sublots of 500 tons, each randomly sampled and tested for asphalt binder content,
 density, and gradation according to this Subsection. The lot is evaluated for price adjustment
 according to Subsection 401-4.03.1.
 For bid quantity less than 1,500 tons, HMA will be accepted for payment based on the Engineer’s
 approval of the JMD, and placement and compaction of the HMA to the specified depth, finished
 surface requirements and tolerances. The Engineer reserves the right to perform any testing
 required in order to determine acceptance.
 Sampling and testing include the following:
 1. Asphalt Binder Content. HMA samples shall be taken randomly by the Contractor in the
 presence of the Engineer from behind the paver screed before initial compaction, or will be
 taken randomly by the Engineer from the windrow, according to ATM 402 or ATM 403, at the
 discretion of the Engineer. The location (behind the paver screed or windrow) will be
 determined at the pre-paving meeting. Random sampling locations will be determined by the
 Engineer.
 Two separate samples will be taken, one for acceptance testing and one held in reserve for
 retesting if requested. Asphalt binder content will be determined according to ATM 405 or
 ATM 406, at the discretion of the Engineer.
 2. Aggregate Gradation. Aggregates tested for gradation acceptance will have the full
 tolerances from Table 401-2 applied.
 a. Drum Mix Plants. Samples will be taken from the combined aggregate cold feed
 conveyor via a diverter device, from the stopped conveyor belt or from the same location
 
 129
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 as samples for determination of asphalt binder content, at the discretion of the Engineer.
 Two separate samples will be taken, one for acceptance testing and one held in reserve
 for retesting if requested. The aggregate gradation for samples from the conveyer
 system will be determined according to ATM 304. For HMA samples, the gradation will
 be determined according to ATM 408 from the aggregate remaining after the ignition
 oven (ATM 406) has burned off the asphalt binder. Locate diverter devices for obtaining
 aggregate samples from drum mix plants on the conveyor system delivering combined
 aggregates into the drum. Divert aggregate from the full width of the conveyor system
 and maintain the diverter device to provide a representative sample of aggregate
 incorporated into the HMA.
 b. Batch Plants. Samples will be taken from dry batched aggregates according to ATM 301
 or from the same location as samples for determination of asphalt binder content, at the
 discretion of the Engineer. Two separate samples will be taken, one for acceptance
 testing and one held in reserve for retesting if requested. The aggregate gradation for
 dry batch samples will be determined according to ATM 304. For HMA samples, the
 gradation will be determined according to ATM 408 from the aggregate remaining after
 the ignition oven (ATM 406) has burned off the asphalt binder.
 3. Density. The Engineer will determine and mark the location(s) where the Contractor takes
 each core sample.
 a. Mat Cores: The location(s) for taking core samples is determined using a set of random
 numbers (independent of asphalt binder and aggregate sampling set of random numbers)
 and the Engineer's judgment. Take no mat cores within 1 foot of a joint or edge. Core
 samples are not taken on bridge decks.
 b. Longitudinal Joint Cores: The Engineer will mark the location(s) to take the core sample,
 centered on the visible surface joint, and adjacent to the mat core sample taken in the
 panel completing the joint.
 Take core samples according to ATM 413 in the presence of the Engineer. Cut full depth
 core samples, centered on the marks and as noted above, from the finished HMA within
 24 hours after final rolling. Neatly core drill one six inch diameter sample at each marked
 location. Use a core extractor to remove the core - do not damage the core. The
 Engineer will immediately take possession of the samples. Backfill and compact voids
 left by coring with new HMA within 24 hours. The Engineer will determine density of
 samples according to ATM 410.
 4. Retest. When test results have failed to meet specifications, retest of acceptance test results
 for asphalt binder content, gradation, and density may be requested provided the quality
 control requirements of Subsection 401-3.02 are met. Deliver this request in writing to the
 Engineer within 7 days of receipt of the final test of the lot. The Engineer will mark the
 sample location for the density retest within a 2 foot radius of the original core. The original
 test results are discarded and the retest result is used in the price adjustment calculation
 regardless of whether the retest result gives a higher or lower pay factor. Only one retest per
 sample is allowed. When gradation and asphalt binder content are determined from the
 same sample, a request for a retest of either gradation or asphalt binder content results in a
 retest of both. Both gradation and asphalt binder content retest results are used in the price
 adjustment calculation. Retesting will be performed by a department laboratory.
 5. Asphalt Binder Grade. The lot size for asphalt binder is 200 tons. If a project has more than
 one lot and the remaining asphalt binder quantity is less than 150 tons, it is added to the
 previous lot and that total quantity will be evaluated as one lot. If the remaining asphalt
 binder quantity is 150 tons or greater, it is sampled, tested and evaluated as a separate lot.
 
 130
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 If the bid quantity of asphalt binder is between 85 – 200 tons, the contract quantity is
 considered as one lot and sampled, tested, and evaluated according to this subsection.
 Quantities of asphalt binder less than 85 tons will be accepted based on manufacturer’s
 certified test reports and certification of compliance.
 Sample asphalt binder at the plant from the supply line in the presence of the Engineer
 according to ATM 401. The Engineer will take immediate possession of the samples. Take
 three samples from each lot, one for acceptance testing, one for Contractor requested
 retesting, and one held in reserve for referee testing if requested. Meet Subsection 702
 requirements for asphalt binder quality.
 6. Asphalt Binder Grade Retest. Retest of acceptance test results may be requested provided
 the quality control requirements of Subsection 401-3.02 are met. Deliver the request in
 writing to the Engineer within 7 days of receipt of notice of failing test. The original test
 results are discarded and the retest result is used for acceptance. Only one retest per
 sample is allowed.
 If the contractor challenges the result of the retest, the referee sample held by the Engineer
 will be sent to a mutually agreed upon independent AASHTO accredited laboratory for
 testing. The original acceptance test result, the retest acceptance test result, and the referee
 sample test result will be evaluated according to ASTM D3244 to obtain an Assigned Test
 Value (ATV). The ATV value will be used to determine if the asphalt binder conforms to the
 contract. The Contractor shall pay for the referee sample test if the ATV confirms the asphalt
 binder does not meet contract requirements.
 401-4.03 EVALUATION OF MATERIALS FOR ACCEPTANCE.
 The following methods are applied to each type of HMA when Price Adjustment Pay Items are
 included in the Bid Schedule. These methods describe how price adjustments are determined
 based on the quality of the HMA, longitudinal joint density and pavement smoothness.
 The Engineer may reject material which appears to be defective based on visual inspection. If a
 test of rejected material is requested, a minimum of two samples are collected from the rejected
 material and tested. If all test results are within specification limits, payment for the material is
 made.
 1. HMA Price Adjustment. Acceptance test results for HMA asphalt binder content, gradation
 and mat density are used in HMA price adjustment. These test results for a lot are analyzed
 collectively and statistically by the Quality Level Analysis (QLA) method as specified in
 Subsection 106-1.03.3 to determine the total estimated percentage of the lot that is within
 specification limits. The values for percent passing the #200 sieve, asphalt binder content
 and density test results are reported to the nearest 0.1 percent. All other sieves used in QLA
 are reported to the nearest whole number.
 The HMA price adjustment is based on the lower of two pay factors. The first factor is a
 composite pay factor (CPF) for HMA that includes gradation and asphalt binder content. The
 second is the density pay factor (DPF).
 A lot containing material with less than a 1.00 pay factor is accepted at an adjusted price,
 provided that pay factor is at least 0.80 and there are no isolated defects identified by the
 Engineer. A lot containing material that fails to obtain the minimum pay factor is considered
 unacceptable and rejected under Subsection 105-1.11.
 HMA pay factors are computed as follows:
 a. All statistical Quality Level Analysis (QLA) is computed using the Engineer’s Price
 Adjustment programs.

 The Density Pay Factor (DPF) is computed using HMA mat core compaction acceptance
 test results.
 The CPF and DPF are rounded to the nearest 0.001. The price adjustment for each
 individual lot is calculated as follows:
 HMA Price Adjustment = [(CPF or DPF)* -1.00] x (tons in lot) x (PAB)
 * CPF or DPF, whichever is lower
 PAB = Price Adjustment Base =
 [Bid Unit Price for 401(1_) + (n/100) x Bid Unit Price for 401(4_)],
 Where
 n = Optimum asphalt binder content percent, established by the JMD.
 The HMA Price Adjustment is the sum of the price adjustments for each lot and paid for
 under Item 401(8_).
 2. Longitudinal Joint Density Price Adjustment. A longitudinal joint density price adjustment will
 be based on the project average of all top lift joint densities and determined as follows:
 a. If project average top lift joint density is less than 91.0 percent MSG, apply the following
 disincentive:
 Longitudinal joint density price adjustment equal to $3.00 per lineal foot is deducted.
 b. If project average top lift joint density is greater than 92.0 percent MSG, apply the
 following incentive:
 Longitudinal joint density price adjustment equal to $1.50 per linear foot is added.
 The Longitudinal Joint Density Price Adjustment is the total price adjustment paid for under
 Item 401(9).
 3. Pavement Smoothness Price Adjustment. Pavement smoothness will be measured by the
 Engineer and reported as IRI (inches/mile), according to Subsection 401-3.18. Incentive for
 pavement smoothness shall apply only if both the project average CPF and DPF are greater
 than or equal to 1.000. Disincentive for pavement smoothness shall apply regardless of the
 project average CPF or DPF.
 The Engineer will calculate the pavement smoothness price adjustment according to Method
 1 or Method 2 below, as identified in the bid schedule.
 Method 1: SPA = PAB x PQ x SF,
 Where:
 SPA = Pavement Smoothness Price Adjustment
 PAB = Price Adjustment Base
 PAB = [Bid Unit Price for 401(1_) + (n/100) x Bid Unit Price for 401(4_)],
 n = optimum asphalt binder content, percent, established by the JMD
 PQ = Top layer HMA quantity, tons
 SF = Smoothness Factor (Table 401-4)

 401-4.04 ASPHALT MATERIAL PRICE ADJUSTMENT.
 Asphalt Material Price Adjustment. This subsection provides a price adjustment for asphalt
 material by: (1) additional compensation to the contractor or (2) a deduction from the contract
 amount.
 1. This provision shall apply:
 a. To asphalt material meeting the criteria of Section 702, and is included in items listed in
 the bid schedule of Sections 306, 307, 308, 401 thru 408, 520, 608 and 609.
 b. To cost changes in asphalt material that occur between the date of bid opening and the
 date on the certified bill of lading from the asphalt material refiner/producer.
 c.
 
 When there is more than a 7.5 percent increase or decrease in the Alaska Asphalt
 Material Price Index, AAMPI, from the date of bid opening to the date on the certified bill
 of lading from the asphalt refiner/producer.
 
 2. Provide the certified bill of lading from the asphalt material refiner/producer.
 3. The AAMPI is calculated bimonthly on the first and third Friday of each month, and will
 remain in effect from the day of calculation until the next bimonthly calculation. The AAMPI is
 posted on the Department’s Statewide Materials website at and calculated according to the
 formula posted there. http://www.dot.state.ak.us/stwddes/desmaterials/aprice_index.shtml

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 401
 
 4. Price adjustment will be cumulative and calculated with each progress payment. Use the
 AAMPI in effect on the date of the certified bill of lading from the asphalt material
 refiner/producer, to calculate the price adjustment for asphalt material The Department will
 increase or decrease payment under this contract by the amount determined with the
 following asphalt material price adjustment formula:
 For an increase exceeding 7.5 percent, additional compensation = [(IPP – IB) – (0.075 x
 IB)] x Q
 For a decrease exceeding 7.5 percent, deduction from contract = [(IB – IPP) – (0.075 x
 IB)] x Q
 Where:
 Q = Quantity of Asphalt Material incorporated into project during the pay period, in
 tons as measured by the Engineer
 IB = Index at Bid: the Bi-monthly AAMPI in effect on date of bid, in dollars per ton
 IPP = Index at Pay Period: The bi-monthly AAMPI in effect on the date shown on
 the certified bill of lading from the asphalt refiner/producer, in dollars per ton
 5. Method of measurement for determining Q (quantity) is the weight of asphalt material that
 meets the criteria of this subsection and is incorporated into the project. The quantity does
 not include aggregate, mineral filler, blotter material, thinning agents added after material
 qualification, or water for emulsified asphalt. The quantity for emulsified asphalts will be
 based on the asphalt residue material only and will be calculated using the percent residue
 from testing, or if not tested, from the manufacturer’s certificate of compliance.

 materials or concrete proportions were more closely restricted than those in the
 proposed work.
 For a single group of at least 10 consecutive compressive strength tests for one
 mixture, verify the average of the compressive strength tests equals or exceeds the
 Required Average Compressive Strength.
 For two groups, each having at least 10 consecutive compressive strength tests, for
 two mixtures representing classes of concrete within 1000 psi of the Specified
 Compressive Strength, plot the average strength of each group versus the watercementitious material ratio of the corresponding mixture proportions and interpolate

 strength equals or exceeds the Required Average Compressive Strength.
 (2) Laboratory Trial Mixtures. Use materials and material combinations for trial mixtures
 of the same brand and type and from the same manufacturer as the materials used in
 the work.
 Record the temperature of the freshly mixed concrete according to ASTM C1064 and
 ensure the temperature is within 10°F of the intended maximum temperature of the
 concrete as mixed and delivered.
 For each trial mixture, make and cure at least two 6.0 x 12.0 inch or at least three 4.0
 x 8.0 inch compressive strength test cylinders for each test age according to
 AASHTO R 39. Test for compressive strength according to AASHTO T 22 at test
 ages of 3, 7 and 28 days.

 For a group of trial mixtures, make at least three trial mixtures with each mixture
 having a different cementitious material content. Select water-cement ratios
 producing a range of compressive strengths encompassing the Required Average
 Compressive Strength. From the results of the 28-day compressive strength tests,
 plot a curve showing the relationship between water-cement ratio and compressive
 strength. From the curve of water-cement ratio versus compressive strength,
 determine the compressive strength corresponding to the water-cementitious material
 ratio of the Job Mix Design. Verify the compressive strength equals or exceeds the

 2. Measuring Materials.
 a. Cementitious Materials. Use cementitious materials of the same brand, type, and from
 the same plant of manufacture as the cementitious materials used to verify the approved
 Job Mix Design according to Subsection 501-2.02.7. Ensure the quantity of the Portland
 cement and the cumulative quantity of Portland cement plus other cementitious materials
 is proportioned in amounts required by the Job Mix Design and meets the mix
 acceptance requirements.
 Measure cementitious materials by weight. When other cementitious materials, including
 fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, or silica fume, are specified in the concrete
 proportions, the material may be cumulatively weighed with the Portland cement. Weigh
 cementitious materials on a weighing device that is separate and distinct from those used
 for other materials. Weigh the Portland cement before other cementitious materials.
 Portland cement is permitted to be measured in bags of standard weight (94 pounds). Do
 not use a fraction of a bag of cementitious materials unless its weight has been
 determined by calibrated weighting devices.
 b. Aggregates. Use aggregates from the same sources and gradations as the aggregates
 used in the trial mixtures or field test records used to verify the required average
 compressive strength. Ensure the quantity of the aggregates is proportioned in amounts
 required by the Job Mix Design.
 Measure aggregates by weight. Establish batch weight measurements on dry materials
 and adjust the actual scaled weight for the required dry materials weight plus the total
 weight of moisture, both absorbed and surface, contained in the aggregate.
 c.
 
 Water. The total quantity of mixing water includes water added to the batch, ice added to
 the batch, and water occurring as surface moisture on the aggregates. Measure the
 added water by weight or volume. Measure added ice by weight. Discharge the flush
 water (wash water) prior to loading the next batch of concrete. Do not use flush water
 (wash water) as a portion of the mixing water.
 
 d. Admixtures. Use concrete admixtures according to the manufacturer's instructions and as
 approved in the Job Mix Design. Measure powdered admixtures by weight. Measure
 paste or liquid admixtures by weight or volume.
 3. Materials Storage and Handling.
 a. Cementitious Materials. Keep cementitious materials dry and free from contaminants. Do
 not use cementitious materials which have become partially hydrated or which contain
 lumps of caked cementitious material.
 b. Aggregates. Do not allow segregation of the aggregates or contamination with foreign
 materials. Separate aggregate to prevent intermixing of specified gradations.
 Drain aggregate so the moisture content is uniform and is accounted for during the
 batching process.
 Do not use aggregates that contain ice, are frozen, or have been heated directly by
 combustible materials. Use direct steam, steam-coil, or water-coil heating when heating
 
 156
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 aggregates. When direct steam is used to thaw aggregate piles, drain aggregates to
 uniform moisture content before batching.
 c.
 
 Admixtures. Protect admixtures from contamination, evaporation, or damage. Store
 admixtures according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protect liquid admixtures from
 freezing and from temperature changes affecting the admixture’s performance.

 a. The volume of concrete in the mixer after the additional water is added does not exceed
 the maximum mixing capacity.
 b. The water measuring device is calibrated according to Subsection 501-3.01.1.e.
 c.
 
 The total quantity of mixing water, including water added according to Subsection 5013.02.1 is within the proportion requirements in Subsection 501-3.03.4. Account for the
 actual volume of concrete remaining in the mixer.
 
 d. Water additions are completed within 30 minutes after the introduction of the mixing
 water to the cementitious materials.
 The addition of water is not prohibited from being several distinct additions of water. Inject
 additional water into the mixer under pressure and direction of flow to allow for proper
 distribution within the mixer. Provide additional mixing to ensure a thoroughly combined and
 uniform mixture is attained.
 2. Time for Placement. Discharge the concrete within 1.5 hours of the following:
 a. after adding the mixing water to the cementitious materials, and
 b. after adding the cementitious materials to the aggregates.
 The time to complete discharging the concrete may be extended 2 minutes for every degree
 the concrete temperature is below 70°F, measured at the point of discharge, to a maximum
 total time of 2 hours. The Engineer may extend the Time for Placement if Time of Initial Set
 information is provided in the approved Job Mix Design submittal.
 501-3.03 EVALUATION OF MATERIAL FOR ACCEPTANCE. All concrete in the work will be
 evaluated for acceptance.
 The Engineer may reject a batch or load of concrete failing to meet the requirements for
 proportions, slump, total air content, or temperature. Prior to sampling, the Engineer may reject a
 batch or load of concrete that appears defective in composition.

 7. Temperature Requirements. Unless otherwise noted, ensure the concrete temperature is
 between 50°F and 90°F when placed in the forms.
 8. Compressive Strength Requirements. Meet the strength requirements for the Specified
 Compressive Strength. Concrete of the approved Job Mix Design will be considered to meet
 
 159
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 the Specified Compressive Strength requirements when both of the following conditions are
 met:
 a. The lowest individual compressive strength test result is not less than the Specified
 Compressive Strength minus 500 psi, or 90.0 percent of the Specified Compressive
 Strength, whichever is lower.
 b. The lowest averaged result of three consecutive compressive strength tests meets or
 exceeds the Specified Compressive Strength.
 501-3.04 PREPARATION FOR CONCRETE PLACEMENT. Allow time for inspection prior to
 concrete placement.
 Remove debris, concrete splatter, oil, paint, and other foreign substances from the surfaces of
 forms and reinforcing steel, against which the concrete is to be placed.
 Remove soil and other debris from pipe piles to the bottom of concrete elevation shown on the
 Plan.
 Prepare foundations according to Section 205.
 Moisten foundations and forms with water before the concrete is placed. Remove standing water
 on the foundation, in the pile, and in the forms before placing concrete.
 501-3.05 PLACING CONCRETE. Do not begin concrete placement without the Engineer's
 authorization. Place concrete conforming to the approved Job Mix Design. Place and consolidate
 each layer within 30 minutes and before the preceding layer takes initial set.
 If concrete placement operations are delayed so initial set occurs before placement of the
 succeeding section or layer, place a joint according to Subsection 501-3.11. The resulting joint
 will be considered a construction joint. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the location of the
 construction joint will affect the strength or durability of the concrete, the Engineer may reject the
 concrete, the structure, or a portion of the structure.
 Place concrete in a sequence to obtain a well-consolidated concrete and to prevent cracks. Place
 concrete as near as possible to final position. Prevent segregation of the mix, displacement of
 reinforcing steel, and spattering of mortar on the reinforcing steel and forms above the elevation
 of the layer being placed. Do not deposit a large quantity of concrete at any point and run or work
 the concrete along the forms. Do not allow concrete to slide down the sides of the forms.
 Regulate concrete placement so the pressures do not exceed the load capacity of the forms.
 Limit layer thickness to no more than 2.5 feet, or the capacity of the vibrators to consolidate and
 merge the concrete with the previous layer, whichever is less.
 Unless otherwise specified, use a tremie, tube, or other such device to limit the free-fall height to
 less than 5.0 feet when placing operations would otherwise allow concrete to drop more than 5.0
 feet. When using a tremie to place concrete, use a watertight tremie with an inside diameter of at
 least 10 inches. When using a concrete pump to place concrete, use concrete pump lines that
 are watertight with an inside diameter of at least 5 inches.
 Concrete placed in piles or in dry-shaft process may free-fall more than 5 feet without use of
 tremie, tube or other such device, provided the falling concrete does not contact rebar or other
 objects before reaching the top surface of the placed concrete. When free-falling concrete more
 than 5 feet, use a drop chute at least 3 feet long.
 After initial set, prevent movement of forms, projecting ends of reinforcing steel, and other
 embedded items.
 
 160
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 Do not use aluminum components in contact with fresh concrete.
 Place concrete in the superstructure only after substructure forms are removed and the
 substructure has been inspected.
 1. Concrete Placement Plan. Submit a concrete placement plan to the Engineer, for concrete
 decks and drilled shafts. Submit each concrete placement plan to the Engineer, at least 30
 days before placing concrete. Do not place concrete until after the Engineer has approved
 the plan. Include the following in each concrete placement plan:
 a. concrete placement sequence,
 b. schedule of concrete placement and curing,
 c.
 
 estimated concrete volume of each section,
 
 d. placement rate and duration,
 e. description of finishing equipment,
 f.
 
 placement procedure,
 
 g. name of the concrete foreman,
 h. curing materials, equipment, and procedure.
 2. Pre-concreting Conference. Hold a pre-concreting conference for concrete decks and Drilled
 Shafts, at least 5 working days before placing concrete. Include the Engineer, the
 Superintendent and foremen in charge of placing reinforcing steel, placing concrete, finishing
 concrete, and curing operations. Discuss construction procedures, personnel, and equipment
 to be used.
 If the project includes more than one concrete placement operation, and if key personnel
 change between concreting operations, hold additional conferences to include replacement
 personnel before placing successive concrete sections.
 3. Pumping Concrete. Use a pump producing a continuous stream of concrete without air
 pockets. When pumping is completed, the concrete remaining in the pipeline, if used, must
 eject without contaminating the concrete or separating the ingredients. Discard concrete
 contaminated by priming or cleaning the pump.
 4. Conveying Concrete. Concrete may be conveyed if the equipment will handle the class of
 concrete, with the slump and air content specified and without segregation of the aggregate,
 and no equipment vibrations will damage freshly placed concrete or reinforcing steel. Limit
 the length of conveyor belts to prevent aggregate segregation or 300 feet, whichever is less.
 Cover the belt to protect the concrete from heat, evaporation, precipitation, or when the
 Engineer determines precipitation is likely.
 5. Piles. Do not place concrete underwater in piles.
 6. Drilled Shaft Foundations. Place concrete following either the wet-shaft process or dry-shaft
 process, as applicable.
 The dry-shaft process may be used where the ground water level and soil and rock
 conditions are suitable to permit construction of the shaft in a relatively dry excavation, and
 where the sides and bottom of the shaft can be visually inspected by the Engineer prior to
 placing the concrete. Relatively dry excavation conditions exist when excavation fluids have
 
 161
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 been removed from the shaft and the rate of water intrusion is less than 6 inches of water
 accumulating above the base in a 1-hour period without pumping or other methods to drain or
 remove water. Suitable soil and rock conditions exist when the sides and bottom of the hole
 remain stable without caving, sloughing, or swelling between completion of excavation and
 concrete placement; and loose material and water can be satisfactorily removed prior to
 inspection and concrete placement. Do not begin concrete placement if there is more than 1
 inch of water in the bottom of the shaft excavation. Use wet-shaft process if the requirements
 for dry-shaft process cannot be satisfied.
 Provide process control testing during concrete placement. Test slump and air content before
 placing each batch of concrete in the drilled shaft. Perform sampling and testing according to
 Subsection 501-3.03.2 using a WAQTC qualified concrete testing technician or ACI certified
 concrete field testing technician. Test every batch of concrete before placement. Record the
 time when each sample is collected. Submit test results in writing to the Engineer
 immediately after completing each test.
 a. Wet-Shaft Process. Place concrete using a tremie or concrete pump. Place concrete
 continuously until good quality concrete, as determined by the Engineer, is evident at top
 of the shaft or nearest construction joint. Good quality concrete is considered concrete of
 the same consistency, appearance, and quality as the concrete being delivered and
 meeting the applicable mix acceptance requirements. Remove a sufficient volume of
 concrete to ensure elimination of contaminated concrete at the top of shaft before
 continuing with subsequent construction operations.
 Remove concrete laitance during or immediately after concrete placement operations
 have ended.
 Do not allow water, fluids, drilling aids, or concrete from the top of the shaft to enter
 streams or other waterways.
 Construct the discharge end of the tremie or pump line to prevent water intrusion and
 permit the free flow of concrete during concrete placement. Use caps, bottom plates,
 pigs, or other such devices inserted into or attached to discharge pipe to separate the
 concrete from the excavation fluid during initial charging of the discharge pipe. Ensure
 the discharge pipe has sufficient length and weight to rest on the shaft base before
 starting concrete placement.
 When using a tremie, provide adequate support so the tremie can be raised to increase
 the discharge of concrete and lowered to reduce the discharge of concrete. Do not
 shake, vibrate, or rapidly raise or lower the tremie to increase the discharge of the
 concrete.
 Maintain a positive head of concrete inside the tremie or pump line relative to the
 excavation fluid level. Position the discharge orifice within one pipe diameter of the shaft
 base. Do not re-position the discharge pipe until the orifice is at least 8 feet below the
 concrete surface. Maintain at least 8 feet of concrete above the discharge orifice during
 concrete placement. Monitor the concrete level during placement to ensure the tremie or
 pump line discharge orifice remains at least 8 feet below the concrete surface throughout
 placement.
 If the discharge orifice rises above the concrete surface before concrete placement is
 complete, the shaft will be considered defective. Immediately terminate concrete
 placement operations and notify the Engineer.
 (1) Concrete Flowability Requirements. Ensure concrete placed in the shaft remains
 flowable throughout placement operations by maintaining a slump of at least 6 inches
 
 162
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 until placement is completed. Collect samples from the first batch of concrete. Test
 slump from the first batch of concrete at the beginning of the concrete placement
 operations and immediately after concrete placement operations are complete.
 Record the time when samples are collected and when tests are performed. Submit
 test results in writing to the Engineer immediately after completing each test.
 b. Dry-Shaft Process. Place concrete continuously until concrete is evident at top of the
 shaft or nearest construction joint. Concrete may be permitted to free-fall into place if the
 concrete does not contact the sides of the shaft, reinforcing steel, or other objects while
 free falling.
 Remove concrete laitance during or immediately after concrete placement operations
 have ended.
 (1) Concrete Plasticity Requirements. Ensure concrete placed in the shaft remains
 plastic throughout placement operations by completing placement operations before
 initial set occurs.
 7. Concrete Decks and Approach Slabs. Before placing concrete, operate the finishing machine
 over the entire length of the deck to check screed deflection, reinforcing steel clearance, and
 concrete thickness.
 Limit the rate of placing concrete to what can be finished before initial set.
 a. Placement Sequence. Place the concrete deck in the sequence shown on the Plans. The
 Engineer may approve a revised placement sequence for casting the concrete deck
 continuously from one end to the other provided the following:
 (1) Stockpile the materials necessary to complete the placement and have the
 equipment, incidentals, and workers on the site before beginning concrete placement
 operations.
 (2) Ensure the continuous concrete placement and finishing operation proceeds at a
 minimum rate of 30 feet per hour, measured longitudinally along the axis of the span.
 (3) The Engineer determines the revised placement sequence will not reduce the
 stability during construction and will not reduce the quality, capacity, or durability of
 the completed structure.
 If the Engineer approves the proposal for a continuous concrete placement operation, the
 Department will observe and evaluate performance to the first planned construction joint
 in the sequence. At this point, the Engineer may authorize you to proceed with the
 continuous concrete placement operation or suspend the placement and install a
 construction joint. The Engineer's decision will be based on whether the concrete can be
 produced, delivered, and finished at a continuous rate permitting the structure to
 accommodate final dead load deflections while the concrete is plastic.
 If the Engineer suspends the continuous concrete placement operations after the first
 sequential placement, submit modifications for improving the continuous concrete
 placement operations, beginning at the other end of the deck. If a second attempt at
 continuous concrete placement is authorized, the placement will be evaluated and
 allowed or terminated based on the same criteria as the first sequential placement.
 If the Engineer suspends the continuous concrete placement operation after the second
 attempt, additional attempts will not be permitted. Follow the deck placing sequence
 shown on the Plans.

 SECTION 501
 
 501-3.06 CONSOLIDATION OF CONCRETE. Consolidate concrete to make a dense
 homogeneous mass free of voids and rock pockets. Consolidate each layer to leave a compact,
 dense, and impervious concrete with smooth faces on exposed surfaces with no visible line of
 separation between adjoining layers.
 Consolidate concrete, except underwater or other exempted placements, by mechanical vibration
 at the point of deposit. Use vibrators capable of visibly affecting concrete with a 1-inch slump for a
 distance of at least 18 inches from the vibrator.
 Use vibrators and regulate placement in order to consolidate the fresh concrete within 15 minutes
 of placement and before initial set. Effectively vibrate the full depth of each layer.
 For immersion-type vibrators, insert vibrators vertically to a depth penetrating into the previous
 layer. Withdraw vibrators slowly to avoid segregation or grout pockets. Vibrate in a uniform
 pattern spaced less than 1.5 times the radius of visible effectiveness.
 Avoid vibration of initially set layers and reinforcing steel below the succeeding placement. Do not
 hold vibrators against reinforcing steel or use them to flow or spread the concrete into place.
 Manipulate vibrators to produce concrete free of voids, with proper texture on exposed faces, and
 maximum consolidation. Do not allow the concrete to segregate, form pools of mortar, or form
 laitance on the surface.
 When immersion-type vibrators are used to consolidate concrete around epoxy-coated reinforcing
 steel, use rubber or nonmetallic vibrator heads that will not damage epoxy coatings.
 Concrete may be placed directly into drilled shaft foundations and piles without mechanical
 vibration; except, vibrate the top 5 feet of concrete. For drilled shaft foundations, consolidate the
 top 5 feet of concrete after good quality concrete is evident at the top of the shaft and after water,
 slurry, drilling aids, and other materials other than concrete have been removed.
 501-3.07 FINISHING CONCRETE SURFACES. After the concrete is consolidated and prior to
 the application of curing materials, strike off unformed concrete surfaces to the required elevation
 and slope. Finish the surface by floating the surface to remove local irregularities and leave
 sufficient mortar to seal the concrete surface. Do not use mortar topping for concrete surfaces.
 Do not use aluminum finishing equipment.
 Complete initial floating operations before bleed water or excess moisture is present on the
 surface and before the concrete takes initial set. Complete final finishing before final set occurs.
 Do not use finishing aids or additional water to assist in finishing concrete surfaces. Do not finish
 concrete surfaces if bleed water, excess moisture, or curing materials are present.
 Provide formed concrete surfaces with an ordinary finish unless otherwise noted.
 1. Ordinary Finish. An ordinary finish is the finish left on a surface after removing the forms,
 filling the holes left by the form ties, and repairing defects. Ensure the surface is true and
 even and free from rock pockets and depressions or projections.
 Immediately after removing the forms, remove the metal devices holding the forms in place
 and passing through the body of the concrete, or cut them back at least 1 inch beneath the
 surface of the concrete. Remove fins of mortar and irregularities caused by form joints.
 Patch cavities produced by form ties, depressions, holes, and voids greater than 1/4 inch. Fill
 the cavity with stiff mortar composed of one part of Portland cement to two parts of fine
 aggregate. Proportion the mortar by loose volume with only enough water to form a small ball
 when squeezed gently by hand. Clean the cavity and saturate the concrete with water before
 filling the cavity. Thoroughly tamp the mixture into place. Float the surface of the mortar
 
 164
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 before initial set to make the surface neat in appearance. Cure the patch according to
 Subsection 501-3.08.
 Do not repair concrete with rock pockets, cracks, or other defects until the concrete is
 inspected by the Engineer. Concrete repaired prior to inspection by the Engineer may be
 rejected. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the defect will affect the strength or durability of the
 concrete, the Engineer may reject the concrete, the structure, or portion of the structure. If the
 defect is greater than 3/4 inch in depth, submit a repair plan including complete details of the
 method, materials, and equipment proposed for use in repairing the concrete. Obtain the
 Engineer's approval of the repair plan before repairing the defect. A repair plan is not required
 if the defect is less than 3/4 inch in depth.
 Repair broken corners and edges, rock pockets, and other defects. If the defect is greater
 than 3/4 inch in depth, repair the defect according to the approved repair plan. If the defect is
 less than 3/4 inch in depth, chip away coarse or broken material according to Subsection
 501-3.16 to obtain a dense, uniform surface of concrete exposing solid coarse aggregate. Cut
 feathered edges to form faces perpendicular to the surface. Apply an epoxy bonding agent to
 the concrete mating surfaces according the manufacturer's instructions. Patch the repaired
 area with stiff mortar composed of one part of Portland cement to two parts of fine aggregate.
 Proportion the mortar by loose volume with only enough water to form a small ball when
 squeezed gently by hand.
 Perform repairs prior to releasing falsework, prestressing, or applying additional loads to the
 concrete.
 2. Rubbed Finish. Provide a rubbed finish at locations shown on the Plans. When forms can be
 removed, wet the surface and then rub with a wooden float until irregularities and form marks
 are removed and the surface is covered with a lather composed of cement and water. A thin
 grout composed of one part Portland cement and one part fine aggregate may be used. Allow
 this lather to set for at least 5 days. Then, smooth the surface by lightly rubbing with a fine
 carborundum stone.
 If the concrete has hardened before being rubbed, use a medium coarse carborundum stone
 to finish the surface at least 4 days after placing the concrete. Spread a thin grout composed
 of one part Portland cement and one part fine aggregate over a small area of the surface.
 Immediately rub the surface with the stone until form marks and irregularities are removed
 and the surface is covered with a lather. Allow this lather to set for at least 5 days. Then,
 smooth the surface by rubbing lightly with a fine carborundum stone.
 Complete ordinary finish work before applying the rubbed finish.
 3. Concrete Decks and Approach Slabs. Obtain a smooth riding surface of uniform texture, true
 to the required grade and cross section.
 Use a self-propelled mechanical finishing machine
 a. capable of forward and reverse movement,
 b. with a rotating cylindrical single or double drum screed,
 c.
 
 with necessary adjustments to produce the required cross-section, line, and grade,
 
 d. allowing screeds to be raised and lowered, and
 e. with an upper vertical limit of screed travel permitting the screed to clear the finished
 concrete surface.
 
 165
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 When placing concrete abutting previously placed concrete, equip the finishing machine to
 travel on the existing concrete.
 The Engineer may approve hand-operated motorized roller screeds (friction screeds) where
 jobsite conditions prohibit the use of conventional configuration finishing machines described
 above, for small areas less than 12 feet wide, and on approach slabs in which conventional
 configuration finishing machines are not used to finish the concrete deck. Do not use
 vibratory screeds.
 Use equipment capable of striking off the full placement width without intermediate supports
 or rails. Use rails resting on adjustable supports that can be removed with the least
 disturbance to the concrete. Place the supports on structural members or on forms rigid
 enough to resist deflection. Use supports that are removable to at least 2 inches below the
 finished surface. If possible, place rails outside the finishing area. If not possible, place them
 above the finished surface.
 Use rails (with their supports) that are strong and stiff enough for operation of the equipment
 without excessive deflection. Place and secure rails for the full length of the deck before
 placing concrete. Set the rails to the proper grade and elevations to ensure the required
 profile is provided.
 After placing and consolidating the concrete, carefully strike off the concrete surface. Correct
 imperfections left on the deck. Provide a float finish to surfaces receiving a waterproof
 membrane. Texture other surfaces with a heavy-broom finish perpendicular to the direction of
 traffic.
 Do not place finishing machines or other loads on the screed rail supports or on features
 supporting fresh concrete after the concrete has initially set and before the concrete attains at
 least 80 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength.
 Do not release falsework or wedges supporting concrete on either side of a joint until each
 side has cured as specified.
 4. Curb, Sidewalk, and Concrete Barrier Surfaces. Finish exposed faces of curbs, sidewalks,
 and concrete barriers to true surfaces and provide a broom finish. Broom finish sidewalks
 perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
 5. Sandblasted Finish. Sandblast the cured concrete surface with hard, sharp abrasive media to
 produce an even fine-grained surface in which the mortar has been cut away, leaving the
 aggregate exposed.
 6. Trowel Finish. Trowel the surface smooth and free of trowel marks.
 501-3.08 CURING CONCRETE. Maintain a satisfactory moisture content and temperature in the
 concrete immediately after finishing operations are completed.
 1. Initial Curing Period. Before final curing, ensure the surface of the concrete is kept moist.
 Concrete surface is beginning to dry when no bleed water is present and the surface color
 changes. If the concrete surface begins to dry before the final curing method can be applied,
 prevent further loss of moisture by one or more of the following methods:
 a. Fog Spray. Use equipment producing a fog spray from an atomizing nozzle with sufficient
 velocity to cover the entire concrete surface. Direct the atomized water spray above the
 concrete surface to allow the fog to drift down to the concrete surface. Do not apply the
 discharge of the atomized water spray directly at the concrete surface. Continue fogging
 to maintain the reflective appearance of the damp concrete. Do not allow the surface to
 dry, or to undergo cycles of drying and wetting. Keep the concrete surface damp, but do
 
 166
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 not accumulate water until after final set has occurred. Use water meeting the
 requirements of Subsection 712-2.01.
 b. Evaporation Rate Reducer. Apply a monomolecular film intended specifically as an
 evaporation rate reducer to entrap bleed water or excess moisture on the concrete
 surface. Apply the evaporation rate reducer according to the manufacturer’s written
 instructions. Do not use the evaporation rate reducer during finishing operations or as a
 finishing aid. Do not use evaporation rate reducers on concrete surfaces receiving a
 waterproofing membrane such as concrete decks, approach slabs, end diaphragms and
 decked precast concrete members.
 2. Final Curing Period. Unless otherwise noted, employ the final curing method immediately
 following finishing operations.
 Use wet curing on construction joints, concrete with a mix design water-cement ratio less
 than 0.40, concrete decks, approach slabs, and other concrete surfaces subject to tire
 contact in the completed structure. For other concrete, use wet curing, liquid membraneforming curing, forms-in-place curing, or a combination of these curing methods.
 Do not use liquid membrane-forming curing compounds on concrete surfaces to which other
 materials will be cast against or bonded such as concrete and waterproofing membranes.
 In addition to the requirements in this section, precast concrete members may use
 accelerated curing.
 a. Wet Curing. Until the end of the curing period, provide continuous moisture by:
 (1) watering a covering of heavy burlap blankets or quilted cotton mats,
 (2) keeping concrete surfaces wet with water continuously,
 (3) wetting the outside surfaces of wood forms.
 Wait to install curing materials until the concrete has sufficiently hardened to permit such
 operations without damaging the concrete or marring the finish. While waiting to employ
 curing materials, maintain the concrete surface moisture as specified for the initial curing
 period.
 Uniformly distribute absorbent materials across the entire concrete surface. Apply water
 in a manner that will not displace the curing materials or erode the concrete surface.
 Keep the concrete surfaces continuously wet. Do not allow concrete surfaces to dry or
 alternate with wetting and drying cycles. Cover the concrete, wooden forms and
 absorbent material with impermeable sheeting. Use white reflective impermeable
 sheeting if direct sunlight is present, or if the Engineer determines direct sunlight may be
 present during the curing period.
 Do not use absorbent materials containing harmful substances such as sugar or fertilizer,
 or materials that may discolor the concrete.
 b. Liquid Membrane-Forming Curing Compounds. Apply liquid membrane-forming
 compounds immediately after final finishing and as soon as the free water has
 disappeared, no water sheen is visible, and bleeding has essentially ceased. Apply two
 coats of liquid membrane-forming compound with the second coat at right angles to the
 first. Apply both coats of liquid membrane-forming compounds uniformly until the original
 color of the concrete is obscured. Apply liquid membrane-forming compound according to
 the manufacturer’s instructions.
 
 167
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 Do not apply the liquid membrane-forming compound to dry concrete surfaces. Moisten
 the concrete surface, without standing water, before applying the liquid membraneforming compound. Protect the membrane from damage for the duration of the curing
 period. Re-apply the liquid membrane-forming compound if the membrane is cracked or
 damaged during the curing period.
 c.
 
 Forms-In-Place Curing. Formed concrete surfaces may be cured by retaining the forms in
 place for the entire curing period. Keep the forms moisture tight. Do not loosen forms. For
 wooden forms, keep the forms wet as required for wet curing. If gaps develop between
 the forms or between the forms and concrete:
 (1) remove the forms and implement another curing method
 (2) keep the gaps continuously filled with water for the remainder of the curing period.
 
 d. Accelerated Curing. Accelerated curing may be used only for precast concrete members
 with Class P Concrete.
 During the curing period, keep the concrete in a saturated curing atmosphere until the
 concrete achieves the required release strength.
 The curing period may be accelerated by using saturated low-pressure steam,
 convection-heat, or radiant-heat in a suitable curing chamber to contain the live steam or
 heat. Provide at least 3 inches of clearance between the enclosure and forms to allow
 adequate circulation.
 If accelerated curing methods are used, embed at least one temperature-recording
 device in the concrete to verify concrete temperatures are within the specified limits.
 Install one temperature-recording device, accurate to ±5°F, near the member’s midpoint,
 6 to 8 inches from the top or bottom, and along the member’s centerline. Monitor the
 concrete temperature with the temperature-recording device sensor arranged and
 calibrated to continuously record, date, and identify the concrete temperature throughout
 the heating cycle. Begin recording temperatures once concrete is placed in the forms.
 Stop recording temperatures after the heating cycle is complete and when the concrete
 temperature is within 20°F of the air temperature to which the concrete will be exposed.
 Upon request, submit the temperature record to the Engineer for each precast concrete
 member.
 While waiting to begin the heating cycle, maintain the concrete temperature between
 50°F and 90°F and maintain concrete surface moisture as specified for the initial curing
 period. Do not apply steam, convection-heat or radiant-heat prior to initial set except to
 maintain the concrete temperature. Determine the time of initial set according to
 AASHTO T 197.
 Begin the heating cycle immediately after the initial set. Prevent hot air and steam from
 blowing directly onto the concrete or forms. Increase the concrete temperature at an
 average rate not exceeding 40°F per hour until the curing temperature is reached. Limit
 curing temperature within the concrete to 175°F maximum. Decrease the concrete
 temperature not more than 40°F per hour until reaching a temperature 20°F above the
 temperature of the air to which the concrete will be exposed.
 Apply radiant heat by pipes circulating steam, hot oil, or hot water, or by electric heating
 elements.
 3. Curing Temperature. Maintain concrete temperature at or above 50°F for the first 6 days after
 placement. After 6 days you may choose to maintain concrete temperature between 32°F
 and 50°F with the addition of curing time as specified under 501-3.08.4a.
 
 168
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 4. Ending Curing Operations. Continue curing operations uninterrupted until the required
 concrete properties, strength, and durability have developed or until there is reasonable
 assurance these properties will be achieved after the curing operations have been
 terminated.
 Curing operations may be terminated after both 501-3.08.4.a and 501-3.08.4.b are satisfied:
 a. The concrete has cured for:
 (1) at least 7 days.
 (2) at least 10 days when fly ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag in excess of 10
 percent by weight of the Portland cement are used in the mix.
 Add one additional day of curing to the requirements of 501-3.08.4.a.(1) and 5013.08.4.a.(2), for each day or portion of a day the concrete temperature falls below 50°F
 during the curing period.
 b. The compressive strength from informational field tests reaches the following:
 (1) 70 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength if post curing concrete temperature
 is expected to remain at or above 50°F until 100 percent of the Specified
 Compressive Strength is attained.
 (2) 100 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength, if post curing conditions are
 expected to allow the concrete temperature to fall below 50°F before 100 percent of
 the Specified Compressive Strength is attained.
 501-3.09 PROTECTION OF CONCRETE. Protect concrete from damage. Do not apply loads to
 the concrete until the end of the curing period and until the Engineer determines the concrete has
 attained sufficient strength to safely carry the applied loads without damage. Unless otherwise
 noted, sufficient strength is attained when the concrete has attained a compressive strength,
 determined from informational field tests, of at least 80 percent of the Specified Compressive
 Strength.
 Release forms and falsework according to Section 512.
 During the curing period, protect concrete from damaging mechanical disturbances. Protect
 concrete surfaces from damage by construction traffic, equipment, materials, rain or running
 water, and Cold Weather Conditions, and other adverse weather conditions. Meet the vibration
 limits during pile driving of Section 505.
 Do not backfill against concrete structures until the end of the curing period and until the concrete
 has attained a compressive strength, determined from informational field tests, of at least 80
 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength.
 Obtain authorization from the Engineer before driving vehicles or equipment, or storing materials
 on the structure. Keep the structure closed to traffic until the end of the curing period and until the
 concrete has attained a compressive strength determined from informational field tests, of at least
 100 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength. Obtain authorization from the Engineer
 before opening the structure to traffic.
 1. Rain Protection. Provide materials and equipment on site to protect concrete until final set.

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 2. Cold Temperature Protection. Place and cure concrete according to an approved cold
 temperature concreting plan whenever the air temperature in the shade, away from artificial
 heat, is expected to be below 40° F during placement or curing, or in the opinion of the
 Engineer, the air temperature in the shade, away from artificial heat, is likely to be below 40°F
 during placement or curing.
 Prevent damage to concrete throughout the curing period. Prevent concrete from freezing,
 rapid cooling of concrete surfaces, or from large temperature differences within the concrete.
 Have materials and equipment ready to protect concrete from exposure to cold during
 placement and throughout the curing period. Maintain the concrete temperature with
 methods such as insulated forms, enclosures, and indirect heat. Vent flue gases to the
 outside of the enclosure when using combustion heaters. Prevent overheating areas or
 drying of concrete during the curing period by directing heaters and ducts away from the
 concrete surface. Do not heat the curing concrete to a temperature more than 90°F except as
 permitted in Subsection 501-3.08.2.d.
 Measure and record air temperature in the work area, away from sunlight and artificial heat,
 at approximate 12 hour intervals, at least twice each 24-hour period. Air temperature
 measurement is not required when air temperature is expected to remain above 40°F
 throughout concrete placement and the curing period.
 a. Cold temperature concreting plan submittals. Submit cold temperature concreting plan to
 the Engineer at least 5 days before beginning concrete placement when Cold Weather
 Conditions are present or expected.
 For each concrete placement include:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Procedures for the production, transport and placement
 Considerations for section size and outside air temperature during the pour
 Concrete placement temperatures
 Methods that ensure adequate curing conditions are maintained as required in
 Subsection 501-3.08
 (5) Procedures for measuring and reporting concrete temperatures
 (6) Procedures for abrupt changes in weather conditions and equipment failures
 (7) Methods for verification of in-place strength
 b. Temperature of Concrete During Batching and Placement. Obtain concrete batching and
 placement temperatures by heating the mixing water and/or aggregates.
 Avoid
 overheating aggregates so spot temperatures of aggregates do not exceed 212°F and
 average temperature of aggregates does not exceed 150°F when added to the batch.
 Ensure temperature of combined ingredients does not exceed 85°F when cementitious
 materials and admixtures are added. Ensure concrete is between 50°F and 90°F during
 placement.
 c.
 
 Preparation. Remove snow, ice, and frost from all surfaces that will touch fresh concrete.
 Thaw the subgrade to at least 2 feet below the concrete to be placed before beginning
 concrete placement.
 Preheat surfaces that will be in contact with placed concrete. Maintain these
 temperatures to no more than 10°F greater or 15°F less than that of the concrete during
 placement.
 
 d. Ending Cold Temperature Protection. Cold temperature protection may be terminated
 when the air temperature in the shade, away from artificial heat, is rising, above 40°F,
 and is expected to remain above 40°F until the end of the curing period. At the end of the
 protection period, remove the protection so the concrete surface drops in temperature
 
 170
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 gradually at a rate not more than 1.25°F per hour until the concrete temperature is within
 20°F of the air temperature in the shade, away from artificial heat. If water curing is used,
 terminate the addition of water to the surface and allow the concrete surface to dry prior
 to exposure of the concrete to freezing temperatures.
 3. Hot Temperature Protection. Do not begin concrete placement when air temperatures are
 expected to exceed 90°F during concrete placement without an approved hot temperature
 concreting plan. When air temperatures are expected to, have materials and equipment in
 place to prevent the concrete temperature from exceeding 90°F before final set and
 exceeding 150°F during the final curing period. Implement the hot temperature concreting
 plan when the air temperature in direct sunlight is greater than 90°F.
 a. Submittals. Submit a hot temperature concreting plan to the Engineer at least 5 days
 before placing concrete when the air temperature is expected to exceed 90°F during the
 concrete placement. Submit detailed procedures for the production, transport, placement,
 protection, curing, and temperature monitoring of concrete during hot temperatures for
 each concrete placement. Include procedures for abrupt changes in temperature
 conditions or equipment failures.
 b. Preparation. Prior to placing concrete, plan to minimize the exposure of the concrete to
 hot temperatures and direct sunlight. Cool surfaces that will touch the concrete to less
 than 90°F.
 Do not sprinkle fine aggregate piles with water. If sprinkling coarse aggregates, monitor
 the moisture content and adjust the mixing water for the free water in the aggregate.
 If replacing all or part of the mixing water with crushed ice, then ensure the ice is
 completely melted and thoroughly mixed with the other concrete materials before
 beginning concrete placement.
 c.
 
 Temperature of Concrete Before Placement. Ensure concrete being placed in forms is
 between 50°F and 90°F. Obtain these temperatures by cooling the mixing water and/or
 aggregate.
 
 d. Temperature of In-place Concrete. Protect the concrete from damage due to hot weather
 immediately after concrete placement and ensure adequate curing conditions are
 maintained as required in Subsection 501-3.08.
 Provide extra protection in areas especially vulnerable to temperatures above 90°F such
 as exposed top surfaces, corners and edges, thin sections, and concrete placed against
 steel.
 Protection may be terminated when the air temperature in direct sunlight drops below
 90°F and is expected to remain below 90°F for at least 24 hours.

 501-3.11 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS. Unless otherwise noted, locate construction joints where
 specified in the Contract documents. Obtain approval before adding, deleting, or relocating
 construction joints specified in the Contract documents. Make requests for such changes in
 writing, accompanied by a drawing depicting the joint. The Engineer will evaluate the proposed
 construction joint to determine if the joint will affect the strength or durability of the concrete.
 Joints noted as "permissible" do not need the Engineer's approval before deleting. When
 permitted, place the joints where they will not be exposed to view in the finished structure.
 At horizontal construction joints, place gage strips 1-1/2 inches thick inside the forms along
 exposed faces to give the joints straight lines.
 Do not use wire mesh forming material.
 If the Plans require a roughened surface on the joint, create grooves at right angles to the length
 of the member. Make grooves that are 1/2 to 1 inch wide, 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep, and spaced
 equally at twice the width of the groove. Terminate the grooves within 1-1/2 to 2 inches from the
 edges of the joint.
 If the Plans require a smooth surface on the joint, provide a trowel finish.
 Include shear keys at the joint when the Contract documents do not require a roughened surface
 or a smooth surface. Make shear keys of formed depressions with slight beveling to ensure ready
 form removal. Do not use raised shear keys. Make shear keys that meet the following:
 1. For tops of beams, at the tops and bottoms of boxed girder webs, in diaphragms, and in
 crossbeams, use shear keys 1-1/2 inches deep, 8 inches long, and spaced at 16 inches.
 2. In other locations, use shear keys at least 1-1/2 inches deep and 1/3 of the joint width.
 Terminate the shear keys within 1-1/2 to 2 inches of the joint edge.
 Clean construction joints of surface laitance and other foreign materials before fresh concrete is
 placed against the surface of the joint. Flush construction joints with water and allow the joint to
 dry to a surface-dry condition immediately prior to placing concrete.

 provided in the Plans for the construction and erection of the members. Cast members only
 
 173
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 after shop drawings are approved. Use precast methods for cast-in-place elements when
 approved. Submit shop drawings, showing construction joint details and other required
 information.
 2. Manufacture. Prestress concrete according to Section 502. Fabricate and install reinforcing
 steel according to Section 503.
 Unless otherwise noted, use Class P concrete for precast concrete members meeting the
 Specified Compressive Strength noted on the Plans.
 3. Storage and Handling. Handle and move precast concrete members without damage. Store
 and transport precast concrete members in an upright position with the directions of the
 support reactions on the member during storage or transport as if in the final position. Locate
 support points during transport and storage within 30 inches of their final position, or as
 shown on approved shop drawings. Ship only after the member has cured at least 7 days and
 has a compressive strength not less than 100 percent of the Specified Compressive Strength.
 4. Erection. Maintain member stability during transport, lifting, and erection operations. Limit
 concrete tension stresses due to transport, lifting, and erection operations to less than 500
 psi.
 Set interchangeable precast concrete members so the initial difference between the top
 surfaces of the edges of adjacent precast concrete members is no more than 1/2 inch at
 midspan and no more than 1/4 inch at the bearings.
 Set and securely brace precast concrete members within a span before making shear
 connections. Secure the member to the structure, and provide temporary braces necessary
 to resist wind or other loads immediately after erecting each precast concrete member.
 Provide and use forcing devices as shown in the Plans or as recommended by the precast
 concrete member manufacturer. Use devices maintaining the top edges of adjacent members
 at the same elevation while casting or welding diaphragms, welding shear connector plates,
 and while placing and curing grout in the shear keys.
 Make field welds according to Section 503 and Section 504.
 Install cast-in-place diaphragms within 2 weeks after setting precast concrete members on
 their bearings.
 If cast-in-place diaphragms cannot be placed within the prescribed time limit, ensure the
 members are adequately braced to resist movement and rotation. Submit a bracing plan
 including complete details and substantiating calculations, sealed by a Professional Engineer
 registered in the State of Alaska.
 Erect and place precast deck panels so the mating surfaces do not allow grout leakage. Seal
 joints where grout leakage may occur.
 When the Plans require filling keyways between adjacent concrete members with grout, place
 grout according to the manufacturer's written instructions. Clean joints of surface laitance and
 other foreign material before placing grout. Do not place loads on the grouted members until
 the grout compressive strength has reached 5000 psi.
 Tightly pack and rod the grout in the keys and spaces. Keep the grout surface smooth and
 neat. Ensure the grout surface meets the member edges throughout their lengths and
 matches the surface elevation of the members with a tolerance of ±1/8 inch.

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 501-3.14 PLACING ANCHOR BOLTS. Secure anchor bolt assemblies where shown on the
 Plans.
 When casting anchor bolts in concrete, secure anchor bolts before placing concrete in the forms.
 Do not disturb anchor bolts after concrete has been placed.
 When installing anchor bolts in pipe sleeves, pre-cast holes, cored holes, or drilled holes,
 completely fill the cavity with grout. Do not allow water to freeze in the cavity. Do not allow foreign
 material in the cavity.
 501-3.15 UTILIDUCTS, PIPES, CONDUITS, DUCTS, AND UTILITY HOLES. When utiliducts,
 pipes, conduits, and ducts will be encased in concrete, install them in the forms before placing the
 concrete. Support the utiliducts, pipes, conduits, and ducts to prevent displacement during
 concrete placement.
 Install utiliducts and utility holes parallel to the roadway centerline unless noted otherwise.
 Prevent bond between the utiliducts and concrete by tightly wrapping the utiliducts with at least
 two layers of asphalt felt.
 501-3.16 REMOVING CONCRETE. Do not damage other portions of the structure remaining in
 place when removing concrete.
 Determine and delineate the extent of removal area. Outline the area with a 3/4-inch deep saw
 cut to form faces perpendicular to the surface prior to the removal of concrete. Do not cut or
 damage existing reinforcing steel or prestressing steel. During the course of removal, the
 Engineer may suspend removal or may require additional removal and outline saw cut.
 Use any combination of mechanical methods, water-blast cleaning, or abrasive-blast cleaning to
 remove coarse or broken concrete until a dense, uniform surface of concrete exposing solid
 coarse aggregate is obtained. When using mechanical methods for removal of concrete, meet the
 following:
 1. Use impact tools weighing less than 15 lbs.
 2. Operate impact tools at an angle less than 45 degrees relative to the surface of the concrete
 being removed.
 3. Use hand tools such as hammers and chisels or small air chisels, water blast cleaning, or
 abrasive blast cleaning to remove final particles of unsound concrete.
 During the removal operation do not damage existing reinforcing steel, prestressing steel, or
 concrete to remain in place.
 Before applying the repair material, clean the surface according to ASTM D4258 within 24 hours
 of applying the repair material.
 Use water meeting the requirements of Subsection 712-2.01 for removal operations.
 501-3.17 CRACK EVALUATION. The Engineer will evaluate concrete that is cracked during
 execution of the Contract. Measure cracks at their widest point.
 For concrete decks and approach slabs, allow the Engineer to inspect any surface cracking
 immediately after termination of concrete curing operations, before prestressing (if applicable),
 and before releasing falsework. If any 500 square foot portion of the concrete deck or approach
 slab has cracks, whose width exceeds 0.020 inches and combined lengths total more than 16
 feet, treat the surface by performing low-viscosity resin crack repair.
 
 175
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 For other concrete, cracks will be evaluated based on the crack width.
 1. For crack widths equal to and greater than 0.060 inches, the concrete will be considered
 unacceptable.
 2. For cracks widths equal to and greater than 0.013 inches but less than 0.060 inches, the
 Engineer will evaluate the cracked concrete for structural adequacy and durability. If the
 Engineer determines the crack may affect structural adequacy or durability, the Engineer may
 reject the concrete, the structure, or a portion of the structure. If the Engineer determines the
 cracked concrete is acceptable, repair the crack by performing low-pressure crack repair
 according to Subsection 501-3.18.
 3. For cracks widths less than 0.013 inches wide, the crack will be considered acceptable with
 no additional evaluation or repairs required.
 501-3.18 CRACK REPAIR. Perform crack repairs and replace unacceptable concrete at no cost
 to the Department. No contract time extension will be given for repairing, removing, and replacing
 unacceptable material.
 1. Low-Pressure Crack Repair. Repair cracked concrete according to the following
 requirements:
 a. Crack Repair Plan. Submit a crack repair plan to the Engineer. Do not repair the crack
 until the Engineer has approved the crack repair plan. Include the following in the crack
 repair plan:
 (1) Experience of the injection equipment technicians
 (2) Evaluation of the crack width and the recommended epoxy viscosity allowing the
 epoxy to achieve and maintain the penetration requirements
 (3) Material information including manufacturer's product data sheets
 (4) Equipment
 (5) Crack preparation, injection procedures, and injection sequence
 (6) Cleanup procedures
 b. Experience. Provide epoxy injection technicians who have a minimum of 2 years
 experience in performing repairs using the methods and materials of the selected system.
 c.
 
 Materials. Use epoxy adhesive for crack injection with viscosity capable of filling at least
 90 percent of the crack volume. Use epoxy adhesive for crack sealing capable of
 containing the epoxy adhesive for crack injection.
 
 d. Equipment. Use positive displacement plural component pumps, specifically designed to
 meter, mix, and to inject epoxy, and capable of filling at least 90 percent of the crack
 volume.
 e. Surface and Crack Preparation. Remove contaminants and other foreign material
 reducing the effectiveness of the surface seal and repaired crack. Allow adequate time
 for drying. If cleaning solutions are used, perform trial tests to verify the contaminants can
 be removed. Prepare the surface and crack according to the epoxy manufacturer’s
 instructions.
 
 176
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 501
 
 f.
 
 Entry and Venting Ports. Install entry/venting ports spaced equal to the thickness of the
 concrete member along one face of the crack. Acceptable types of entry/venting ports are
 fittings inserted into drilled holes, bonded flush fittings, and gasket devices covering
 unsealed portions of interrupted seals, allowing injection of epoxy directly into the crack
 without leaking epoxy.
 
 g. Mixing Epoxy for Crack Sealing. Mix the epoxy adhesive for crack sealing to the volume
 ratio prescribed by the manufacturer.
 h. Surface Sealing. Seal the surface of the crack with epoxy adhesive for crack sealing.
 i.
 
 Mixing Epoxy for Crack Injection. Mix the epoxy adhesive for crack injection to the
 volume ratio prescribed by the manufacturer.
 
 j.
 
 Epoxy Injection. Assure the crack seal is cured and capable of containing the crack
 injection epoxy. Inject the epoxy according to the epoxy manufacturer’s instructions. Do
 not inject epoxy until the air, substrate, and epoxy are within the manufacturer's
 application temperature range. Limit injection pressure to prevent propagation of the
 crack, prevent additional damage, and injection pressure in excess of 50 psi.
 Inject the epoxy in the sequence noted in the approved crack repair plan. Ensure at least
 90 percent of the crack volume is filled.
 Maintain the epoxy temperature within the manufacturer's application temperature range
 during injection operations and until the epoxy is cured.
 
 k.
 
 Finishing and Cleanup. After the injected epoxy is cured, remove ports and surface seal
 flush with the concrete surface. Do not damage the injected epoxy and do not heat the
 surface seal to aid in removal.
 
 2. Low-Viscosity Resin Crack Repair. When concrete deck or approach slab crack repair is
 required, the Engineer will define the repair area with the following boundary limits:
 a. Beginning and ending on straight lines perpendicular to the direction of traffic and
 extending across the entire width of the concrete deck or approach slab, between the
 concrete barriers or curbs.
 b. Beginning and ending at least 5 feet beyond the furthest opposing cracks, measured from
 where the crack widths exceeds 0.020 inches
 If grinding is required, treat the concrete before grinding.
 Before treatment, ensure the concrete surface is clean, sound and free of foreign materials
 that may reduce the effectiveness of the repaired cracks. If the concrete surface becomes
 contaminated before placing the resin, repeat the cleaning process.
 Apply low-viscosity resin to the repair area. Protect barriers, railing, joints, and drainage
 facilities to prevent contamination by the treatment material.
 Completely cover the deck surface with resin so the resin penetrates and fills cracks. Ensure
 the relative humidity is less than 80 percent, the prepared area is dry, and the surface
 temperature is at least 50°F and not more than 90°F when the resin is applied. Apply the
 resin and distribute excess material within the manufacturer's listed pot life. For textured
 surfaces, including grooved surfaces, remove excess material from the texture indentations.
 For concrete decks and approach slabs not receiving a waterproofing membrane, apply
 aggregate for abrasive finish within 20 minutes of resin application and before setting occurs.

 magnitude and distribution of prestressing force specified in the Contract documents.
 1. Shop Drawings. Before casting members to be prestressed, submit for approval shop
 drawings including complete details and substantiating calculations of the method, materials,
 and equipment proposed for use in the prestressing operations, any additions or
 rearrangement of reinforcing steel, and any revision in concrete dimensions.
 Include an outline of the method and sequence of stressing, complete specifications and
 details of the prestressing steel and anchoring devices to be used, anchoring stresses, strand
 release sequence, and other data pertaining to the prestressing operations, including the
 proposed arrangement of the prestressing units in the members.
 Compute the anticipated camber at the time of prestressing force transfer and at other
 significant times. Show the values on the shop drawings as a time/deflection curve, subject to
 approval.
 Include on shop drawings embedded items such as reinforcing steel, lifting devices, coil
 anchors, anchor bolts, drainage systems, utility conduits and other such items. Ensure there
 
 180
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 will be no conflict between the planned positions of any embedded items and that concrete
 cover will be adequate.
 2. Quality Control Plan. Submit a quality control plan that verifies that all materials and
 workmanship incorporated into the prestressed concrete members conform to the
 requirements.
 Perform pretensioning operations under the direct supervision and control of a qualified
 pretensioning technician. Provide a pretensioning technician, skilled in the prestressing
 method, to aid and instruct in using the prestressing equipment and in installing the materials
 to obtain required results.
 3. Protection of Prestressing Steel. Protect prestressing steel and anchor assemblies against
 physical damage and corrosion. Keep prestressing steel and anchor assemblies clean and
 free of deleterious material such as grease, oil, wax, paint, or other foreign materials. The
 Engineer will reject prestressing steel that has at any time sustained physical damage. The
 Engineer will reject prestressing steel that has developed visible rust pitting or other results of
 corrosion, other than rust stain.
 Protect prestressing steel and anchorage assemblies against physical damage and corrosion
 during shipping and storage by packaging the prestressing steel and anchorage assemblies
 in containers or shipping forms. Place a corrosion inhibitor in the package or form,
 incorporate a corrosion inhibitor carrier-type packaging material, or apply a corrosion inhibitor
 directly to the steel. Do not use corrosion inhibitors that have deleterious effect on the steel or
 concrete or bond strength of steel to concrete. Immediately replace packaging or forms
 damaged from any cause or restore packaging to original condition.
 Clearly mark the shipping package or form with a statement that the package contains highstrength prestressing steel, and the type of corrosion inhibitor used, including the date
 packaged.
 4. Prestressing Equipment. Use hydraulic jacks to tension prestressing steel strands so the
 force in the prestressing steel will not be less than the value specified in the Contract
 documents or as approved by the Engineer.
 Equip each jack used to stress strands with either:
 a. two calibrated pressure gages, or
 b. one calibrated pressure gage and one calibrated load cell
 In the event that any uncertainty exists regarding jack calibration, pressure gage usage,
 strand elongation or any other prestressing strand tensioning issue, provide and use a
 calibrated load cell when prestressing steel strands.
 Permanently mark the jack body with the ram area. Ensure each pressure gage is fully
 functional, calibrated and has an accurately reading dial at least 6 inches in diameter.
 Calibrate the jack and each gage, used to stress strands, as a unit within 6 months prior to
 use and after each repair. If used, provide a load cell calibrated within the past 12 months
 with an indicator that may be used to determine the prestressing force in the strand. The
 range of the load cell shall be such that the lower 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated
 capacity will not be used in determining the jacking stress.
 Use the following calibration procedure; Perform three calibration test cycles with the cylinder
 extension of the jack in various positions (i.e. 2 inch, 4 inch, 8 inch stroke). At each pressure
 increment, average the forces from each test cycle to obtain an average force. Perform the
 
 181
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 calibration with the equipment setup in the same configuration that will be used at the job site.
 Use load cells calibrated within the past 12 months to calibrate stressing equipment.
 For each jack and gauge unit used on the project, provide certified calibration curves prior to
 the start of the work and every 6 months thereafter, or as requested by the Engineer. If used,
 supply documentation denoting the load cell calibration date prior to the start of the work and
 every 6 months thereafter. Furnish certified calibration charts prior to stressing.
 Recalibrate jacks requiring repair, such as replacing seals or changing the length of the
 hydraulic lines. No extra compensation will be allowed for the initial or subsequent
 calibrations.
 5. Placing Reinforcing Steel and Prestressing Steel. Place reinforcing steel according to Section
 503, except as modified by this Section.
 Place prestressing steel in the position required in the Contract documents or on the
 approved shop drawings.
 6. Girder Inserts. Provide threaded inserts, coil anchors, or approved equal in the girder as
 required in the Contract documents.
 With the written approval of the Engineer, additional inserts in the girder may be provided to
 accommodate diaphragm forms or other construction related requirements.
 Provide holes in the girder web as indicated on the plans to accommodate reinforcing steel.
 Verify that the hole size is sufficient to accommodate reinforcement placement procedures.
 7. Pretensioning. Stress strands to the magnitude specified in the Contract documents by either
 single strand stressing or multiple strand stressing. Prior to applying full pretensioning, bring
 all strands to be stressed in a group (multiple strand stressing) to a uniform initial tension that
 is sufficient to eliminate all slack and equalize the stresses in the strands. Limit the strand
 stress in pretensioned members before seating (jacking stress) to 70 percent of the minimum
 breaking strength (0.70 fpu) of the prestressing steel.
 Ensure that the tension load indicated by the gauge(s) is within 5 percent of the calculated
 tension load based on elongation measurements for each strand.
 Use approved low-friction devices at points of change in slope of strand trajectory when
 tensioning harped strands.
 Tension harped strands from both ends of the bed if the prestressing force, as determined by
 elongation measurements, is less than 95 percent of that indicated by the jack gauges.
 Ensure the computed load from the sum of elongation at both ends is within 5 percent of that
 indicated by the jack gauges.
 When splicing strands, locate splices outside of the prestressed units. Account for additional
 elongation due to the splice when verifying the tension load based on elongation
 measurements.
 Keep the temperature of the strands during tensioning and concrete placement within 25 °F
 of the concrete temperature during placement. During the interval between tensioning and
 concrete placement, do not let temperature changes alter the stress level in the strands more
 than 5 percent of the jacking stress, nor cause the stress in the strand to exceed 75 percent
 of the minimum breaking strength.
 8. Placing Concrete. Produce and place concrete according to the requirements of Section 501,
 except as modified by this section.
 
 182
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 Before depositing concrete in the forms, obtain an inspection of the reinforcing steel,
 enclosures, anchorages, and prestressing steel by an authorized Department representative.
 Consolidate the concrete using any combination of internal and external vibration that does
 not displace the reinforcing steel or other items embedded in the concrete.
 9. Release. Do not release prestressing strands or transfer prestressing forces to the member
 until concrete cylinder tests, manufactured according to AASHTO T 23 and tested according
 to AASHTO T 22 using the same concrete and maintained in the same curing conditions as
 the member, indicate that the concrete has attained the minimum initial compressive strength
 (release strength, f'ci) as indicated in the Contract documents.
 Cut or release the elements in an order that minimizes the lateral eccentricity of the prestress. Cut all prestressing strands to a depth of at least 1 inch from the concrete surface. Fill
 the recess with cement mortar and finish flush to the concrete surface. Alternatively, cut all
 prestressing strands flush with the end of the member. Clean the exposed ends of the strand
 and a 1-inch strip of adjoining concrete to remove all dirt and residue not firmly bonded to the
 metal or concrete surfaces.
 If the member's curing is accelerated according to Section 501, transfer the stressing force to
 the concrete immediately after the heating cycle has been discontinued, while the concrete is
 still moist, and before the temperature of the concrete drops below 100°F.
 502-3.02 POST-TENSIONING METHODS. Select a post-tensioning system that provides the
 magnitude and distribution of prestressing force specified in the Contract documents.
 For box girders, distribute the prestressing steel so the force in each girder stem does not vary
 more than 5 percent from the required force per girder stem and the required total force in the
 superstructure is obtained and distributed symmetrically about the centerline of the typical
 section.
 Do not exceed 75 percent of the minimum breaking strength of the prestressing steel for
 maximum temporary tensile stresses (jacking stresses) in prestressing steel. Do not exceed 70
 percent of the minimum breaking strength of the prestressing steel at anchorages after anchor
 set.
 Working force and working stress will be considered as the force and stress remaining in the
 prestressing steel after all losses (e.g., creep and shrinkage of concrete, elastic compression of
 concrete, creep of steel, losses in post-tensioned prestressing steel due to sequence of stressing,
 friction and take up of anchorages and all other losses peculiar to the method or system of
 prestressing) have taken place or have been accommodated. Calculate loss of prestress using
 industry recognized methods. The calculation and analysis methods are subject to approval by
 the Engineer.
 1. Shop Drawings and Calculations. Before casting members to be prestressed, submit shop
 drawings and supporting calculations of the prestressing system for approval no less than 45
 days prior to the placement of bridge concrete.
 Provide complete details on the shop drawings of the prestressing system and substantiating
 calculations of the method, materials, and equipment to be used in the prestressing
 operations, including any additions or rearrangement of reinforcing steel and any revision in
 concrete dimensions from that shown on the Plans. Outline in sufficient detail the method and
 sequence of stressing. Include complete specifications and details of the prestressing steel
 and anchoring assemblies, working stresses, anchoring stresses, type of ducts, initial
 prestress losses, final prestress losses and all other data pertaining to the prestressing
 operation. Show tendon geometry and locations complying with the plans and the limitations
 of the selected post-tensioning system. Show all vent locations, high point outlet inspection
 
 183
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 details, anchorage inspection details and grout caps, protection system materials and
 application limits. Include on the shop drawing the location of the anchorages, vents, and
 duct enclosures at 2-foot (maximum) intervals along the length of the member.
 Submit calculations for the anticipated camber at the time of prestressing force transfer and
 at other significant times. Show the values on the shop drawings as a time/deflection curve.
 Submit calculations for the anticipated tendon elongation. Utilize the modulus of elasticity,
 based on nominal area, as furnished by the prestressing steel manufacturer for the lot of
 steel being tensioned. Show a typical tendon force diagram, after friction, wobble and anchor
 set losses, on the shop drawings based upon the expected friction curvature and wobble
 coefficients and values for the post-tensioning system used. Show the coefficients and values
 on the shop drawings.
 Provide shop drawings, calculation, and procedures related to post-tensioning, prepared and
 sealed by a Professional Engineer, registered in the State of Alaska who specializes in posttensioning concrete. Bear the signature and seal of the Professional Engineer who
 specializes in post-tensioning construction on all calculations, drawings, and procedures.
 Include post-tensioning system certification(s) conforming to Section 721.
 2. Post-tensioning and Grouting Technicians. Perform post-tensioning field operations under the
 direct supervision of a qualified post-tensioning technician. Provide a post-tensioning
 technician with at least 5 years of experience in construction of post-tensioned prestressed
 concrete structures. Provide a technician, skilled in the prestressing method, to aid and
 instruct in using the prestressing equipment and in installing the materials to obtain required
 results.
 Perform grouting under the direct supervision of a certified grouting technician. Provide a
 technician skilled in various aspects of grouting whom the American Segmental Bridge
 Institute certifies as an "ASBI Certified Grouting Technician".
 Ensure the post-tensioning technician is present at all times during duct installation, tendon
 tensioning, and grouting operations and provides close observation and control of all posttensioning and grouting operations, as necessary for compliance with the Contract. Submit
 the name of the post-tensioning technician and proof of certification no less than 30 days
 before the start of bridge concrete placement operations.
 3. Protection of Prestressing Steel and Anchorages. Protect prestressing steel and anchor
 assemblies against physical damage and corrosion. Keep prestressing steel and anchor
 assemblies clean and free of deleterious material such as grease, oil, wax, paint, or other
 foreign materials. The Engineer will reject prestressing steel that has at any time sustained
 physical damage. The Engineer will reject prestressing steel that has developed visible rust
 pitting or other results of corrosion, other than rust stain.
 Protect prestressing steel and anchorage assemblies against physical damage and corrosion
 during shipping and storage by packaging the prestressing steel and anchorage assemblies
 in containers or shipping forms. Place a corrosion inhibitor in the package or form,
 incorporate a corrosion inhibitor carrier-type packaging material, or apply a corrosion inhibitor
 directly to the steel. Do not use corrosion inhibitors that have deleterious effect on the steel or
 concrete or bond strength of steel to concrete. Immediately replace packaging or forms
 damaged from any cause or restore packaging to original condition.
 Clearly mark the shipping package or form with a statement that the package contains highstrength prestressing steel, and the type of corrosion inhibitor used, including the date
 packaged.
 
 184
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 If prestressing steel is installed in ducts but not tensioned and grouted within the 7 days,
 perform Nondestructive Examination (NDE) by either videoscoping the entire length of the
 prestressing steel inside the ducts or visually inspecting the prestressing steel upon removing
 the prestressing steel from the duct for corrosion. Perform NDE inspection at least once
 every 7 days until the prestressing steel is tensioned and grouted. Perform NDE inspection to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer. Provide a report of the tendon condition following each NDE
 inspection for each tendon installation.
 If corrosion is not found on the prestressing steel upon completion of NDE inspection, the
 Engineer may require protecting prestressing steel corrosion by means of a corrosion
 inhibitor placed in the ducts. Do not place a corrosion inhibitor inside the duct if prestressing
 steel installation, tensioning, and grouting is performed within 7 days. Do not use corrosion
 inhibitors that have deleterious effect on the steel or concrete or bond strength of steel to
 concrete. Submit for approval the name, manufacturer, and type of corrosion inhibitor to be
 used in the ducts at least 7 days before installation of any prestressing steel. Prior to
 grouting, flush the corrosion inhibitor from the ducts using a solution of quick lime (calcium
 oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) in the amount of 0.1 lbs/gal. Use compressed air
 that is oil free to blow out ducts and remove flush water.
 Cover and protect the anchorages against corrosion at all times from installation of the
 prestressing steel to placement of the concrete pour-backs.
 Do not weld on or near prestressing steel, ducts, anchorages, or other assemblages. Protect
 prestressing steel and hardware from weld spatter or other damage. Once the prestressing
 steel has been installed, do not make welds or grounds for welders on the forms, reinforcing
 steel, or adjacent steel members.
 4. Prestressing Equipment. Use hydraulic jacks to tension prestressing steel tendons so that the
 force in the prestressing steel will not be less than the value specified in the Contract
 documents or as approved by the Engineer. Do not use monostrand jacks to stress multistrand tendons.
 Equip each jack used to stress tendons with either:
 a. two pressure gages
 b. one pressure gage and one load cell
 In the event that any uncertainty exists regarding jack calibration, pressure gage usage,
 strand elongation or any other prestressing strand tensioning issue, provide and use a
 calibrated load cell when prestressing steel tendons.
 Permanently mark the jack body with the ram area. Ensure each pressure gage is fully
 functional, calibrated and has an accurately reading dial at least 6 inches in diameter.
 Calibrate the jack and each gage used to stress tendons as a unit within 6 months prior to
 use and after each repair. If used, provide a load cell calibrated within the past 12 months
 with an indicator that may be used to determine the prestressing force in the tendon. The
 range of the load cell shall be such that the lower 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated
 capacity will not be used in determining the jacking stress.
 Use the following calibration procedure; Perform three calibration test cycles with the cylinder
 extension of the jack in various positions (i.e. 2 inch, 4 inch, 8 inch stroke). At each pressure
 increment, average the forces from each test cycle to obtain an average force. Perform the
 calibration with the equipment setup in the same configuration that will be used at the job site.
 Use load cells calibrated within the past 12 months to calibrate stressing equipment.
 
 185
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 For each jack and gauge unit used on the project, provide the Engineer with certified
 calibration curves prior to the start of the work and every 6 months thereafter, or as requested
 by the Engineer. If used, supply documentation denoting the load cell calibration date prior to
 the start of the work and every 6 months thereafter. Furnish certified calibration charts prior to
 stressing.
 5. Enclosures for Post-Tensioning. Accurately place enclosures (anchorages, ducts, and vents)
 for prestressing reinforcing according to the Plans or approved shop drawings.
 Set and hold the anchorage assemblies and block-out templates for anchorages so their axis
 coincides with the axis of the tendon and the wedge plates are normal in all directions to the
 tendon. Securely fasten anchorages and block-outs to prevent displacement during concrete
 placement. Unless otherwise specified in the Contract documents or shown on the approved
 shop drawings, recess the anchoring assemblies in formed block-outs so that the ends of the
 prestressing steel and all parts of the anchoring assemblies will be at least 3 inches inside of
 the end surface of the member. Construct block-outs in leak proof forms that create neat lines
 with the end surface of the member.
 Securely fasten ducts at the proper locations in the forms by ties to reinforcing steel that are
 adequate to prevent displacement during concrete placement. Use supplementary support
 bars where needed to maintain proper alignment of the duct. Use hold-down ties to prevent
 displacement due to duct buoyancy in the fluid concrete. Fasten ducts at 2-foot maximum
 intervals along the member.
 Do not damage the ducts during installation. Do not crimp, flatten, or dent the ducts. Do not
 perforate the ducts or provide openings in the ducts except at locations designated in the
 Contract documents or shop drawings. After duct installation, inspect all ducts for damage.
 The Engineer will reject ducts with unintentional holes or openings and ducts that are dented,
 crimped, or flattened. Repair duct sections to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no additional
 cost to the Department and no adjustment in Contract time.
 After installation in the forms, cover the ends of the ducts and anchorages at all times to
 prevent the entry of water or debris.
 Prior to placing forms for closing slabs of box girder cells, demonstrate that the ducts are
 unobstructed.
 6. Location of Grout Vents. Place grout vents at locations designated in the Contract documents
 and shop drawings. Equip grout vents with positive shut-off devices. Extend grout tubes with
 sufficient distance out of the concrete member to allow for proper closing of the valves.
 7. Placing Reinforcing Steel and Prestressing Steel. Place reinforcing steel according to the
 requirements of Section 503 and as modified by this Section.
 Place prestressing steel in the position as designated in the Contract documents or on the
 approved shop drawings. Install the prestressing steel in the enclosures by pushing or pulling
 the total number of strands in a tendon individually or as a unit.
 For strands that are pushed, round off the end of the strand and fit the end of the strand with
 a smooth protective cap.
 For strands that are pulled, use a special steel wire sock or other device attached to the end
 strands to pull the assembled tendon through the duct. Do not weld the ends of the strands
 together for this purpose. Round the end of the pre-assembled tendon for smooth passage
 through the duct. Cut strands using an abrasive saw or equal. Do not flame cut strands.
 
 186
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 Immediately prior to installing the prestressing steel, demonstrate that the ducts are free of
 water, debris, and obstructions by passing a torpedo through the ducts. Use a torpedo having
 the same cross-sectional shape as the duct and is 1/4 inch smaller all around than the clear,
 nominal inside dimensions of the duct. Make no deductions to the torpedo section
 dimensions for tolerances allowed in the manufacture or fixing of the ducts. For straight
 ducts, use a torpedo at least 2 feet long. For curved ducts, determine the length so that when
 both ends touch the outermost wall of the duct, the torpedo is 1/4 inch clear of the innermost
 wall. If the torpedo will not travel completely through the duct, the Engineer will reject the
 member, unless a workable repair can be made to clear the duct. Ensure the torpedo passes
 through the duct easily, by hand, without resorting to excessive effort or mechanical
 assistance.
 If the strands do not easily pass through the duct or an obstruction is encountered, do not
 force strands through the duct.
 Do not install the prestressing steel in the duct prior to placing and curing of the concrete.
 Straighten prestressing steel strands that are to be stressed simultaneously or when
 necessary to ensure proper positioning in the ducts.
 8. Placing Concrete. Produce and place concrete according to the requirements of Section 501
 and as modified by this section.
 Before depositing concrete in the forms, obtain an inspection and approval of the placement
 of reinforcing, enclosures, anchorages, and prestressing steel. Vibrate the concrete internally,
 externally, or both. Vibrate carefully to avoid displacing the reinforcing steel, anchorages,
 ducts, grout vents, or other items embedded in the concrete.
 9. Post-tensioning. Do not begin tensioning operations until concrete cylinder tests,
 manufactured according to AASHTO T 23 and tested according to AASHTO T 22 using the
 same concrete and maintained in the same curing conditions as the member, indicate that
 the concrete has attained the minimum initial compressive strength (release strength, f'ci)
 indicated in the Contract documents. Do not begin tensioning operations until after the
 Engineer approved patches or repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Do not tension the
 prestressing steel until all concrete in the member has been placed.
 Perform stressing of tendons in conformance with the sequence shown on the approved shop
 drawings. Stress tendons in such a sequence that lateral eccentricity of prestress and loss of
 prestress will be a minimum. Stress tendons symmetrically about the center of the typical
 section so no more than one tendon is eccentric about the centerline at any one time.
 Sequence the stressing of the tendons so the individual tendon force does not exceed the
 tendon force in other tendons by more than 50 percent of the final jacking force of the tendon.
 Stress strands in each tendon simultaneously. Stress tendons by jacking from only one end
 of the member unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Conduct the tensioning process so that tension being applied and the elongation of the
 prestressing steel may be measured at all times. Measure elongation to the nearest 1/16
 inch. Tension tendons to a preliminary force between 5 and 25 percent of the final jacking
 force to eliminate any wedge slip or take-up in the tensioning system before elongation
 measurements are started. Record the preliminary force so that it can be used in the
 elongation measurement. Mark at least 25 percent of the strands in each tendon prior to final
 stressing to permit measurement of elongation and to ensure the anchor wedges are set
 properly.
 For the required tendon force, ensure the observed elongation agrees within 5 percent of the
 theoretical tendon elongation. In the event the observed elongation is not within acceptable
 
 187
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 tolerances, determine the source of error and revise the post-tensioning operation to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer before proceeding. Do not overstress the tendon to achieve the
 theoretical elongation.
 Multi-strand post-tensioning tendons having wires that fail, by breaking or slippage during
 stressing, will be rejected.
 Cut post-tensioning steel with an abrasive saw within 1 to 2 inches from the anchoring
 device. Do not flame cut prestressing steel.
 Provide a record of the post-tensioning operation following each tendon installation including,
 but not limited to, the following:
 a. Project name and bridge number;
 b. Contractor and / or subcontractor name;
 c.
 
 Tendon location, size, type;
 
 d. Date and time tendon was first installed in the duct;
 e. Reel number for strands;
 f.
 
 Tendon cross-sectional area;
 
 g. Modulus of elasticity;
 h. Date and time tendon was stressed;
 i.
 
 Jack and gage numbers per end of tendon;
 
 j.
 
 Required jacking force;
 
 k.

 o. Stressing mode (one end/ two ends/ simultaneous);
 p. Witnesses to stressing operation (signature); and
 q. Date grouted.
 Cover ends of tendons and anchorages immediately after stressing in accordance with
 Subsection 502-3.02.3.
 502-3.03 CAMBER. Camber is the upward deflection that occurs in prestressed concrete flexural
 members due to the combination of stressing forces and dead load. It does not include
 dimensional inaccuracies from manufacturing errors.
 Form girders so the roadway surface conforms to the indicated grade line with an allowance for
 1/2 inch of positive camber at midspan. Form girders to adjust for the predicted long-term camber
 from loss of prestress and from dead load deflection. When estimating this adjustment, assume
 that future paving will be applied 3 years after erection.
 
 188
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 Control the concrete properties and the placing, curing, curing times, tensioning procedures, and
 the storage of precast prestressed beam sections. Control these elements so that the shape and
 amplitude of the deflection curves for all girders will be within specified tolerances and as nearly
 alike as possible.
 Measure camber with the girder supported at bearing points only. When it is impractical to
 support the girder on its bearing points, you may use alternative support points. Obtain approval
 of the alternative supports and submit calculations of the effects of the supports on girder camber.
 Measure actual camber during prestressing force transfer and compare it with computed values
 and tolerances.
 502-3.04 TOLERANCES. Produce prestressed concrete members conforming to the following
 dimensional tolerances:
 1. Camber: Do not vary from approved camber more than ±1/8 inch per 10 feet of length, but
 not to exceed 1 inch. In addition, the camber of any girder may not differ from that of any
 other girder by more than 1 inch.
 2. Position of Strands: ±1/4 inch (±1/2 inch where harped strands exit the member).
 3. Longitudinal Position of Deflection Point for Harped Strands: ±12 inches.
 4. Position of Ducts and Anchorages: ±1/4 inch
 5. Position of Local Zone Reinforcement: Center reinforcement on the duct and start within 1/2
 inch of the back of the bearing plate.

 operation, including their relevant certification, experience, and skill.
 Do not commence production grouting until the Engineer provides written approval of the
 grouting operation plan.
 Before initiation of production grouting, conduct a joint meeting with the grouting technician,
 subcontractors, grouting crew, and the Engineer to discuss the grouting operation plan,
 required testing, corrective procedures, and other relevant issues.
 4. Grout Storage. Store all grout materials in a dry enclosure or building that is convenient to the
 work site. Limit on site storage of grout to a maximum period of one month.
 5. Grout Production Tests. Carry out the minimum number of production grout tests as follows:
 a. Grout Strength Test. Prepare grout cube specimens according to ASTM C942. Perform a
 minimum of one strength test per day during grouting operations. Submit strength test
 results within 24 hours of test completion.
 b. Fluidity test. Perform the modified version of ASTM C939 test specified in Subsection
 701-2.08. Repeat testing at least every 2 hours of grouting operations. Submit fluidity test
 results within 24 hours of test completion.
 6. Field Trial Test. Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the grouting equipment,
 methods, and procedures are appropriate. Conduct field trial tests at least 7 days prior to
 initiation of production grouting or as specified by the Engineer. Perform batching and testing
 with the same materials, personnel, and equipment used in production grouting. Furnish all
 materials and labor at no cost to the Department.
 7. Preparation of Enclosures. If a corrosion inhibitor or any other material other than
 prestressing steel is inside the duct, flush the ducts using a solution of quick lime (calcium
 oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) in the amount of 0.1 lbs/gal.
 Blow duct with oil free compressed air to remove water and debris blockages that may
 interfere with the injection of grout.
 Inspect valves to be sure that they can be opened and closed properly. Check that the grout
 hose connections and inlets are free of dirt.
 8. Equipment. Provide grouting equipment consisting of measuring devices for water, a highspeed shear colloidal mixer, a storage hopper (holding reservoir) and a pump with all the
 necessary connecting hoses, valves, and pressure gauge. Provide grouting equipment with
 sufficient capacity to ensure that the post-tensioning ducts to be grouted can be filled and
 vented without interruption in less than 20 minutes.
 Provide an air compressor, flushing equipment, and hoses with sufficient output to perform
 the required functions.
 
 190
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 If voids that cannot be completely filled using grout injection equipment are present after the
 grouting operation is complete, then provide vacuum grouting equipment (volumetric
 measuring type). No additional compensation will be made in the event that vacuum grouting
 equipment is required.
 Provide the following equipment:
 a. Mixing Equipment. Provide a high speed shear colloidal mixer capable of continuous
 mechanical mixing producing a homogeneous and stable grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. Use only colloidal grout machinery that has separate charging and
 storage tanks. Equip the charging tank with a high shear colloidal mixer and fit the
 storage tank with an agitator to keep the grout moving continuously before it is pumped
 into the duct. Use grouting equipment with a gravity feed to the pump inlet from the
 storage tank.
 Include a screen having clear openings of 1/8 inch maximum size to screen the grout
 prior to its introduction into the grout pump or storage hopper. Locate the screen between
 the charging tank and the storage tank so that the screen is easily accessible for
 inspection and cleaning.
 Keep the holding tank agitated and at least 1/4 full at all times during the pumping
 operation to prevent air from being drawn into the post-tensioning duct.
 Periodically inspect the screen during grouting operations. Do not use grout if lumps of
 cement remain on the screen.
 Add water during the initial mixing by use of a calibrated flow meter or calibrated water
 reservoir with a measuring accuracy equal to one percent of the total water volume.
 Where water is not supplied through the public water supply system, provide a water
 storage tank of sufficient capacity.
 b. Grout Injecting Equipment. Provide pumping equipment capable of continuous operation
 with little variation of pressure that includes a system for circulating the grout when actual
 grouting is not in progress.
 Use positive displacement type grout pumps that provide a continuous flow of grout and
 will be able to maintain a discharge pressure of at least 145 psi. Use grout pumps with
 adequate capacity so that an optimal rate of grouting can be achieved. Ensure pumps are
 constructed to have seals adequate to prevent oil, air or other foreign substances
 entering the grout and to prevent loss of grout or water.
 Use equipment capable of maintaining pressure on completely grouted ducts and fitted
 with a valve that can be closed off without loss of pressure in the duct.
 Install a pressure gauge having a full-scale reading of no more than 290 psi at the duct
 inlet. If hoses in excess of 100 feet total length are used, place and use two gauges, one
 at the pump and one at the inlet.
 Use grout hoses with sufficient diameter, rated pressure capacity and that are compatible
 with the pump output. Install a sampling tee with stopcock that minimizes the number of
 bends, valves, and changes in diameter. Firmly connect grout hoses to pump outlets,
 pipes, and duct inlets.
 Do not use compressed air to aid the pumping of grout.
 c.
 
 Air Compression. Provide equipment to supply oil-free and water-free compressed air to
 blow out excess water and to check the free passage of the ducts.
 
 191
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 d. Flushing Equipment. Provide standby flushing equipment using a potable water supply to
 facilitate complete removal of grout from the duct if difficult grouting conditions exist. This
 equipment is in addition to the grouting equipment. Utilize a different power source than
 the grouting equipment. Furnish equipment that is capable of delivering a pressure of at
 least 290 psi to flush out partially grouted enclosures.
 e. Vacuum Grouting Equipment. Use volumetric measuring type vacuum grouting
 equipment with the ability to measure a void and supply a measured volume of grout to
 fill the void.
 f.
 
 Standby Equipment. During grouting operations, provide a standby grout mixer and
 pump.
 
 9. Mixing of Grout. Mix grout using the entire contents of each bag in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations and using a metered amount of water. Mix the materials
 thoroughly to produce a homogeneous grout without excessive temperature increase or loss
 of properties. Do not mix grout longer than the manufacturer’s recommended duration.
 Continuously agitate the grout until grouting is complete.
 Check the fluidity of the grout in accordance with Subsection 701-2.08. Do not commence
 grout pumping until fluidity requirements are satisfied.
 Do not add water to increase fluidity that has decreased by delayed use of the grout.
 10. Injection of Grout. Use a method of injecting grout that will ensure complete filling of the ducts
 and complete encasement of the prestressing steel.
 Open grout vents before commencing grouting operations, unless otherwise approved by the
 Engineer.
 Perform grouting in one operation, maintaining a continuous, one-way flow of grout. Grout
 tendons from the lowest vent in an uphill direction. Unless approved otherwise by the
 Engineer, pump grout at a rate of 15 feet to 50 feet of duct per minute to avoid air
 entrapment, segregation of the grout, and to ensure complete filling of the duct. Conduct
 normal grouting operations at a pressure range of 10 psi to 75 psi measured at the grout
 inlet. Do not exceed the maximum pumping pressure of 145 psi at the grout inlet.
 Pump grout through the duct and continuously discharge grout from the first and subsequent
 outlets until residual water and entrapped air have been removed and the consistency of the
 grout is equivalent to that of the grout being pumped into the inlet. Discharge at least 1/2
 gallon of grout from each outlet prior to closing the vent. Close all outlet vents in a similar
 manner one after another in the direction of flow except that at intermediate crests, close
 outlet vents placed a short distance downstream of the crest before closing their associated
 high point vent. Discarded grout does not represent additional cost to the Department.
 Pump grout through the duct and continuously discharge grout, to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer, at the anchorage and grout cap outlets until all free water and air are discharged
 and the consistency of the grout is equivalent to that of the grout being pumped into the inlet.
 Close the anchorage outlet vent and discharge a minimum of 1/2 gallon of grout from the
 grout cap. Close the grout cap outlet.
 After the outlets have been bled and sealed, bleed the grout pressure to 5 psi and wait a
 minimum of ten minutes for entrapped air to flow to the high points. After ten minutes,
 increase the pressure as needed and discharge grout at each high point outlet to eliminate all
 entrapped air or water. Complete the process by locking a pressure of 30 psi into the tendon
 prior to closing the inlet vent.
 
 192
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 502
 
 If the actual grouting pressure exceeds the maximum allowed, close the inlet vent and pump
 grout at the next outlet, which has just been or is ready to be closed, as long as one-way flow
 is maintained. Do not pump grout into a succeeding outlet vent from which grout has not yet
 flowed. If this procedure is used, equip the new inlet vent with a positive shut-off and
 pressure gage.
 11. Temperature Considerations. Do not grout if the ambient air temperature exceeds 100°F. Do
 not grout if the ambient air temperature is expected to be less than 40°F within 48 hours.
 Ensure grout temperature upon mixing is between 50°F and 90°F.
 If the ambient air temperature is below 32°F, keep ducts free of water to avoid damage due to
 freezing. Do not warm ducts with steam. Blow dry air (60 percent humidity or less) through
 the ducts to extract trapped water. Ensure ducts are free of frost and ice before commencing
 grouting operations.
 12. Post-Grouting Inspection. Do not remove or open vents until the grout has cured for at least
 24 hours. After the grout has cured, remove outlets and grout caps located at anchorages
 and high points along the tendon to facilitate inspection. If voids are suspected or if duct
 grouting operations were prematurely terminated prior to completely filling the duct, explore
 the voided area inside the duct with an endoscope, borescope, videoscope, or other visual
 means approved by the Engineer. Probing is not allowed. Determine the location and extent
 of all voided areas.
 Depending on the location of the void, drilling may be required to penetrate the inner surface
 of the anchorage or duct. Use drilling equipment that will automatically shut-off when steel is
 encountered.
 13. Repairing and Filling Voids. Repair and fill voids that occur in the ducts after the grouting
 operation is complete. If voids are found, submit a grouting repair plan for review and
 approval that describes the location and extent of the void and the method of repairing and
 filling the void. If the extent and location of the void is such that complete filling of the void is
 not possible using the grout injection equipment, repair and fill the void using a volumetric
 measuring vacuum grouting process utilizing the vacuum grouting equipment specified in
 Subsection 502-3.05.8.
 14. Finishing. Remove valves, caps and pipes for each vent to a depth at least 1 inch below the
 surface of the concrete. Fill the void left by the vent pipe according to Subsection 501-3.07.1.
 Do not remove or open vents until the grout as set for at least 24 hours.
 15. Protection of End Anchorages. Within 7 days upon completion of the grouting, permanently
 protect the anchorage of post-tensioning tendons to prevent access of water or other
 aggressive agents.
 Immediately before casting the concrete pour-backs (within 24 hours), mechanically clean
 and roughen the mating concrete surfaces to remove any laitance and to expose small
 aggregate. Use abrasive blast cleaning or water blasting with a pressure washer capable of
 at least 10,000 psi nozzle pressure at all elevations to clean the concrete surfaces. Keep the
 nozzle tip no more than 12 inches from the surface during all phases of water blasting. Flush
 the surface with water and blow dry. Ensure surfaces are clean, sound and without standing
 water.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract documents or shown on the approved shop
 drawings, ensure the prestressing steel and all parts of the anchoring assemblies are at least
 3 inches inside of the end surface of the member. Apply an epoxy bonding agent to the
 concrete mating surfaces according the manufacturer's instructions. Fill the recess with
 concrete and finish the concrete surface to true lines according to the Contract requirements.

 than 2.5 inches, at the free end of the bar.
 (2) Std 90° Hook: 90° bend plus a 12.0 nominal bar diameter extension at the free end of
 the bar.
 2. Bar Repairs. The Engineer will evaluate improperly bent bars and bars bent at locations not
 required by the Plans for structural adequacy and durability. Do not repair improperly bent
 bars until the bars are inspected by the Engineer and the Engineer approves repairing the
 bar. Bars repaired prior to inspection by the Engineer may be rejected. If, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, the bend is of such extent or character as to affect the strength or durability of the
 bar, the Engineer may reject the bar. Otherwise, the bar may be re-bent or straightened by
 means meeting the requirements of this Section and in a manner that will not damage the
 material, coating, or concrete.
 If the Engineer approves repairing the bar, preheat the reinforcing steel before bending.
 Apply heat by any method that does not damage the reinforcing steel or concrete. Preheat
 the reinforcing steel at least 5.0 nominal bar diameters in each direction from the center of
 the bend but do not extend preheating below the surface of the concrete. Insulate concrete
 within 6 inches of the heated bar area. Do not allow the temperature of the reinforcing steel at
 the concrete interface to exceed 500°F. Preheat the reinforcing steel to at least 1100°F.
 
 197
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 503
 
 Ensure the maximum reinforcing steel temperature never exceeds 1200°F. Maintain a
 uniform temperature throughout the thickness of the bar by using at least 2 heat tips
 simultaneously at opposite sides of bars larger than No. 6. Maintain the preheat temperature
 of the reinforcing steel until bending or straightening is complete. Make the bend gradually
 with smooth continuous application of force. When straightening, move a bender
 progressively around the bend. When bending or straightening is complete, gradually reduce
 the temperature of the reinforcing steel to the ambient air temperature. Do not artificially cool
 the bars with water, forced air, or any other means.
 503-3.04 PLACING AND FASTENING. Place reinforcing steel in the position as shown on the
 Plans. Secure the reinforcing steel to prevent movement during concrete placement. Do not
 place bars in addition to those shown on the Plans without prior approval of the Engineer. Do not
 place bars of different size, material, or grade without prior approval of the Engineer. Space
 reinforcing steel evenly unless noted otherwise. Provide 2 inches of concrete clear cover,
 measured from the surface of the reinforcing steel to the outside surface of the concrete, unless
 noted otherwise.
 Do not place bars on layers of fresh concrete or adjust bars while placing concrete.
 1. Fastening Requirements. Tie the bars with No. 14 or No.16 gauge steel wire. When the
 spacing between bars is 1 foot or more, tie the bars at all intersections. When the bar spacing
 is less than 1 foot, tie every other intersection. If the Plans require bundled bars, tie bundled
 bars together at not more than 6-foot centers. Tie all intersections of epoxy-coated reinforcing
 steel in the top mat of concrete decks and approach slabs. Use wire coated with plastic,
 epoxy, or similar non-conductive material when tying epoxy-coated reinforcing steel. Obtain
 the Engineer’s written authorization before welding reinforcing steel. Provide at least 1 inch
 clear cover to the tie wire by turning the tie wire away from concrete surfaces.
 For slip-formed concrete, tie reinforcing steel at all intersections. Provide additional
 reinforcing steel cross bracing to keep the cage from moving during concrete placement.
 Place cross bracing both longitudinally and transversely.
 2. Bar Supports. Maintain distances from the forms using approved precast mortar blocks, metal
 supports, or plastic supports strong enough to resist permanent movement under
 construction loads. If supports extend to exposed concrete surfaces, use metal or plastic
 supports. To support and fasten epoxy-coated reinforcing steel, use plastic supports or metal
 supports coated with plastic, epoxy, or similar non-conductive material. Do not use wooden or
 aluminum supports.
 Place supports at frequent intervals to maintain the cover between the reinforcing and the
 surface of the concrete. Space supports under concrete deck reinforcing steel and approach
 slab reinforcing steel not more than 4 feet apart in each direction.
 503-3.05 SPLICING. Splice reinforcing steel bars at locations shown on the Plans and specified
 in this Section. Obtain the written approval of the Engineer before splicing bars at other locations.
 The Engineer will evaluate splices at locations not designated in the Contract documents for
 structural adequacy.
 Splice reinforcing steel bars using lap splicing, welded butt joints, electric resistance butt welded
 joints, welded lap splicing, mechanical butt splicing, or mechanical lap splicing, unless noted
 otherwise. Do not splice reinforcing steel bars at locations where splices in the reinforcing steel
 are not allowed.
 Splices will not be permitted in bars 40 feet or less in plan length, unless otherwise noted in the
 Contract documents. For bars exceeding 40 feet in plan length, ensure the distance center-tocenter of splices is not less than 30 feet, with no individual bar length less than 10 feet. Stagger
 
 198
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 503
 
 splices in adjacent bars, unless otherwise noted. Stagger lap splices a distance greater than the
 lapped splice length. Stagger butt splices at least 2 feet.
 Reinforcing steel may be continuous at locations where splices are noted in the Contract
 documents.
 Do not use lap splicing for No. 14 or No. 18 bars.
 Do not lap splice spiral reinforcing steel. Anchor each end unit of reinforcing steel spiral by
 lapping the free end of the spiral to the continuous spiral and using either a welded lap splice or a
 mechanical lap splice.
 Do not field weld epoxy-coated reinforcing steel bars.
 1. Lap Splicing.
 a. General. Place reinforcing steel bars in contact and securely tie the bars together.
 Provide a minimum clear distance of 2 inches between the spliced bars and the nearest

 Test each sample according to ASTM A370, including Appendix A9. Tensile test each
 sample until partial or total fracture of the parent bar material, mechanical splice material,
 or bar-to-splice connection.
 All splices in the lot represented by a test will be considered to meet the tensile strength
 requirements when the minimum individual tensile strength of the sampled splices is not
 less than 80000 psi, based on the nominal bar area.
 5. Mechanical Lap Splices.
 a. General. Conform to the manufacturer's instructions when splicing.
 Provide a clear cover of not less than 1-1/2 inches measured from the surface of the
 concrete to the outside of the splice sleeve. Adjust stirrups, ties and other reinforcing
 steel if necessary to provide clear cover.
 For epoxy-coated bars, use epoxy-coated mechanical splices.
 Mark each splice with the lot, heat, or batch number that identifies the splice.
 b. Qualifications. A splice will be considered qualified if the splice can develop a minimum
 tensile strength of 75000 psi, based on the nominal bar area, when tested according to
 ASTM A370, including Appendix A9.
 Submit the following information:
 (1) the manufacturer's name;
 (2) the name of the product or assembly;
 (3) the lot, heat, or batch number that identifies the splice;
 (4) the bar grade and size number to be spliced by the material;
 (5) a complete description of the splice and installation procedure; and,
 (6) test results indicating the splice, used according to the manufacturer's procedures,
 complies with the minimum tensile strength requirements.
 c.
 
 Testing/Inspection. Perform job control tests consisting of the fabrication, under
 conditions used to produce the splice, and tensile testing of 6 sample splices for each lot
 of splices. The Engineer will designate when samples for job control tests are to be
 fabricated and will determine the limits of the lot represented by each job control test.
 A lot of mechanical butt joints is defined as no more than 150 splices of the same type of
 mechanical butt splice used for each combination of bar size and bar deformation pattern
 that is used in the work.
 Make splice samples using the same splice materials, position, equipment, and following
 the same procedures as used to make splices in the work. Make splice samples at least
 5 feet long with the splice at mid-length. Shorter sample splice bars may be used if
 approved by the Engineer.

 SECTION 503
 
 Perform job control tests in the presence of the Engineer. Splices tested in the absence
 of the Engineer may be rejected. Notify the Engineer, in writing, at least 7 working days
 prior to performing testing.
 Identify sample splices with weatherproof markings prior to shipment to the testing
 laboratory.
 Test each sample according to ASTM A370, including Appendix A9. Tensile test each
 sample until partial or total fracture of the parent bar material, mechanical splice material,
 or bar-to-splice connection.
 All splices in the lot represented by a test will be considered to meet the tensile strength
 requirements when the minimum individual tensile strength of the sampled splices is not
 less than 75000 psi, based on the nominal bar area.
 503-3.06 HEADED BAR REINFORCING STEEL. Use headed bar reinforcing steel consisting of
 deformed reinforcing steel bars with a head attached to one or both ends. Attachment can be
 accomplished through welding or forging of heads onto the bar ends, by internal threads in the
 head mating to threads on the bar end or by a separate threaded nut to secure the head to the
 bar. Heads may be forge formed, machined from bar stock, or cut from plate.
 Perform production control tests consisting of the installation, using the same procedure as used
 in the work, and tensile testing of 3 sample splices for each lot of heads.
 A production lot of headed bar reinforcing steel is defined as no more than 150 splices of the
 same bar size, with heads of the same size and type, and manufactured by the same method,
 produced from bar material of a single heat number and head material of a single heat number.
 For bars having heads on both ends, the bar will be counted as 2 reinforcing steel bars for the
 purposes of establishing and testing production lots.
 Test each sample according to ASTM A970.
 All splices in the lot represented by a test will be considered to meet the tensile strength
 requirements when the minimum individual tensile strength of the sampled splices meets the
 tensile strength requirements of ASTM A970.
 503-3.07 DRILLING AND BONDING DOWELS. Install dowels at locations shown on the Plans or
 as authorized by the Engineer. Drill holes by methods that do not shatter or damage the concrete
 adjacent to the holes. Do not damage reinforcing steel or prestressing steel when drilling through
 reinforced concrete members, unless approved by the Engineer. The Engineer will evaluate holes
 in which reinforcing steel or prestressing steel is encountered during drilling for structural
 adequacy and durability.
 Drill each hole to the diameter and depth recommended by the manufacturer to develop the
 ultimate strength of the dowel or to the depth shown on the Plans, whichever is greater.

 Face and bring to an even bearing abutting joints in compression members and girder
 flanges, and in tension members where specified on the drawings. Where joints are not
 faced, keep the opening at 1/4 inch or less.
 Build floor beams, stringers, and girders with end construction angles to the exact length
 shown on the Plans, as measured between the heels of the connection angles. The
 permissible tolerance is plus 0 inch to minus 1/16 inch. Where continuity is required, face end
 connections.
 Cold bend load-carrying rolled-steel plates as follows:
 Take the rolled-steel plates from the stock plates so that the bend line is at right angles to
 the direction of rolling. Before bending, round the edges of the plate to a radius of 1/16
 inch throughout the portion of the plate to be bent.
 Bend until the radius of the bends, measured to the concave face of the metal, is not
 less, and preferably more, than shown in the following table, where T is the thickness of
 the plate.

 If a shorter radius is essential, bend the plates when hot, but not shorter than a radius of
 1.0 T.
 Fit up and attach end and intermediate stiffeners as shown on the Plans. Do not weld ends of
 stiffeners and other attachments to flanges unless shown on the Plans.
 Submit shop drawings in one complete submittal package. Partial or incomplete submittals
 will not be reviewed or considered. Partial or incomplete submittals will be rejected. No
 additional contract time will be permitted due to partial, incomplete, or inadequate submittals.
 3. Shop Splices. In addition to those shown on the Plans, girder webs and flanges may contain
 a maximum of 2 shop splices per plate per span. Indicate all splices on the shop drawings.
 These splices are subject to approval and are subject to the following limitations:
 Make splices complete penetration butt welds. Grind flange splices flush. Grind web splices
 flush on the outside face of exterior girders only. Grind parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
 girder.
 Do not place a bottom flange splice within the middle third of any span. Use tension flange
 splices only as shown on the Plans or as approved.
 Completely weld each element of a girder, such as flange or web, before attaching it to
 another element.
 
 207
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 504
 
 Make all splices at least 6 inches from the nearest stiffener plate. Offset web and flange
 splices at least 6 inches.
 4. Bolt Holes. Either drill or punch bolt holes. Make finished bolt holes 1/16 inch larger than the
 nominal diameter of the bolt. Ensure holes are clean cut and without burrs or ragged edges.
 Material with poorly matched holes will be rejected.
 When material forming parts of a member is composed of not more than 5 thicknesses of
 metal, and whenever the thickness of the metal is not greater than 3/4 inch for structural
 carbon steel or 5/8 inch for alloy steel, either punch or drill the holes to full size.
 When there are more than 5 thicknesses or when any of the main material is thicker than 3/4
 inch in carbon steel, or 5/8 inch in alloy steel, or when required under paragraph 7 below,
 subpunch or subdrill the holes 3/16 inch smaller. After assembling, ream them to size or drill
 them from the solid to full size.
 For punched holes, the diameter of the die must not exceed the diameter of the punch by
 more than 1/16 inch. Ream any holes that must be enlarged to admit bolts.
 Ream holes cylindrical and perpendicular to the member. Direct reamers mechanically,
 where practicable.
 Ream and drill using twist drills. Assemble connecting parts requiring reamed or drilled holes
 and securely hold them while reaming or drilling them. Match mark them before
 disassembling.
 Subpunch (or subdrill if required) holes for field connections and field splices of arch
 members, continuous beams, towers (each face), bents, plate girders, and rigid frames while
 assembled in the shop. Obtain approval of the assembly, including camber, alignment, and
 accuracy of holes and milled joints before beginning reaming.
 Subpunch and ream holes for floor beam and stringer field end connections to a steel
 template, or ream them while assembled. When partial assembly is permitted ream holes for
 web member connections with steel templates.
 When using templates to ream field connections of web members of an arch, bent or tower,
 mill or scribe at least one end of each web member normal to the long axis of the member.
 Accurately set the templates at both ends from this milled or scribed end.
 Ream or drill the full size of the field connection through templates after carefully locating the
 templates as to position and angle and firmly bolting them. Use exact duplicate templates
 used to ream matching members or the opposite faces of one member. Accurately locate
 templates for connections that duplicate so that like members are duplicates and require no
 matchmarking.
 Accurately punch holes full-size, subpunch them, or subdrill them so that after assembling
 (before reaming), a cylindrical pin 1/8 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the
 punched hole may be entered perpendicular to the face of the member, without drifting, in at
 least 75 percent of the contiguous holes in the same plane. If the requirement is not fulfilled,
 the badly punched pieces will be rejected. If any hole will not pass a pin 3/16 inch smaller in
 diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole, the material will be rejected.
 Ream or drill holes so that 85 percent of the holes in any contiguous group after being
 reamed or drilled show no offset greater than 1/32 inch between adjacent thicknesses of
 metal.
 
 208
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 504
 
 Provide in steel templates hardened steel bushings in holes accurately dimensioned from the
 center lines of the connection as inscribed on the template. Use the center lines to locate
 accurately the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 5. Shop Assembling. Completely shop assemble the entire structure, including the floor system.
 When the Contract Documents indicate “partial assembly,” assemble continuous beams and
 plate girders in lengths of 3 or more abutting panels. The assembled length must be at least
 150 feet.
 Clean metal surfaces in contact before assembling them. Assemble, pin well, and firmly draw
 together the parts of a member with bolts before beginning reaming. Make milled ends of
 compression members in full bearing before starting reaming. Take apart assembled pieces,
 if necessary, to remove burrs and shavings produced by reaming. Keep the members free of
 twists, bends, and other deformities.
 To prepare to shop bolt material punched full-size, spear-ream the bolt holes, if necessary, to
 admit the bolts. Make the reamed holes no more than 1/16 inch larger than the nominal
 diameter of the bolts.
 Secure end connection angles, stiffeners, and similar parts using shipping bolts to prevent
 damage in shipment and handling.
 Furnish a camber diagram showing the camber at each panel for each truss. Take the
 camber from actual measurement while the truss is assembled, or base it on calculated
 values when full assembly is not required.
 Allow holes to drift during assembly only as needed to position the parts, and not enough to
 enlarge the holes or distort the metal. To enlarge holes to admit the bolts, ream them.
 Match mark connecting parts assembled in the shop to allow for reaming holes in field
 connections. Furnish a diagram showing the marks.
 6. Bolted Connections, High-Strength Bolts. Determine bolt lengths by adding the values given
 in Table 504-1 to the total thickness of connected material. These values compensate for
 thickness of nut, bolt point, and washers. Add 5/32 inch to the grip length per each additional
 flat washer. Adjust the total length to the next longer 1/4 inch increment up to a 5 inch length
 and to the next longer 1/2 inch increment for lengths over 5 inches.
 Fit bolted parts solidly together when assembling them and do not separate them by gaskets
 or other interposed compressible material. Place hardened washers under the turned
 element.

 Keep assembled joint surfaces, including those adjacent to washers, free of scale except
 tight mill scale. Clean off dirt, loose rust, burrs, and other defects that would prevent the parts
 from seating. Keep contact surfaces free of oil, paint, or lacquer.
 When the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20, use a smooth beveled
 washer in contact with the sloped surface.
 Tighten fasteners to give at least the required minimum tension values shown in Table 504-2
 when the joint is completed. Use bolts and nuts made by the same manufacturer in a
 connection.

 Use zinc coated load indicating washers. Demonstrate the suitability of the device by testing
 a representative sample of at least three devices for each diameter and grade of fastener
 used in the structure. Test with a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension. Include
 in the test assembly flat, hardened washers, if required in the actual connection, arranged as
 those in the actual connection to be tensioned. Demonstrate with the calibration test that the
 device indicates a tension at least 5 percent greater than that required by Table 504-2. Follow
 manufacturer's installation procedures when installing bolts in the calibration device and in all
 connections. Be careful to properly install flat, hardened washers when using load indicating
 devices with bolts installed in oversized or slotted holes and when using the load indicating
 devices under the turned element. The load indicating device will count as one washer for the
 purpose of determining bolt length.
 Place the load indicating device under the bolt head and turn only the nut when tightening the
 bolt. The device must indicate full tensioning of the bolt when the opening reaches zero.
 Install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition. Then,
 tighten fasteners, progressing systematically from the most rigid part (usually near the center)
 of the connection to the free edges, or as directed. Keep previously tightened fasteners from
 relaxing. Multiple systematic tightening cycles may be required.
 Do not reuse high-strength bolts. Remove previously fully tightened bolts that were loosened
 by tightening adjacent bolts. Replace them with new bolts, nuts, and load indicating devices.
 7. Welding. Perform all welding and Nondestructive Examination (NDE) as specified or shown
 on the Plans. Conform to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code D1.5 when welding
 new steel bridge girders, beams, and stringers. Conform to the Structural Welding Code
 AWS D1.1 when welding all other steel structures.

 Partial or incomplete submittals will not be reviewed or considered. Partial or incomplete
 submittals will be rejected. No additional contract time will be permitted due to partial,
 incomplete, or inadequate submittals.
 Do not deviate from the approved erection plan without the written permission of the
 Engineer.
 5. Assembling Steel. Accurately assemble the parts as shown on the Plans and follow matchmarks. Handle the material carefully to avoid bending, breaking, or otherwise damaging the
 parts. Do not hammer if doing so will injure or distort the members. Clean bearing surfaces
 and surfaces to be in permanent contact before assembling the members.
 6. Attachment of Formwork. When approved, use 1-inch maximum diameter holes in steel
 girder webs for attaching formwork. Place holes 6 inches minimum clear distance from all
 horizontal or vertical welds and space them at least 4 feet center to center. Drill or subpunch
 and ream holes. Do not provide empty bolt holes. Fill empty holes with tensioned highstrength bolts.
 Include in the request enough detail of the formwork for determining the stresses that will be
 imposed on the girder.
 504-3.03 PAINTING.
 1. Preparing Metal Surfaces for Painting. Prepare metal surfaces according to Specification
 SSPC-SP 10, Near White Blast Cleaning to a profile depth of 1 to 3 mils. Use a profile
 comparator to ensure minimum profile depth. Do not reuse sand or flint abrasives.
 Clean grit or shot of contamination before reusing it. Blow dust and grit from the surface with
 clean dry air. Remove weld spatter and round sharp edges to a smooth curve. To remove
 contamination, jet wash or scrub with a stiff brush and clear water or brush blast. Remove
 light rust with a steel brush or mechanical tool.
 2. Schedule of Paint Coats for Metals. Unless otherwise specified, if structural steel will be
 exposed to weathering, shop-paint it at least 3 coats: prime coat, intermediate coat, and finish
 coat.
 3. Painting Metal Surfaces.
 a. Time of Application. Apply 1 or more applications of prime coat. Apply the initial
 application within 4 hours after blast cleaning. Allow the manufacturer’s recommended
 drying time between primer applications. Before painting and after preparing the surface,
 remove any oil, grease, soil, dust, or foreign matter on the surface. If rusting occurs after
 the surface is prepared, clean the surface again.
 Avoid contaminating cleaned surfaces with salts, acids, alkali, or other corrosive
 chemicals before applying the prime coat and between applications of the remaining
 coats of paint. Remove any contamination from the surface.
 
 212
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 504
 
 b. Storage of Paint and Thinner. Store paint and thinner in a separate building or in a room
 that is well ventilated and free from excessive heat, sparks, flame, or direct sun rays.
 Keep paints susceptible to damage from freezing in a heated storage space when
 necessary.
 Leave paint containers unopened until required for use. Use open containers first. Seal
 left-over, partial containers.
 Do not use paint that has begun to polymerize, solidify, gel, or deteriorate.
 c.
 
 Mixing and Thinning. Mix paint thoroughly before use and agitate often during application.
 Do not transfer paint mixed in the original container until all settled pigment is
 incorporated into the vehicle. Pouring off part of the vehicle temporarily to simplify mixing,
 is permitted.
 Mix by mechanical methods, except use hand mixing for containers up to 5 gallons.
 Do not use an air stream bubbling under the paint surface to mix paint or keep it in
 suspension. Remove and discard any skin that has formed in the container. Do not use
 the paint if the skin exceeds 2 percent of the paint volume.
 When mixing paint, break up all lumps, completely disperse settled pigment, and create a
 uniform composition. If mixing by hand, pour off most of the vehicle into a clean
 container.
 Lift the pigment in the paint from the bottom of the container using a broad, flat paddle.
 Break up lumps and thoroughly mix the pigment with the vehicle. Return the poured-off
 vehicle to the paint by simultaneously stirring or pouring repeatedly from one container to
 another until the composition is uniform. Inspect the bottom of the container for unmixed
 pigment.
 Wet tinting pastes or colors with a small amount of thinner, vehicle, or paint and
 thoroughly mix them. Add the thinned mixture to the large container of paint and mix until
 the color is uniform.
 If paint does not have a limited pot life, or does not deteriorate on standing, mix it at any
 time before use. However, if it has settled, remix it immediately before use. Do not keep
 paint in spray pots, painters' buckets, etc., overnight. Gather it into a container and remix
 it before use.
 When the engineer deems it necessary to obtain satisfactory application, add paint
 thinner according to the manufacturer's instructions.
 
 d. Application of Paint. Use the oldest of each kind of paint first. Apply paint by spraying.
 Use brushes, daubers, or sheepskins when no other method can properly apply paint in
 difficult access areas. Use dipping, roller coating, or flow coating only when authorized.
 Blast clean all areas with mudcracking in the zinc-rich primer and then paint them with
 primer to the specified thickness.
 After applying the prime coat, apply the intermediate and finish coats to exposed surfaces
 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
 Apply the intermediate coat in 2 applications. Apply the first application as a mist coat.
 Apply the second application after the mist coat has dried to a set-to-touch condition.
 
 213
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 504
 
 Apply the finish coat in 1 application.
 Apply paint within the environmental limitations specified by the coating manufacturer. Do
 not apply paint when the temperature of the steel surface is less than 40 °F or more than
 125 °F.
 Do not apply paint in fog or mist, when it is raining or snowing, or when the relative
 humidity exceeds the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not apply paint to wet or
 damp surfaces. Do not apply paint on frosted or ice-coated surfaces.
 With approval, apply paint in damp or cold weather, and only under the following
 conditions. Paint the steel under cover and protect and shelter it, or heat the surrounding
 air and the steel to a satisfactory temperature. Meet the above temperature and humidity
 conditions. Keep the steel under cover or protected until it is dry or until weather
 conditions permit its exposure.
 Allow to dry any applied paint exposed to freezing, excess humidity, rain, snow, or
 condensation. Then, remove damaged areas of paint, prepare the surface again, and
 repaint it with the same kind as the undamaged areas.
 Stripe paint before applying each coat of paint. Spot paint edges, corners, crevices,
 rivets, bolts, welds, and sharp edges before applying the full coat of paint on the steel.
 Extend striping for at least 1 inch from the edge. Let this stripe coat dry before applying
 the full coat, if possible. Otherwise, set-to-touch the stripe coat before applying the full
 coat. However, do not permit the stripe coat to dry long enough to allow the unprimed
 steel to rust.
 Apply each coat of paint as a continuous film of uniform thickness, free of pores. Repaint
 any thin spots or areas missed in the application. Allow them to dry before applying the
 next coat.
 Wait until each coat of paint is in the proper state of cure or dryness before applying the
 next coat.
 Ensure a minimum dry film thickness of 3 mils and a maximum dry film thickness of 5
 mils for each coat of paint. The dry film thickness of the paint will be measured in place
 with a calibrated magnetic film thickness gauge. If any coat of paint is thinner than
 specified, obtain the minimum dry film thickness by applying additional coats of paint.
 A Tooke gauge may be used to perform destructive testing of each coat’s dry film
 thickness. Repair damaged areas.
 e. Brush Application. Brush paint areas inaccessible to a spray gun. Work paint into
 crevices and corners. Paint surfaces not accessible to brushes using daubers or
 sheepskins. Brush out runs or sags. Leave a minimum of brush marks in the applied
 paint.
 f.
 
 Spray Application of Paint. To apply paint by spraying, use equipment capable of properly
 atomizing the paint to be applied. Use equipment with pressure regulators and gauges
 and use air caps, nozzles, and needles recommended by the equipment manufacturer for
 the material being sprayed. Keep the equipment in satisfactory condition to permit proper
 paint application. In closed or recirculating paint spray systems, where gas is used under
 pressure over the liquid, use an inert gas, such as nitrogen.
 Provide adequately sized traps or separators to remove oil and water from the
 compressed air. Drain them periodically during operations. Ensure that the air from the
 spray gun impinging against the surface shows no water or oil.
 
 214
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 504
 
 Keep paint ingredients properly mixed in the spray pots or containers while applying the
 paint. Use either continuous mechanical agitation or frequent intermittent agitation.
 Adjust the pressure on the material in the pot and adjust the air pressure at the gun for
 optimum spraying effectiveness. Adjust the pressure on the material in the pot when
 changing the elevation of the gun above the pot. Keep the atomizing air pressure at the
 gun high enough to atomize the paint properly but not so high as to cause the paint to fog
 or the solvent to evaporate, or to cause loss by overspray.
 Keep spray equipment clean to avoid depositing dirt, dried paint, and other foreign
 materials in the paint film. Remove any solvents left in the equipment before applying
 paint to the surface.
 Apply paint in a uniform layer, overlapping at the edge of the spray pattern. During
 application, hold the gun perpendicular to the surface and at a distance that will deposit a
 wet layer of paint on the surface. Release the gun’s trigger at the end of each stroke.
 Apply coats free of runs, sags, and dry spray.
 g. Shop Painting. Perform shop painting after fabrication and before the surface is damaged
 from weather or other exposure.
 Do not paint shop contact surfaces. Paint surfaces to be in contact after field erection.
 Apply only a mist coat (0.5 to 0.8 mil dry film thickness) of inorganic zinc-rich primer,
 meeting SSPC Paint Specification No. 30, Weld-Through Inorganic Zinc Primer, Class 5,
 on the following surfaces:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 High strength bolted connection contact surfaces
 Top flange steel surfaces
 Areas within 2 inches from the edges to be welded
 Areas where the full 3 coats of paint will interfere with field assembly
 
 Apply the full paint coats specified to steel surfaces that will contact wood.
 Remove anti-weld spatter coatings before painting.
 Before abrasive blasting, grind smooth all metal defects, fins, slivers, burrs, weld spatter,
 and sharp edges from shearing or similar operations, including flame hardened edges
 from cutting or burning. Grind flame hardened edges to a 1/16 inch minimum radius.
 Repair defects that become evident after abrasive blasting or prime coat application.
 Retexture the surface to match the blasted profile.
 Copy erection marks and weight marks on areas that have been previously painted with
 the shop coat.
 h. Field Painting. If steel surfaces have not received the full paint coats, paint them as soon
 as possible after erection.
 Touch up metal that has been shop coated with the same type of paint as the shop coat.
 Touch up by cleaning and painting field connections, welds, bolts and all damaged or
 defective paint and rusted areas.
 If concreting or other operations damage any paint, clean the surface and repaint it.
 Remove concrete spatter and drippings before applying paint.
 Protect wet paint against damage from dust or other detrimental foreign matter.

 i.
 
 Drying of Painted Metal. Allow the paint to dry before recoating or exposing it. Do not add
 a dryer to paint on the job unless the paint specification calls for one. Do not immerse
 painted metal until the paint has dried. Protect paint from rain, condensation,
 contamination, snow, and freezing until dry.
 
 j.
 
 Handling of Painted Steel. Do not handle painted steel until the paint has dried except for
 turning it for painting or stacking it for drying. Minimize damage to paint films from
 stacking steel members.
 Remove paint that is damaged during handling and touch it up with the same number of
 coats and kinds of paint previously applied.
 Wait until painted steel is dry before loading it for shipment.
 Repair damaged galvanized coating per Subsection 716-2.07.
 
 k.
 
 System Durability and Certification. Have the coating manufacturer review the project and
 the proposed service environment and issue you written recommendations and
 instructions to properly prepare the surface, apply the coating, and achieve maximum
 durability on this project.
 Certify to the Department that the system was applied according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations and instructions. Enclose a copy of the recommendations and
 instructions with the certificate.
 
 504-3.04 CLEANUP. Upon completion and before final acceptance of the structure, remove
 falsework and falsework piling down to 2 feet below the finished ground line.

 CUT-OFF. The cut off end of a pile, or cutting a pile end at the finish elevation.
 DIFFICULT DRIVING. Difficult driving occurs when the actual driving resistance experienced
 exceeds expectations, demonstrated by the approved hammer exceeding 120 blows per foot,
 while operating at 80 percent efficiency or greater.
 DRIVECAP. A pile driver component that is used to transmit impact forces from the hammer ram
 to the pile top. The drivecap includes the anvil or striker plate, hammer cushion (capblock),
 helmet, and pile cushion, if used. (Also termed the driving head).
 DRIVING RESISTANCE. The required axial resistance, in units of force, to be achieved during
 pile installation.
 ESTIMATED PILE TIP ELEVATION. The elevation at which the Department expects the driving
 resistance to be achieved.
 FRESH HEADING. Cutting the end of a pile perpendicular to the long axis to remove damage,
 and to obtain a proper driving or splicing surface.
 FOLLOWER. A pile driving aid placed between the helmet and the pile top when the pile head is
 below the reach of the hammer.
 HAMMER CUSHION. A disk of material placed on top of the helmet but below the anvil or striker
 plate to relieve impact shock and provide protection for the hammer and pile.
 HAMMER ENERGY:
 Maximum Rated Hammer Energy. The theoretical maximum amount of gross energy that a
 pile driving hammer can generate.
 Transferred Hammer Energy. The amount of energy transferred to the pile for a given blow
 accounting for friction energy during the ram down stroke, energy retained in the ram and
 drivecap during rebound, and other impact losses.
 HELMET. A pile driver component that fits closely on top of the pile to ensure the impact force is
 transmitted uniformly across the top of the pile and concentric with the axis of the pile.
 LEADS. Pile driver components used to maintain pile and hammer alignment during driving, and
 on which the pile hammer may travel. Types of leads include:
 Fixed Leads. Pile driving leads that are attached at the top of the boom by a pivot and to the
 crane at the bottom with a brace. The pile is held at the top by the helmet and is guided at the
 bottom by the pile gate.
 Semi-Fixed Leads. Pile driving leads that are attached at the top of the boom by a pivot and
 supported by the lead line. The lead can slide axially along the pivoted boom point and may
 be fitted with an extendable brace at the bottom of the leads.

 refusal or impedes the pile's advance within required tolerances.
 PILE GATE. A device at the base of the leads that is closed around the pile to maintain
 alignment.
 REFUSAL. Refusal occurs when the approved hammer requires 15 or more blows to move the
 pile one inch while the hammer is operating at 80 percent efficiency or higher, or, when the pile
 yield stress is measured or calculated to be equal to or greater than 90 percent of the specified
 pile yield stress.

 loads directly from the superstructure to the ground.
 TEST PILE. A pile that has a high-strain dynamic test performed on it.
 TEMPLATE. A structure affixed to the ground used to maintain proper pile alignment during
 driving.
 WAVE EQUATION ANALYSIS. A numerical method of analysis for the behavior of driven piles
 that predicts the pile capacity versus blow count relationship (bearing graph) and pile driving
 stress. Wave equation analysis is performed using a commercially available wave equation
 analysis program (WEAP) with a version dated 2005 or later.
 505-2.01 MATERIALS. Use materials that conform to the following:
 Structural Steel Piles
 Sand
 
 Section 715
 Subsection 703-2.12
 
 505-2.02 PILES. Furnish piles sufficient in length to obtain the driving resistance and to extend to
 the estimated pile tip elevation specified in the Contract documents. Furnish full-length piles
 where practical. Where splices are required, follow the provisions of Subsection 505-3.04.
 Furnish additional pile length to provide for fresh heading and to suit the method of installation.

 them from damage.
 1. Steel Piles. Furnish H-pile sections, pipe piles, sheet piles or other structural steel sections
 described in the Contract.
 Do not furnish spirally welded pipe piles.
 The Engineer will reject steel piles that exceed the camber and sweep permitted by allowable
 mill tolerance.
 Hot-dip galvanize steel piles a minimum thickness of 4 mils from the top to a distance not less
 than 10 feet below the finished ground line according to Subsection 716-2.07. Steel piles and
 pile shells that do not protrude above the final ground line do not require galvanizing.
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 505-3.01 PILE DRIVING EQUIPMENT.
 1. Pile Driving System. Use impact hammers to drive piles and to determine resistance during
 pile driving. If a vibratory hammer is used, use an impact hammer to determine pile
 
 219
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 505
 
 resistance by driving the pile an additional penetration of at least 5 feet. Use pile driver leads
 that allow the hammer to move freely. Do not use followers to drive piles.
 Fit the pile driving hammer with a cast-steel driving head (or similar device) that is
 recommended in the hammer manufacturer’s guidelines, is compatible with the pile, and
 aligns concentrically and fits closely with the top of the pile.
 If the pile driving hammer is fitted with a hammer cushion, use a cushion that satisfies the
 recommendation in the hammer manufacturer’s guidelines, is appropriate to prevent damage
 to the hammer or pile, and ensures uniform driving performance. If not new, ensure the
 hammer cushion is at least 75 percent of the manufactured thickness. Replace driving
 hammer cushions with a reduction in cushion thickness exceeding 25 percent of the
 manufactured thickness. Do not use wood, wire rope, or asbestos hammer cushions.
 Use only equipment included in the approved pile driving plan. The Engineer may inspect the
 pile driving equipment for conformance with the approved pile driving plan after it has been
 mobilized to the site and prior to beginning pile driving operations. Remove and replace pile
 driving equipment the Engineer determines does not conform with the approved pile driving
 plan, at no extra cost to the Department and with no adjustment to contract time.
 2. Pile Driving Plan. No less than 30 days prior to the anticipated start of pile driving, submit for
 approval the details of each proposed pile driving system. Include in the pile driving plan:
 a. A completed Pile Driving Equipment Data form (Form 25D-098).
 b. Manufacturer’s catalog cuts, specifications, manuals, guidelines, and technical bulletins
 for all pile driving equipment to be used.
 c.
 
 A description of the techniques to be used for ensuring proper placement and alignment
 of the piles, obtaining the driving resistance, and advancing the piles to the estimated pile
 tip elevation.
 
 d. Alternate methods of pile installation in the event obstructions are encountered.
 e. A wave equation analysis for each pile driving system (see 505-3.01-3).
 The Engineer will base approval of the pile driving hammer on the wave equation analysis
 submitted by the Contractor and the requirements in this Subsection. The Department will
 verify the wave equation analysis using the computer program “GRLWEAP” and GRLWEAP
 industry standard hammer input data.
 The Engineer’s approval of the pile driving plan will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility
 for:
 f.
 
 removing and replacing piles damaged during pile driving operations,
 
 g. obtaining the driving resistance specified in the Contract, or
 h. meeting pile tip elevation specified in the Contract documents.
 Do not mobilize pile driving equipment to the site without an approved pile driving plan.
 Submit all revisions to the approved pile driving plan to the Engineer for approval. For all pile
 driving equipment not previously identified in the pile driving plan, include in the submittal all
 of the information required above for the pile driving plan. Explain to the Engineer, in writing,
 which portions of the approved pile driving plan will be superseded by the revision and which
 
 220
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 505
 
 portions remain unchanged. Allow at least 5 days for the Engineer’s approval of pile driving
 plan revisions.
 3. Wave Equation Analysis. Perform a wave equation analysis for all pile driving systems used
 to drive piling according to the requirements of this subsection and the user’s manual for the
 program. Verify that the pile driving system proposed does not produce pile stresses greater
 than 90-percent of the yield stress at the driving resistance specified in the plans. Also verify
 that the rate of pile penetration is 100-blows per foot or less at the driving resistance specified
 in the plans.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, or directed by the Engineer, use the following
 default values and the applicable values from Table 1 as input to the wave equation analysis
 program:

 505-3.02 PILE TESTING AND PILE DRIVING CRITERIA. The Engineer will use high-strain
 dynamic testing to set criteria to monitor pile driving performance and the resistance of the pile
 during driving. The Engineer may also perform pile testing to confirm hammer-system efficiency;
 pile driving stresses, and pile integrity. Attend a meeting with the Engineer at least 14 days prior
 to the beginning of pile driving operations to evaluate and discuss the test pile program. Give the
 Engineer 7 days advance notice before driving each test pile.
 The Engineer will perform the high-strain dynamic testing in accordance with ASTM D4945. Piles
 tested using high-strain dynamic testing may be incorporated into the work.
 The Engineer will test the first pile driven at each substructure. Do not drive any production piles
 at the substructure unit until the test pile has been driven to the driving resistance and minimum
 penetration specified in the Contract documents. The Engineer will require 4 hours at each test
 pile to set up and install the test equipment. The Engineer will attach testing instruments near the
 top of the test pile through drilled and threaded holes. When the pile is driven to the point where
 the testing instruments need to be removed from the lower pile section, they will be reattached to
 the top of the newly spliced section. The Department will furnish the testing equipment and labor
 necessary to mount the testing instruments to the pile. Provide a reasonable and safe means of
 access to the top of the test pile after the pile is placed in the leads. Furnish electrical power (a
 115 volt, 55-60 cycle AC outlet, 10 amp minimum) for the Engineer’s use during the installation
 and operation of the testing instruments.
 
 221
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 505
 
 Drive each test pile to the driving resistance and minimum penetration specified in the Contract
 documents as indicated by the driving criteria provided by the Engineer. The Engineer will record
 driving data for the test pile. If an obstruction is encountered during driving of the test pile, testing
 will stop on that pile and the next pile driven at the substructure unit will be designated as a test
 pile.
 If a pile is driven to estimated tip elevation and the driving data does not support the conclusion
 that the driving resistance has been obtained, the Engineer may direct testing of additional piles
 and or suspension of pile driving operations and require the Contractor to restrike the pile with the
 Engineer present to record driving data. Perform the restrike with a warmed-up hammer with the
 energy or fuel setting adjusted to the position indicated in the approved pile driving plan. Strike
 the test pile with 60 consecutive blows or until the pile penetrates an additional 3 inches,
 whichever comes first. The Engineer may terminate the re-strike at any point during the testing.
 If the results from the high-strain dynamic testing are acceptable to the Engineer, drive the
 remaining piles at the substructure unit using the driving criteria developed from the high-strain
 dynamic testing. The Engineer will provide the driving criteria within 1 day of the completion of
 high-strain dynamic testing. If the results from high-strain dynamic testing are not acceptable to
 the Engineer, proceed as per the written direction of the Engineer.
 Account for the entire allotted equipment installation time required by the Engineer in the
 progress schedule submitted under Subsection 108-1.03 or Section 646, as applicable.
 Suspension of pile driving operations at a testing location to allow for testing instrument
 installation or a re-strike of a test pile is not a suspension of work per Subsection 108-1.06 and
 additional contract time will not be allowed.
 505-3.03 DRIVING PILES. Drive all piles to the driving resistance and minimum penetration
 specified in the Contract documents using the pile driving criteria provided by the Engineer. Use
 the same pile driving system used to set pile driving criteria to drive all piles. Install piles in groups
 starting from the center of the group and proceed outward in either direction.
 If the pile is driven to the estimated pile tip elevation and does not achieve the driving resistance,
 continue driving the pile to a penetration established by the written direction of the Engineer.
 1. Driving Through New Embankment. When driving piles through new embankment and the
 depth of the embankment at the pile location is in excess of 5 feet, drive the pile in a hole
 made through the embankment. Make the hole diameter 6 inches greater than the pile. After
 driving the pile, fill the annular space around the pile with sand.
 2. Placement and Alignment. Ensure proper placement and alignment of the piles. The
 Engineer will reject piles that are bent or otherwise damaged by forcing the pile into the leads
 or template.
 Drive piles within an allowed variation as to direction of pile of not more than 1/4 inch per foot.
 Limit the rotation of steel piles about their longitudinal axis to 15 degrees from the plan
 position. In addition, position piles to the following tolerances:
 a. Abutments. Position the piles at the bottom of an abutment within 3 inches of the position
 specified in the Contract documents. Do not vary the distance between any two piles
 more than 3 inches from that specified in the Contract documents, and keep the clear
 distance from the edge of pile to the edge of footing to at least 9 inches.
 b. Pier Footings. Position the piles at the bottom of a footing within 6 inches of the position
 specified in the Contract documents. Do not vary the distance between any 2 piles more
 than 6 inches from that specified in the Contract documents, and keep the clear distance
 from the edge of pile to the edge of footing to at least 9 inches.
 
 222
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 505
 
 c.
 
 Exposed Pile Piers. Position the piles within 2 inches of the position specified in the
 Contract documents at cut-off elevation and within 3 inches of the position specified in
 the Contract documents at the original ground line elevation.
 
 3. Protection of New Concrete. When driving a pile near concrete placed within 28 days, ensure
 the distance between the pile being driven and the nearest edge of concrete is not less than
 the distance determined by the following formula:
 
 D=C E
 Where:
 
 D = Distance in feet
 E = Maximum rated hammer energy in foot-pounds
 C = Vibration coefficient shown in Table 505-2 based on the number of
 calendar days after concrete placement

 4. Obstructions. Use alternate methods to drive through or remove obstructions. Obtain written
 approval from the Engineer before employing any alternative methods of pile advancement.
 After exhausting all practicable means to obtain the minimum penetration, but without
 success, the Engineer will evaluate the structural adequacy of the bridge at a lesser
 penetration. This review will be based on the resistance of the pile during driving. If the
 Engineer finds the structure to be adequate, the pile will be accepted at the lesser pile
 penetration.
 5. Concrete Filled Pipe Piles. After driving pile, clean out the pile to the bottom of concrete
 elevation specified in the Contract documents. If there is a delay between cleanout and
 placing concrete, verify that the soil level in the pile has not rebounded before placing
 concrete.
 505-3.04 SPLICES, EXTENSIONS AND BUILD-UPS. If the length of a steel pile is not sufficient
 to obtain the minimum penetration and driving resistance specified in the Contract documents,
 the pile may be spliced in order to obtain the length required to reach the minimum penetration
 and driving resistance. Use pile additions with cross sections identical to the pile cross sections.
 
 223
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 505
 
 Make splices with complete joint penetration welds over the entire cross section. If approved,
 piles may be spliced using pile cut-offs and short pieces if no piece used is less than 10 feet long.
 Meet the welding requirements of Section 504. Align the piles at a splice to meet the dimensional
 tolerances for the allowable variation in straightness of welded columns in AWS D1.1.
 505-3.05 DEFECTIVE PILES. Use a pile driving method which does not damage the pile. Do not
 manipulate the piles to force them into proper position. Correct damaged or improperly driven
 piles using a method approved by the Engineer. Drive down all piles pushed up by driving
 adjacent piles or by any other cause. Approved methods may include one of the following:
 1. Withdraw and replace the pile with a new and, when necessary, longer pile.
 2. Drive a second pile adjacent to the defective pile.
 3. Splice or build up the pile.
 4. Extend a sufficient portion of the footing to properly imbed the pile.
 505-3.06 CUTTING OFF PILES. Cut off the piles at the elevations indicated on the Plans. Ensure
 that all injured material is removed.
 When steel piles are shown embedded in concrete footings or pile caps, cut off piles within -1/2
 inch to +3 inches of the plan embedment, but do not interfere with reinforcing steel or other items
 embedded in concrete. When steel pipe piles are shown cutoff below concrete footings or pile
 caps, cut off piles within -1/2 inch to +1/2 inch of the plan elevation. In pile bents with steel cap
 beams, make accurate cut-offs to ensure full bearing between the caps and piles.
 505-4.01 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. Section 109 and as follows:
 Furnish Piles. The sum of the lengths of the piles in place in the completed structure, measured
 from the tip of pile to the cut-off elevation.
 Drive Piles. The number of piles driven which are incorporated into the completed structure.
 Sheet Piles. The projected area of furnished and driven sheet piles remaining in place in the
 permanent structure as called for on the Plans, measured in final position.
 505-5.01 BASIS OF PAYMENT.
 Furnish Piles. The contract price includes pile materials delivered to the site, pile shoes,
 reinforced tips and casing. Unused pile lengths removed by cut-offs and fresh heading are
 subsidiary. The payment amount will be calculated using the quantity of pile indicated on the bid
 schedule, or the quantity of installed piles, whichever is greater.
 Drive Piles. The contract price includes:
 1. All related work required to drive the piles to the minimum penetration and driving resistance,
 including: pile crew time (including payroll and administrative additives), equipment costs,
 and other fixed or variable items incurred during pile driving, the construction of temporary
 work platforms, fresh heading, splicing, restrike, pile cleanout and cutting off.
 2. All related work required to construct preformed pile holes in locations identified in the
 Contract and sand backfill material.
 3. All related work required to assist the Engineer in performing High Strain Dynamic Testing is
 subsidiary.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 506-3.01 GENERAL. Employ competent bridge carpenters. Framing must be true and exact. Set
 the heads of nails and spikes flush with the wood surface. Workmanship on all metal parts must
 conform to specified requirements.
 Stack all lumber and timber at the worksite to prevent warping. Open-stack untreated material at
 least 12 inches above the ground surface so that the pile will shed water. When required, cover
 untreated timber to protect it from the weather. Close-stack treated timber above the ground on
 blocks or lagging. Clear weeds and rubbish underneath and around all stacks.
 Locate all non-removable erection marks on fabricated timber so they are hidden from view in the
 completed work.
 Do not drag or drop timber members. Use web-belting slings and chokers to handle timber
 members. Protect corners with protection angles or blocking at pickup points.
 The estimated quantity of treated timber shown on the Plans is approximate only and no
 guarantee is made that it is the exact quantity to be furnished. Glued-laminated timber quantities
 shown on the Plans indicate gross quantities of timber, based on nominal dimensions and actual
 lengths before final planing of the laminated member.
 506-3.02 TREATED TIMBER. Fabricate timber (including all cutting, shaping, and boring) before
 treatment. Handle timber carefully without dropping, breaking the outer fibers, or bruising or
 penetrating the surface with tools. In coastal waters, avoid cutting and boring below the high-

 from bolt heads and nuts. Use cast-iron washers with a thickness equal to the diameter of the bolt
 and with a diameter 4 times its thickness. Use malleable or plate washers with diameter or side
 dimensions of the square equal to 4 times the diameter of the bolt, and thickness equal to 1/2 the
 diameter of the bolt. Use cast-iron washers when the timber is in contact with the earth. Check or
 burr all nuts with a pointed tool after final tightening to prevent turning.
 506-3.06 COUNTERSINKING. Countersink bolts where smooth faces are required. Paint
 recesses formed for countersinking, except in railing, with pentachlorophenol or creosote oil. After
 bolts or screws are in place, fill the recesses with hot pitch or mastic sealer. Countersink
 fasteners for attaching glu-lam deck panels to their supporting members below the top surface of
 the deck. After installation, fill all fastener recesses in the top surface of the deck with mastic
 sealer.
 506-3.07 FRAMING. Cut all lumber and timber accurately and frame to a close fit so that the
 joints bear weight evenly over all contact surfaces without shimming.
 506-3.08 FRAMING BENTS. Bed mud sills firmly and evenly to solid bearing. Tamp them in
 place.
 Carefully finish concrete pedestals for supporting framed bents so that posts will bear evenly on
 them. Set dowels for anchoring posts when the concrete is cast.

 by removal operations. Remove all rust and corrosive products immediately prior to concrete
 placement. Remove oil, dirt, concrete fragments, laitance, loose scale, and other coating that
 would destroy or inhibit the bond with the new concrete.
 Protect cleaned reinforcing steel from the elements and from contamination. Sandblast
 reinforcing steel contaminated as a result of your failure to provide adequate protection, at
 your expense.
 510-3.05 MECHANICAL METHODS. In areas not accessible to hydrodemolition remove concrete
 by mechanical impact methods to the same depth as adjacent areas. Avoid damage to sound
 concrete structures by the improper use of mechanical tools. Repair, cracked or damaged
 structures, as required.
 Also use mechanical methods if either of the following conditions exists:
 1. There is unsound concrete remaining after the hydrodemolition is done in an area
 2. There is a lack of bond between the existing concrete and the reinforcing steel
 If unsound concrete exists or if the bond is broken around existing reinforcing steel, remove
 concrete to provide a 3/4 inch minimum clearance around the reinforcing steel. Do not damage
 any of the existing reinforcing steel that is to remain in place.
 Operate the mechanical impact tool at angles less than 45 degrees as measured from the deck
 surface to the tool. Do not use jack hammers heavier than the nominal 30 lb class or chipping
 hammers heavier than the nominal 15 lb class.

 512-3.03 FALSEWORK CONSTRUCTION. Construct falsework to conform to the approved
 falsework plan. Do not begin falsework construction without an approved falsework plan. Do not
 modify or alter the structure to accommodate falsework unless otherwise noted or authorized by
 the Engineer.
 When welding falsework, meet the welding requirements of Section 504.
 Build camber into the falsework to compensate for falsework deflection and anticipated structure
 deflection. Camber shown on the Plans or specified by the Engineer is for anticipated structure
 deflection only.
 Do not use driven devices to attach falsework to concrete. Do not modify or alter the structure to
 attach falsework unless otherwise noted or authorized by the Engineer.
 512-3.04 FORMS. For surfaces that are exposed in the completed work, use plywood forms
 meeting the requirements of the American Plywood Association (APA) grade High Density
 Overlaid (HDO) Plyform Class I or other approved material that will produce an equivalent smooth
 and uniform concrete surface. For other surfaces, use plywood forms meeting the requirements
 of the American Plywood Association (APA) grade B-B Plyform Class I. Use only form panels in
 good condition free of defects on surfaces in contact with concrete.
 Furnish and place form panels for exposed surfaces in uniform widths of not less than 3 feet and
 in uniform lengths of not less than 6 feet except where the width of the member formed is less
 than 3 feet.
 Arrange form panels in symmetrical patterns conforming to the general lines of the structure.
 Place panels for vertical surfaces with the long dimension horizontal and with horizontal joints
 level and continuous. For walls with sloping footings that do not abut other walls, placement of
 panels with the long dimension parallel to the footing is permitted.
 Follow the manufacturer’s written recommendations when using form liners.
 Increase the thickness of concrete members that receive an architectural finish to maintain the
 specified cover to reinforcing steel.
 Bevel exposed corners and edges with 3/4 inch chamfers built into the forms.

 SECTION 512
 
 Do not modify or alter the structure to attach forms unless otherwise noted or authorized by the
 Engineer. Form ties, anchors, and other devices may be cast into the concrete for supporting
 forms or for lifting precast members. Ensure form ties and anchors can be removed without
 damaging the concrete surface. Do not use driven devices to attach forms to concrete. Do not
 use anchors coated with materials that will stain the concrete for supporting forms. Construct
 metal ties or anchorages within the forms to permit their removal to a depth of at least 1 inch from
 the concrete surface without damage to the concrete.
 Construct concrete forms mortar-tight. Clean the inside surfaces of forms free of contaminants
 that affect the concrete finish. When forms are supported by existing concrete, ensure the forms
 fit tightly against the existing concrete and mortar will not pass through the joint.
 Forms may be omitted when the sides of a footing excavation is in rock. If the excavation is larger
 than the plan dimensions, any additional concrete placed will be at the Contractor’s expense.
 Coat forms to be removed with form release agent prior to use. Use a commercial quality product,
 designed specifically to release forms, and that will not discolor the concrete surfaces.
 512-3.05 FORMS AND FALSEWORK FOR CONCRETE DECKS. Use forms and falsework that
 span between adjacent girders without altering or damaging the supporting girders. Hangers may
 be cast into the concrete for supporting deck falsework. Do not use driven devices to attach forms
 or falsework to concrete. Do not use materials that will stain the concrete to support the
 falsework. Construct hangers to permit their removal to a depth of at least 1 inch from the
 concrete surface without damage to the concrete.
 Adjust the falsework haunch dimensions to accommodate the camber and elevation of the
 installed girders. Measure the installed girder elevations along the centerline of the girders at
 locations shown on the Plans after erection but before installing falsework, forms, reinforcing
 steel, or applying other loads. Determine the required haunch dimensions accounting for the
 variations in the girder elevations and anticipated deflection due to additional dead loads.
 Prestressed concrete girder elevations shown on the Plans are based on estimated girder
 deflections at 40 and 120 days after release of the prestressing strands. The girder elevations
 shown in the Plans are intended to advise the Contractor as to the expected range of girder
 deflection at the time of deck forming.
 Construct falsework supporting concrete work on steel structures so that loads applied to girder
 webs are applied within 6 inch of the flange or stiffener. Construct Falsework to distribute loads
 so that local distortion of the web is not produced.
 1. Forms. Do not use permanent forms including metal, wood, or precast concrete for concrete
 deck construction, unless otherwise noted. Provide concrete deck forms meeting the
 following requirements:
 a. Maintain the deck thickness despite irregularities in and between the girders.
 b. Accommodate haunch variation along the length and between the girders.
 2. Haunches. Limit haunch dimensions to meet the following requirements:
 a. 1/2 inch maximum embedment of the top flange into the deck measured at the edge of
 the flange.
 b. 2-1/2 inch minimum clearance between the top of deck and shear stud or shear stirrup.
 c.
 
 2 inch minimum penetration of shear stud or shear stirrup into the deck.
 
 241
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 512
 
 d. 4 inch maximum haunch measured at the centerline of the girder.
 512-3.06 REMOVAL OF FORMS AND FALSEWORK. Remove forms and falsework without
 damaging the concrete member.
 Forms may be removed after the concrete has cured for at least 24 hours, will not be damaged,
 and has a compressive strength of at least 1400 psi as determined from informational field test
 cylinders cured on the site under temperature and moisture conditions similar to the concrete in
 the structure. Protect exposed concrete surfaces from damage. Maintain curing operations
 according to Section 501 if forms are removed before curing operations may be terminated.
 Completely remove forms, including the roadway deck forms, from cells of box girders which
 have permanent access. Unless otherwise shown in the Plans, the roadway slab interior forms in
 cells where no permanent access is available may be left in place.
 Falsework may be removed after the concrete has a compressive strength, determined from
 informational field test cylinders cured on the site under temperature and moisture conditions
 similar to the concrete in the structure, as specified in Table 512-1. If informational field test
 cylinders are not available, meet the minimum number of curing days specified in Table 512-1.
 Do not release falsework for cast-in-place prestressed portions of structures until the prestressing
 steel has been tensioned.

 513-3.10 SURFACE PREPARATION. Before beginning any other cleaning, pressure wash all
 surfaces scheduled for painting. Remove all dirt, grease, loose chalky paint, salts, or other foreign
 material.
 Do not pressure wash surfaces more than 2 weeks before painting or cleaning.
 Use a pressure washer with at least 3000 psi at all elevations. Keep the nozzle tip no more than
 12 inches from the surface during all phases of power washing.
 Perform pressure washing with potable water. If needed, add a biodegradable detergent to the
 pressure washer feed water or apply it directly to the surface to be cleaned. Apply the detergent
 using methods that remove all surface contaminants.
 Before abrasive blasting, grind smooth all metal defects, fins, slivers, burrs, weld spatter, and
 sharp edges resulting from shearing or similar operations, including flame-hardened edges
 resulting from cutting or burning. Grind flame-hardened edges a minimum of 1/16 inch. Document
 all weld defects and report them to the Engineer immediately.
 Abrasive blast clean all metal to be coated to SSPC-SP10/NACE #2, Near-white Blast Cleaning.
 Remove all mill scale. Match the appearance of the abrasive blast cleaned area to Pictorial
 Standard SSPC-VIS-1-89 and NACE TMO170/NACE #2. Produce a surface profile neither
 detrimental to the coating performance nor contrary to the coating manufacturer's written
 instructions.
 Repair all defects that become evident after abrasive blasting or applying a prime coat. Retexture
 the surface to match the blasted profile.
 Clean all abrasive-blast-cleaned surfaces and staging surfaces by brushing, vacuum cleaning, or
 blowing with dry, oil-free compressed air. Do not wipe down surfaces with rags. Remove all loose
 blast material from the work area. Make sure all surfaces to be coated are free of contaminants
 and moisture.
 Coat all abrasive blast cleaned surfaces in the same working shift. Reclean and inspect all
 surfaces not coated within 12 hours or if they show contamination or rust bloom. The Engineer
 may approve additional time between abrasive blast cleaning and coating under controlled
 humidity conditions.
 
 249
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 513
 
 To prevent contaminating cleaned or coated surfaces, do not pressure wash or abrasive blast
 clean in adjacent areas when also applying coatings or drying coated surfaces.
 Prevent contaminating the cleaned surfaces with any oil, grease, soil, dust, foreign matter, salts,
 acids, alkali, or other corrosive chemicals before applying the prime coat and remaining coats.
 Remove any contamination from the surface before applying other coats.
 513-3.11 WEATHER LIMITATIONS. Apply coatings within the environmental limitations
 recommended by the coating manufacturer. Do not apply coatings:
 1. where dust is generated;
 2. in fog, snow, or rain;
 3. on surfaces that are wet or damp; or
 4. when surface temperature is below 35 °F or above 120 °F.
 When necessary, control the containment environment to comply with material specifications and
 meet the completion date.
 513-3.12 PAINTING METAL SURFACES.
 Supply enough materials on the job site to satisfy all coat time windows and recoating
 requirements.
 Do not open paint containers until ready to use. Keep partial containers sealed.
 Do not use paints that have begun to polymerize, solidify, gel or deteriorate.
 Remove and discard paint skin before mixing. Do not use paint if the volume of skin on the
 surface or sides of the container exceeds 2 percent.
 Use the oldest paint or component first. Apply coating by spraying. Use daubers or sheepskins
 when no other application method is practical in places that are difficult to access. Use dipping,
 roller coating, or flow coating only when specifically authorized.
 Apply stripe coating before applying each coat. Spot paint or stripe all edges, corner crevices,
 rivets, bolts, welds, and sharp edges before fully coating the steel. Make sure that striping
 extends at least 2 inches from the edge. Evenly distribute the stripe coat and work it well into
 joints, corners, and crevices. Use coating techniques that result in a uniform wet pattern or that
 comply with the coating manufacturer's written instructions.
 Apply paint to the following dry film thickness(DFT):
 Prime Coat:
 Intermediate Coat:
 Top Coat:
 
 3 to 5 mils
 3 to 5 mils
 3 to 5 mils
 
 If necessary, apply several coats to achieve the proper thickness. Apply each coat as a
 continuous film of uniform thickness, free of pores. Make sure all coats are free of runs, sags, and
 dry spray. Repaint any thin spots or areas missed in the application.
 Make sure each coat is properly cured or dried before applying the next coat.
 If any applied coating is damaged, mud cracked, bubbling or blistering, permit it to dry first.
 Remove damaged areas of paint and prepare the surface again. Feather the edges of existing
 paint out to 1/2 inch surrounding the spot-cleaned area. Make sure no loose or abrupt edges of
 
 250
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 513
 
 paint remain. Repaint the area with the same kind and number of coats as the undamaged area
 according to the manufacturer's written recommendations. Evenly blend the final spot coat of
 repair with the surrounding coating.
 For final inspection, make sure the top coat is uniform and complete in coverage and
 appearance. The Engineer will visually inspect the top coat and determine acceptance by total
 DFT.

 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 515
 
 Construct drilled shafts according to the Contract Documents except when permitted otherwise by
 the Engineer. An alternate method of shaft construction may be proposed. Acceptance of other
 proposed shaft installation methods will be based upon the suitability of the method to the site
 conditions and the effect of the method on the structural system. Submit alternate methods of
 shaft construction for approval.
 Maintain a construction method and soil log during shaft excavation. Submit copies of the log
 daily. Resolve all differences in the production logs between the Engineer and the Contractor
 within 24 hours of submittal to the Engineer. Provide the log to the CSL Inspector within 3 days of
 placing shaft concrete. Provide at least the following items in the log:

 elevation and leave the remainder of the casing in place.
 515-3.03 POSITION AND ALIGNMENT. When drilling from a barge, provide a fixed template,
 adequate to maintain shaft position and alignment during all excavation and concreting
 operations. Do not use floating templates (attached to a barge). A fixed template for shafts drilled
 on land will not be required if the Contractor demonstrates satisfactorily to the Engineer that shaft
 position and alignment can be properly maintained. The Engineer will require a fixed template
 adequate to maintain shaft position and alignment during all excavation and concreting
 operations for shafts drilled on land when the Contractor fails to demonstrate to the Engineer’s
 satisfaction that he can properly maintain shaft position and alignment without use of a template.
 515-3.04 EXCAVATIONS AND EQUIPMENT. All shaft excavation from the groundline to the top
 of bedrock, including the rubble layer, is Unclassified Shaft Excavation. All shaft excavation from
 the top of bedrock to the bottom of the shaft is Special Shaft Excavation. Groundline, top of
 bedrock and bottom of shaft elevations are shown on the Plans. The Engineer may require
 Drilled Shaft Sidewall Overreaming.
 
 255
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 515

 dimensions shown in the Contract Documents, completed and accepted. Include in the work
 all shaft excavation, whether the material encountered is soil, rock, boulders, weathered rock,
 stone, natural or man-made obstructions, or any other materials. Special Shaft Excavation
 begins either when top of bedrock elevation is reached or when drilling operations using
 conventional equipment reach practical refusal. Practical refusal is defined as the point
 where the rate of hole advancement using earth augers with soil or rock teeth, drill buckets,
 and/or under reaming tools with the drilling equipment operating at maximum power, torque
 and downthrust, is less than 1 foot after 15 minutes of continuous drilling.
 2. Special Shaft Excavation. All processes required to excavate a drilled shaft of the dimensions
 shown in the Contract Documents, completed and accepted. Include in the work all shaft
 excavation, whether the material encountered is soil, rock, boulders, weathered rock, stone,
 natural or man-made obstructions, or any other materials. Payment for excavation below the
 point where Special Shaft Excavation has been authorized will be for Special Shaft
 Excavation only and will not include payment for Unclassified Shaft Excavation.
 3. Drilled Shaft Sidewall Overreaming. The excavation required to enlarge the drilled shaft
 diameter to accommodate the installation of the permanent metal casing. Increase the shaft
 radius a maximum of 6 inches by overreaming.
 If the Engineer determines that the material encountered while drilling the shaft excavation is
 unsuitable and/or is not the same as anticipated in the design of the drilled shaft, extend the
 drilled shaft excavations as required by the Engineer.
 Provide areas for the disposal of unsuitable materials and excess materials that are removed
 from shaft excavations, and dispose of them subject to permit requirements and in a manner
 meeting all requirements pertaining to the approved storm water pollution prevention (SWPP)
 plan.
 Use excavation and drilling equipment having adequate capacity, power, torque, and downthrust
 to perform the work. Use excavation and overreaming tools of adequate design, size, and
 strength to perform the work. If the material encountered cannot be drilled using conventional
 earth augers and/or underreaming tools, provide special drilling equipment, including but not
 limited to rock augers, core barrels, rock tools, air tools, blasting materials, and other equipment
 as necessary to continue the shaft excavation to the size and depth required.
 515-3.05 CASINGS. Use casings that are of ample strength to withstand handling and driving
 stresses and the pressure of concrete and surrounding earth materials. Casing may be thickened
 or reinforced to withstand applied stresses. Internally brace casing during shipping.
 Use casings that are smooth and water tight. Provide a casing that is continuous along the entire
 length of the shaft. Use complete joint penetration (CJP) welds for casing splices. Verify weld
 quality by performing ultrasonic testing (UT) weld splices. Provide UT test reports to the Engineer
 for approval prior to advancing the casing.
 Ensure that the inside diameter of casing is not less than the specified size of shaft. Oversized
 casing may be used with the Engineer’s written approval. The Department will not provide extra
 compensation for excess concrete required to fill an oversize casing.

 2. Depth. Reference the depth of the shaft during drilling using marks on the Kelly bar or other
 suitable methods. Measure final shaft depths with a suitable weighted tape or other approved
 methods after final cleaning.
 3. Shaft Cleanliness Requirements. Clean the shaft so that at least 50 percent of the base of
 each shaft has less than 3/4 inch of sediment at the time of concrete placement. Ensure that
 the maximum depth of sedimentary deposits or other debris does not exceed 1½ inches at
 any location on the bottom of the excavation. The Engineer will approve shaft cleanliness
 based on visual inspection for dry shafts. The Engineer will approve shaft cleanliness using
 divers, Shaft Inspection Device (SID) or other appropriate methods for wet shafts.
 4. Casing. Visually inspect casings above water. Use a SID, diver, or other methods as directed
 by the Engineer to examine the casings below water for defects.
 515-3.07 REINFORCING STEEL CONSTRUCTION AND PLACEMENT.
 1. Reinforcement Cage Construction and Placement. Tie all intersections of drilled shaft
 reinforcing steel with cross ties or "figure 8" ties. Use double strand ties or ties with larger tie
 wire when necessary. The Engineer will give final approval of the cage construction subject to
 satisfactory performance in the field.
 Assemble and place as a single unit the cage of reinforcing steel consisting of; longitudinal
 bars, ties, spirals, cage stiffener bars, CSL tubes and all other components. Place the cage
 immediately after the Engineer inspects and accepts the shaft excavation and immediately
 prior to placing concrete. The Engineer will give final approval of the placement subject to
 satisfactory performance in the field.
 2. Splicing Reinforcement Cage. If the bottom of the constructed shaft elevation is lower than
 the bottom of the shaft elevation in the plans, extend a minimum of one half of the
 longitudinal bars required in the lower portion of the shaft the additional length. Continue the
 tie bars throughout the extra depth and extend the stiffener bars to the final depth. Splice the
 longitudinal bar extensions as required.
 3. Support, Alignment, and Tolerance. Tie and support the reinforcing steel in the shaft so that
 the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable tolerances as specified in Section 515-3.10.

 550-3.03 PLACING CONCRETE. Prepare foundations according to Section 204 or as specified
 for the applicable pay item. Use forms designed and constructed according to Section 512 or as
 specified for the applicable pay item. Ensure forms, reinforcing steel, and other embedded items
 are free of concrete splatter and other foreign material. Remove standing water from within the
 forms. Moisten foundations and forms with water before the concrete is placed. Prevent
 movement of forms, reinforcing steel, and other embedded items.
 Ensure the concrete temperature is between 50°F and 90°F when placed. Place and consolidate
 each layer before the preceding layer takes initial set. Limit layer thickness to the capacity of the
 vibrators to consolidate and merge the concrete with the previous layer. Do not place concrete
 that has developed initial set.
 Place concrete as near as possible to its final position. Prevent segregation of the mix. Do not
 deposit a large quantity of concrete and run or work the concrete along the forms. Limit the freefall height of the concrete to less than 5 feet. When pumping concrete use a pump producing a
 continuous stream of concrete without air pockets.
 550-3.04 CONSOLIDATION OF CONCRETE. Consolidate fresh concrete within 15 minutes of
 placement. Consolidate concrete using mechanical vibrators to make an impervious, dense,
 homogeneous mass free of voids and rock pockets. Vibrate in a uniform pattern spaced less than
 1.5 times the radius of visible effectiveness. Effectively vibrate the full depth of each layer.
 Do not vibrate concrete that has initially set. Do not hold vibrators against reinforcing steel or use
 vibrators to flow or spread the concrete into place. Do not allow the concrete to segregate, form
 pools of mortar, or form laitance on the surface.
 550-3.05 FINISHING CONCRETE SURFACES. After the concrete is consolidated and prior to
 the application of curing materials, strike-off unformed concrete surfaces to the required elevation
 and slope. Finish the surface by floating to remove local irregularities. Leave sufficient mortar to
 seal the concrete surface. Do not use mortar topping for concrete surfaces. Do not use aluminum
 finishing equipment.
 Complete initial floating operations before bleed water or excess moisture is present on the
 surface and before the concrete develops initial set. Complete final finishing before final set
 occurs. Do not use finishing aids or additional water to assist in finishing concrete surfaces. Do
 not finish concrete surfaces if bleed water is present.
 1. Ordinary Finish. Immediately after removing the forms, remove the devices holding the forms
 in place and passing through the body of the concrete, or cut them back at least 1 inch
 beneath the concrete surface. Remove fins of mortar and irregularities caused by form joints.
 Ensure the surface is true and even.
 Patch cavities greater than ¼ inch. Fill the cavity with stiff mortar composed of one part
 Portland cement to two parts fine aggregate with only enough water to form a ball when
 squeezed gently by hand. Clean and wet the cavity before filling. Thoroughly tamp the
 mixture into place. Float the surface of the mortar before initial set to make the surface neat
 in appearance. Cure the patch according to Subsection 550-3.06.
 
 273
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 550
 
 2. Curb, Curb Ramp, and Sidewalk. Broom finish exposed faces of curb, curb ramp, and
 sidewalk to true surfaces. Broom finish sidewalks perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
 550-3.06 CURING CONCRETE. Begin curing immediately after final finishing. Maintain curing for
 at least 72 hours. During the curing period, keep the concrete at a satisfactory moisture content
 and at a temperature of at least 50°F.
 1. Water Curing. Completely cover exposed concrete surfaces with wet burlap or wet cotton
 mats. Keep mats completely wet during the curing period. Do not allow concrete surfaces to
 dry or alternate with wetting and drying cycles. If wood forms can remain in place during the
 curing period, do not loosen forms and keep the forms moist at all times to prevent opening at
 joints.
 2. Membrane Curing. Uniformly apply two coats of liquid membrane-forming compound, with the
 second coat at a right angle to the first, until the original color of the concrete is obscured.
 Apply liquid membrane-forming compound according to the Manufacturer’s instructions. Reapply liquid membrane-forming compound if the membrane becomes cracked or damaged.
 550-3.07 PROTECTION OF CONCRETE. Protect concrete from damage. Do not apply loads to
 the concrete until curing operations are completed and until the concrete has attained sufficient
 strength to safely carry the applied loads without damage. Forms may be removed after the
 concrete has cured for at least 24 hours and will not be damaged. Remove and replace concrete
 damaged by rain, flowing water, frost action, or overheating at no cost to the Department.
 1.
 
 Rain Protection. Provide materials and equipment on site to protect concrete until final set.
 During precipitation, or when the Engineer determines precipitation is likely before final set,
 employ materials and equipment to protect the concrete until final set occurs. Do not expose
 the concrete to rain or flowing water before final set occurs.
 
 2.
 
 Cold Temperature Protection. Protect the concrete during cold weather operations. At least
 5 days before placing submit a cold weather concreting plan when air temperatures below
 40°F are expected during placement or curing. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the plan
 and put it into effect before placing any concrete when the air temperature in the shade,
 away from artificial heat, is below 40°F or, in the opinion of the Engineer, will likely become
 so during placement or curing.
 Have in place the materials and equipment required to prevent the concrete from freezing.
 Before placing concrete, warm forms and reinforcing steel to remove frost, ice, and snow
 from surfaces that will contact fresh concrete. When fresh concrete will contact hardened
 concrete, warm the surface of the hardened concrete to at least 40°F. Do not place concrete
 on a frozen foundation.
 Maintain concrete curing temperature and moisture. Do not expose concrete surfaces to air
 with a temperature greater than 90°F. At the end of the curing period, remove the protection
 so the concrete drops in temperature gradually and not more than 30°F in the first 24 hours.
 If water curing is used, allow the concrete surface to dry prior to exposure of the concrete to
 freezing temperatures.
 Protection may be terminated when the air temperature in the shade rises to 40°F and is
 expected to remain at least 40°F until the end of the curing period.
 
 3.
 
 Hot Temperature Protection. Protect the concrete during hot weather operations. At least 5
 days before placing submit a hot weather concreting plan when air temperatures above 90°F
 are expected during placement or curing. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the plan and put
 it into effect before placing any concrete when the air temperature in direct sunlight is above
 90°F or in the opinion of the Engineer, will likely become so during placement or curing.

 to form a flexible, watertight seal. When using oakum, caulk the joint and then seal it with the
 specified material.
 When using portland cement mixtures, protect the completed joints against rapid drying using
 suitable covering material.
 2. Metal Pipe. Join metal pipe firmly using one of the following types of coupling bands. Use
 bands that are no more than two nominal sheet thicknesses lighter than the pipe being
 joined, and in no case more than 0.052 inches lighter.
 a. Primary Band. Furnish and install corrugated bands so that the band corrugations match
 and conform to the corrugations of the pipe. Conform to the following guidelines:
 (1) The gap between the pipe being joined is in the center of the band and is no wider
 than one corrugation width.
 (2) Bands for 12-inch through 30 inch diameter pipe are at least 12 inches wide.
 (3) Bands for pipe with diameters greater than 30 inches are at least 22 inches wide.
 b. Secondary Band. Use this band only where it is not physically possible to use primary
 bands, such as on field-cut pipe ends, joining new pipe to existing pipe, etc. Furnish and
 install deformed metal sheet bands (dimple bands) so that the projections match and are
 the same depth as the pipe corrugations. Form these projections in circumferential rows
 with one projection for each corrugation of the helical pipe.
 Conform to the following guidelines:
 (1) The gap between the pipe being joined is in the center of the band and is no wider
 than 2 inches.
 (2) Bands for 12-inch diameter pipe are at least 12 inches wide and have one
 circumferential row of projections for each pipe end being joined.
 (3) Bands for pipe with diameters greater than 12 inches are at least 24 inches wide and
 have two circumferential rows of projections for each pipe end being joined.
 (4) Furnish and install these bands with a gasket that resists infiltration and leakage.
 3. Polyethylene Pipe. Ensure that polyethylene pipe couplings are corrugated to match the pipe
 corrugations and that their width is not less than one half the nominal pipe diameter.
 Furnish all bolted connections on coupling bands with cutwashers placed between the nut and
 the angle bracket or use nuts with integral washers.
 Take up any pipe that is out of alignment, unduly settled, or damaged and re-lay or replace it.

 with the Standard Drawings and these Specifications.
 At locations where public traffic is adjacent to guardrail work, have all materials on site, including
 crashworthy terminals, that are required to completely install a segment of guardrail before
 beginning work on that segment.
 Start guardrail installation at the “upstream” end (the end adjacent traffic will encounter first) by
 either installing a crashworthy terminal or connecting to an existing barrier. Continue installation
 in the direction of traffic. Exception: if the guardrail run will connect to existing barrier, buried in
 the backslope, or guardrail, existing or new bridge railing, or other existing structure at the
 “downstream” end, guardrail installation may be started at the point of connection.
 Do not leave posts installed for guardrail within the clear zone for more than 48 hours before
 installing the rail. At the end of each work shift, install drums or Type II barricades with flashing
 warning lights to delineate incomplete sections of guardrail and terminal sections.
 If guardrail runs are not completed within 10 calendar days after beginning installation, install
 temporary crash cushions meeting NCHRP 350 or MASH test level 3 at all non-crashworthy
 guardrail ends within the clear zone. Apply Traffic Price Adjustment if the Contractor does not
 comply with the crash cushion requirement.

 Any one of the types of chain link fabric specified in Section 710 may be furnished under Item
 607(3), Chain link Fence. Intermixing fabric types is not allowed.
 607-3.01 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Clear and grub as necessary to construct the
 fence to the required grade and alignment.
 Before installing fence, grade the existing ground along the fence line to a smooth, uniform
 surface so there are no abrupt grade changes between adjacent fence posts.
 At locations where breaks in a run of fencing are required, or at intersections with existing fences,
 adjust post spacing to conform to the requirements for the type of closure indicated.
 When the Plans require that posts, braces, or anchors be imbedded in concrete, install temporary
 guys or braces as required to hold the posts in proper position until the concrete has set
 sufficiently to hold the posts. Do not install any materials on posts or place strain on guys and
 bracing set in concrete until 7 days after placing the concrete.
 Set the tops of all posts to the required grade and alignment. Do not cut the tops of the posts.
 In areas where muck excavation is designated on the Plans or in unstable areas as determined
 by the Engineer, drive fence posts as shown on the Plans or as directed.
 Attach the required size and type of wire or fencing firmly to the posts and braces in the manner
 indicated. Stretch all wire taut and install it to the required elevations.
 At each location where an electric transmission, distribution, or secondary line crosses any of the
 types of fences covered by these Specifications, furnish and install a ground rod and connection
 to the fence meeting the requirements of Section 9 of the NESC.
 Place ground rods and connectors at maximum intervals of 400 feet along the fence. When fence
 runs are less than 400 feet long, place one ground rod with connection to the fence.
 Coordinate fence construction operations so that livestock do not escape. Connect existing cross
 fences to the new posts. Place braces for every direction of strain at the junction with existing
 fences. Fasten the wire in both fences properly to the posts. At bridges, cattle passes, and at
 
 290
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 607
 
 culverts if shown on the Plans, connect the new fence to the structure so that livestock can pass
 freely through or under the structure.
 Fasten fence fabric and wire to the highway side of the posts.
 Treat changes in line where the angle of deflection is 30 degrees or more as a corner. Install
 corner posts.
 Treat changes in line where the angle deflection is between 15 and 30 degrees as alignment
 angles. Fasten adjacent posts to the angle posts using wire. If using wire is impracticable, brace
 the posts as detailed on the Plans for gate, end, and center posts.
 At all grade deflections and alignment angles where stresses tend to pull the posts from the
 ground, snub or guy the fencing at the critical point using a double strand of 9 gage galvanized
 wire. Connect the wire to each horizontal line of barbed wire, or to the top and bottom of wire
 mesh fabric, and to a deadman weighing approximately 100 pounds, buried in the ground not less
 than 2 feet. Pull the fencing snug to the ground before snubbing or guying.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 621-3.01 TEMPORARY STORAGE. Where temporary storage or heeling-in of plants is required,
 provide and prepare a suitable heeling-in ground or a well-ventilated and cool storage shed,
 located near the planting site, before shipping planting stock.
 Heel-in or properly store all acceptable planting stock if not planted within 24 hours, as follows:
 1.
 
 Balled and Burlapped Plants. Temporarily store in a protected area with balls 6 inches
 apart. Fill voids with moist mulch up to and including the top of the ball.
 
 2.
 
 Bare-Rooted Plants. Puddle immediately, then heel-in by placing the plants, properly
 spread, in a trench and covering the roots with moist topsoil.
 
 Protect bare root plants adequately at all times. Plants left out of the ground unprotected
 overnight, left with roots exposed to the sun, or improperly protected during transit, unloading,
 heeling-in, or during the planting operation, are unacceptable.
 Protect the roots of plants stored in a shed at all times using moist straw or other approved
 material. Water as required.
 621-3.02 ADVANCE PREPARATION AND CLEANUP. After clearing and grubbing of the area is
 complete, remove any stones, sticks, stumps, clods, and other debris which might interfere with
 growth or maintenance. Repair any subsequent damage from erosion or other causes.
 Prepare areas which will receive group plantings with generally curving outlines.
 621-3.03 PLANTING. Perform all planting work using good horticultural practices.
 1. Plant Season.
 a. Locally Grown: Transplant Alaska-grown native or exotic species in the fall of the year,
 following leaf drop.
 b. Imported: Handle and transplant out-of-state plants, according to the nursery
 recommendations.
 2. Excavation.
 a. Keep topsoil separate from underlying layers and render it loose and friable. Remove any
 material detrimental to plant growth and dispose of it at approved locations.
 b. Make pits for trees at least 2-5 times the diameter of the root ball or the spread root
 system of bare-root trees. Make the depths of pits for trees at least 2 feet and as much
 
 321
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 621
 
 deeper as may be necessary to provide a minimum depth of 9 inches below the bottom of
 the ball or spread root system of the tree when placed at the proper elevation.
 c.
 
 Make pits for shrubs at least 2 times the diameter of the root ball or spread root system.
 Keep the depths of pits for shrubs at least 12 inches and as much deeper as may be
 necessary to provide 6 inches minimum below the bottom of the ball or spread root
 system when the shrub is placed at the proper elevation.
 
 d. Ensure that the dimensions of pits, pockets, or trenches for vines, ground covers, and
 similar types of plants will provide space for the spread root system. Keep the depth and
 width at least 6 inches below and around the root system.
 3. Pruning.
 a. Roots. Prune all damaged or broken main roots with a clean, oblique cut immediately
 above the point of damage.
 b. Branches. Use pruning techniques that conform to the best horticultural practices with
 due regard to natural or desired form and growth characteristics of the individual species.
 Preserve a single terminal leader when pruning. On all deciduous plants, remove 1/3 to
 1/2 of the potential leaf-bearing surface. Treat all cut surfaces that are 3/4 inch or more in
 diameter with tree wound dressing.
 4. Transplanting. Relocate plant material, within the limits of the project, designated for
 transplanting to areas shown on the drawings or as specified. Dig this material with root
 systems or balls as specified for collected stock and replant it the same way as new stock.
 5. Placing Plants.
 a. Set plants plumb on lightly tamped backfill mix and at a level so that the root collar will
 bear the same relation to the planting site as it bore to the ground from which it was dug.
 b. Handle balled and burlapped plants by the earth ball and not by the plant itself. Place the
 plants in holes without removing the burlap.
 c.
 
 Fill the hole with water before placing the plant. Place the backfill gradually, allowing the
 soil to soak up the water.
 
 6. Backfilling. Work backfill mix around the roots and firmly tamp it as it is filled into the holes to
 eliminate air pockets. Avoid bruising or breaking the roots while tamping or firming the backfill
 mix about them. Hold upright plants plumb during the backfilling operation. When the
 backfilling is 2/3 completed, loosen the exposed burlap and lay it back from the ball or cut off
 excess. After thorough watering, complete the backfilling. During backfilling, remove stocks,
 sod, clods, or other material that tend to form air pockets. Except in areas for shrub beds,
 construct a shallow basin of backfill mix approximately 3 inches deep and as wide as the
 diameter of the hole around each plant. On steep slopes, pull enough soil to the lower side of
 the plants to form shallow basins to catch and hold water. After the backfilling is completed,
 water the plant basins thoroughly.
 7. Wrapping. When specified, wrap the trunks of all deciduous shade and flowering trees with 4inch-wide waterproof paper, overlapping 1-1/2 inches, between the lowest main branches to
 the ground line. Tie the wrapping in at least 5 places, including top, middle, and bottom.
 Complete these protective measures within 4 days after planting.
 8. Staking and Guying.
 a. Immediately after planting, brace all evergreen trees 4 to 6 feet high and all deciduous
 trees 6 feet and over in height and less than 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Use a single stake
 
 322
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 621
 
 measuring at least 2 inches by 2 inches by 6 feet and place it 2 feet deep into the ground
 on the windward side to avoid injury to the root system. Connect the stake to the tree
 using approved binding straps.
 b. Immediately guy all deciduous trees 1-1/2 inches and over in diameter, and all evergreen
 trees 6 feet and over in height using 3 cables spaced approximately 120 degrees apart
 around the tree. Use cables each made of 2 No. 12 galvanized steel wires, free from
 bends and kinks, twisted into a strand. Fasten cables around the trunk immediately
 above a substantial limb wherever possible. Fasten cables around the trunk at a distance
 from the ground equal to 1/2 to 2/3 of the total height of the tree. Anchor cables to the
 ground at an equal distance away from the trunk. Protect the tree from damage caused
 by the cable using an approved method.
 c.
 
 Use other anchor stakes that are at least 2 inches x 2 inches x 2 feet. Drive the stakes at
 right angles to the guy wire. Ensure that the stakes do not extend more than 3 inches
 above the ground. Notch or drill the stakes to prevent cables from slipping.
 
 621-3.04 PERIOD OF ESTABLISHMENT. Establishment periods extend for one complete
 growing season following acceptable planting. Employ all possible means to preserve the plants
 in a healthy and vigorous condition to ensure successful establishment. During this period,
 perform the necessary weeding, spraying (with approved insecticides or fungicides), cultivating,
 remulching, and tightening or replacing guy wires and stakes as may be required. Water all
 shade, evergreen, and flowering trees as frequently as necessary to keep the immediate root
 areas moist at all times.
 The Engineer may, but is not required to, determine the Project is complete except for the period
 of establishment, and issue a letter of final acceptance. After final acceptance, work or materials
 due under this subsection during any remaining period of establishment are considered warranty
 obligations that continue to be due following final acceptance in accordance with Subsection 1051.16.
 621-3.05 CLEANUP. Remove from planting sites any quantities of subsoil, rock, and other spoils
 resulting from excavation after planting. Dispose of them as directed. On slopes 3:1 and steeper,
 you may scatter or dispose of material other than rock and coarse debris. Leave all planting sites
 in an acceptable condition.
 621-3.06 PLANT REPLACEMENTS. Before project completion, replace all trees, shrubs, crowns,
 and vines that are not alive and healthy with plants of the same species, size, and quality without
 extra compensation. Where replanting is performed, the Engineer may accept all plant material in
 a living, healthy condition, including replacements, at the time of final inspection.
 621-3.07 MAINTENANCE. Protect the planted areas using signs, barricades, or other approved
 means. Keep the planted areas watered.
 621-4.01 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. Section 109, by the number of plants or length of
 hedge alive and healthy at the time of final inspection.
 621-5.01 BASIS OF PAYMENT. Excavation, top soil, backfill, fertilization, and disposal of all
 unsuitable and surplus material are subsidiary.

 622-2.05 WELL SCREENS. Determine screen length, area, size of openings, and material after
 exploring water-bearing strata and analyzing samples from the strata. The Engineer will approve
 screen criteria depending on thickness and uniformity of water-bearing strata, analysis of aquifer
 samples, well requirements, and the screen manufacturer’s recommendations. Obtain
 representative samples of sands and water in the aquifer. Take the sand sample after obtaining a
 satisfactory yield according to Subsection 622-3.05. Submit the samples and a copy of the drilling
 log to the screen manufacturer. Give the Engineer copies of transmittals to and from the screen
 manufacturer.
 Use a final length of screen as recommended by the screen manufacturer and approved by the
 Engineer. Use the largest diameter that can be installed in the casing.
 Use a screen made of either silicon steel or stainless steel, based on chemical analysis of the
 well water. Screen must be strong enough to resist damage during installation and external force
 after installation. Do not change screen alignment after installation.
 Provide fittings of the same material as the screen needed to seal top of screen tightly to casing
 and to close bottom of screen. If screen is installed inside casing, provide a lead packer seal at
 top of screen with 12-inch minimum overlap of casing and screen. If screen is attached to casing,
 provide suitable coupling or weld screen to casing.

 shown on the Plans, to the length and width as directed. Place, level, and compact material to a
 firm surface using mechanical compaction.
 622-3.04 EXCAVATION. Make excavations for support posts, curbs, and screen fences large
 enough to allow working space for tamping backfill. Dispose of excess excavated material away
 from the rest area.
 622-3.05 CONSTRUCTING WATER WELL.
 1.
 
 General. Drill, develop, case, and test wells. Furnish and place all materials at the sites as
 detailed on the Plans. Procure all required permits, certificates, and licenses.
 Well depth shown on the Plans is approximate. The Department does not guarantee the
 presence of water at the anticipated depth. The exact depth will depend on adequate yield.
 
 2.
 
 Protection of Site. Protect all structures, trees, shrubbery, etc., during the work. Remove
 from the site all cuttings, drillings, debris, and unused materials. After completing the work,
 restore the site as nearly as possible to its original condition. Conduct water pumped from
 the well to a designated place where you can dispose of it without causing erosion or other
 damage to property or creating a nuisance.
 
 3.
 
 Bore and Casing. Drill the well straight, plumb, and large enough to receive the size of
 casing specified. Either weld or thread casing joints. Make the inside of the casing
 reasonably smooth and watertight.
 
 326
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 622
 
 4.
 
 Boring Log. Keep an accurate log of all materials encountered and the depths at which the
 changes in the formations occur, together with other information as required. Take samples
 of the materials found in each stratum at intervals of 5 feet or less. Preserve samples in
 your own receptacles. Mark the samples plainly to show the depth below the ground
 surface at which the sample was obtained. Include full, descriptive notes of everything
 found during drilling and of all difficulties or unusual conditions. Describe all waterbearing
 strata in detail. Indicate whether the material is loose or compact, what color it is, and, if the
 material is gravel, whether it is water-worn or angular. Note the presence of any clay. After
 completing the well, deliver one copy of the log and results of the yield test to the Engineer
 for transmittal to the State according to AS 41.08.
 
 5.
 
 Protecting Water Supply. Take all precautions as directed or necessary to prevent
 contaminated water, or water with undesirable physical or chemical characteristics, from
 entering the stratum from which the well will draw its supply through the opening you made.
 Take all necessary precautions during construction to prevent contaminated water,
 gasoline, etc., from entering the well through the opening or seeping through the ground
 surface.
 
 6.
 
 Corrective Work. If the well becomes contaminated, or if water with undesirable physical or
 chemical characteristics enters the well due to your neglect, perform corrective work at your
 expense. Supply casings, seals, sterilizing agents, or other necessary materials to
 eliminate the contamination or shut off the undesirable water.
 
 7.
 
 Temporary Capping. At all times during the work, protect the well to prevent tampering or
 contamination with foreign matter. After completing the well, provide and set a substantial
 screwed or flanged cap at least 12 inches but not more than 24 inches above the normal
 ground surface, or as directed.
 
 8.
 
 Developing and Testing.
 a.
 
 Yield Test. After completing the bore or as directed, bail or pump to determine the yield.
 The Engineer will determine the approximate level of water in the well before and
 immediately after you complete the yield test. The desired yield is 4 gallons per minute
 with a sustained yield of 25 gallons per hour.
 Furnish, install, and operate equipment of approved size and type for measuring the
 flow of water and depth to the water level in the well. Use a suitable flow measuring
 device such as a weir box, orifice, or water meter.
 If the yield test is unsuccessful, allow 10 working days for the State to evaluate the
 geologic and hydrologic well data and decide on another course of action.
 After receiving approval for a satisfactory yield test, but before developing the well, take
 a water sample and submit it to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
 for a bacteriological and chemical examination. Pay for all costs of samples and
 analysis.
 
 b.
 
 Developing. After completing drilling, develop and clean out the well. Develop the well
 with a suitable surge plunger or other device designed to develop wells in the
 waterbearing formation you encounter. Develop to give the maximum practical yield of
 water per foot of drawdown. Develop to extract from the water-bearing formation the
 practical maximum quantity of such fine materials that may, during the life of the well,
 be drawn into the casing when the well is pumped under maximum drawdown
 conditions. After completing developing, remove all sediment to the full depth of the
 well. Your equipment and material remain your property; remove them at the end of the
 work.

 10.
 
 Grouting.
 a.
 
 When the well is accepted, ream the upper 10 feet of the bore to a diameter at least 8
 inches greater than the casing OD. Center the casing in this section and hold it in place
 with enough spacers to maintain true alignment. Place grout in the area around the
 casing. Use grout consisting of 1 part portland cement and 3 parts sand mixed with
 only enough water to form a workable mix. Place the grout so that surface water and
 other impurities cannot infiltrate the well along the bore and casing. Use an approved
 grouting method. Force grout from the bottom of grout space toward the ground
 surface. Use a continuous grouting operation. Use continuous spacers of clean,
 durable material suitable for concrete aggregate.
 
 b.
 
 Allow the grout to set for 3 days before doing any work that may disturb it or cause it to
 crack. Take care to protect the grout from damage and ensure proper curing during the
 3-day setting period.
 
 Abandonment of Well.
 a.
 
 If water supply is not satisfactory, abandon the well. Plug the abandoned well bore with
 impervious material as required. Compensation for abandoning well bores and deleting
 other items of work necessary for completing the well and pump assembly will be made
 under Subsection 109-1.05.
 
 b.
 
 If you must abandon drilling at one location and begin drilling at another because of
 your operations, or if you fail to complete a satisfactory well bore as specified or
 required, plug the abandoned bore as specified. No compensation will be made for any
 work performed at the abandoned site. Salvaged materials remain your property.
 
 622-3.06 HAND PUMP ASSEMBLY. Install the well screen, drop pipe, pump rod, and cylinder as
 detailed on the Plans. Set the pump plumb on the casing. Furnish and install the hand pump and
 all required miscellaneous hardware not specified or detailed so that the water system will
 operate properly.
 On the basis of the yield test, the Engineer will stipulate the depth to the bottom of casing and the
 depth to which you must set the pump cylinder.
 Construct a concrete pump platform and drain as shown on the Plans.
 622-3.07 DISINFECTION. After completing the pump assembly, disinfect the well. Use the
 following amount for each 100 gallons of water in the well:
 Chlorinated Lime
 Chlorine Laundry Bleach
 HTH
 
 2.5 teaspoons
 1 pint
 12 tablespoons
 
 Mix the disinfectant with 5 gallons of water. Pour the disinfectant mixture into the well, down the
 sides of the casing and the drop pipe. Let the disinfectant stand overnight. Pump out the well until
 the water no longer tastes of chlorine.
 Obtain sample bottles from the State Department of Health and Social Services. Collect water
 samples and submit them to their Public Health Laboratory for testing. If the sample does not
 meet Public Health requirements, disinfect again and draw more samples until results are
 satisfactory.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 627-3.01 GENERAL. Complete the water system and make sure it operates properly at the time
 of acceptance of the work. Furnish and install all incidental parts not shown on the Plans or
 specified in this Section that are necessary to complete the water system.
 Meet the applicable provisions of Sections 201, 204, and 603 for all clearing and grubbing,
 excavation, bedding, backfill, conduit, and appurtenances.
 Consult the Plans for estimated locations of existing sewers, water mains, and other utilities near
 the construction. Use this data for information only. The Department does not guarantee their
 accuracy. Confirm and mark the exact locations of all existing utilities before starting work.
 Excavate, bore, or probe by hand ahead of your work where necessary to determine the exact
 location of underground conduit or other features that might interfere with construction. Support
 and protect conduits or other services that cross the trench. Immediately repair or replace any
 existing utilities that you break or damage. Immediately replace any existing valves, valve boxes,
 or water lines that you break or damage.
 Notify the local Fire Department at least 24 hours before removing or interrupting service to fire
 hydrants.
 Give at least 24 hours’ notice before interrupting water service to any area. Restore disrupted
 water service as soon as possible, or make temporary service connections. Use hoses or other
 suitable methods.
 If your operations cause service interruptions, you are responsible for all damages.
 Furnish and install concrete thrust blocks as shown on the Plans or specified in this Section.
 Place blocks against firm natural ground at the trench site. When the trench is in soft, unstable
 soil, remove the soft soil and replace it with a ballast backing large and heavy enough to resist
 the thrust.
 Connect to existing water lines and structures, avoiding contamination of water in lines that are in
 use.
 
 335
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 627
 
 Where water mains under this contract approach within 10 feet horizontal clearance and are
 below or less than 3 feet above existing sanitary sewers, encase the sanitary sewer with a jacket
 of Class W concrete 3 inches thick for 10 feet on each side of the crossings, as shown on the
 Plans.
 Concrete encasement is not required if the existing sewer is constructed of ductile iron pipe with
 joints at least 8 feet from the water main, or if you replace the existing sewer with such ductile
 iron pipe.
 627-3.02 INSTALLATION OF CONDUIT. Install conduit and fittings according to these
 Specifications or the manufacturer's recommendations. Lay conduit to the grades and lines
 shown on the Plans.
 Remove all foreign matter from conduit interiors before lowering conduit into the trench. When
 work is not in progress, securely close all open ends of conduit and fittings to keep out trench
 water, earth, rodents or other substances.
 Keep trenches dry to avoid laying conduit in water. Do not lay conduit when weather or trench
 conditions are unsuitable. Keep water away from new joints, until the joint materials have
 hardened.
 Use methods to cut conduit that will produce tight joints and will not damage the conduit.
 Inspect conduit before lowering it into the trench. Replace defective, damaged, or unsound
 conduit.
 Place conduit bedding to conform to plan details. Place bedding, if required, to give conduit a
 uniform bearing for its full length. Do not permit couplings to rest on solid or original trench
 bottoms.
 Conduit bends must not exceed the manufacturer’s recommended limits. If the specified or
 required alignment requires deflections beyond the limits, furnish special bends or enough shorter
 lengths of conduit to provide angular deflection within the limits.
 Use standard lengths of conduit except where fittings require short lengths, or where conduit
 passes through a rigid structure.
 Make service and other connections to conform to the Plans. Valve, plug or cap conduit ends for
 future connections as shown on the Plans and provide thrust blocks.
 627-3.03 FIRE HYDRANTS. Install, relocate, or adjust fire hydrants to the locations and grades
 shown on the Plans. Where required, furnish and install new fire hydrant extensions and any
 required conduit.
 Clean all foreign matter from inside hydrants before installation.
 Connect the hydrant to the main with 6-inch ductile iron conduit or the same size as the main,
 whichever is smaller. Provide with an auxiliary valve and cast iron valve box of the same size as
 the connecting conduit. Use a mechanical connection between the hydrant and the auxiliary
 valve.
 Set hydrants at elevations that drain the connecting conduit to the main. Set the hydrant on a slab
 of stone or concrete at least 4 inches thick and 15 inches square. Firmly block the back of the
 hydrant with concrete at least 1 square foot in area against the vertical face of the trench. If the
 character of the soil does not allow the hydrant to be securely wedged, use bridle rods and rod
 collars of at least 3/4 inch stock and coated with acid-resisting paint.
 
 336
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 627
 
 Place at least 7 cubic feet of approved broken stone or clean gravel around the base of the
 hydrant to ensure drainage. Thoroughly compact the backfill around hydrant to the grade line in a
 satisfactory manner.
 Tighten stuffing boxes and inspect the hydrants in opened and closed positions to make sure that
 all parts are in working condition.
 When removing a fire hydrant from an existing main, plug the tee in the main and test for leakage
 according to Subsection 627-3.06.
 Adjust existing fire hydrants for grade, using barrel extensions according to the hydrant
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 627-3.04 VALVES. Install gate valves as shown on the Plans, on a firm base, and plumb.
 Remove all foreign matter from the interior before installation.
 627-3.05 VALVE BOXES. Install valve boxes over the gate valves as shown on the Plans. Center
 box over valve and rest base section on well-compacted backfill. Set top section to allow equal
 movement above and below finished grade, with final elevation 1 inch below finished grade. Set
 top of base section approximately on line with nut at top of valve stem. The entire assembly must
 be plumb.
 Place a concrete collar on valve boxes installed in pavement, as shown on the Plans.
 Adjust existing valve boxes by raising or lowering to conform to the final grade and the details
 shown on the Plans. Salvage and reuse the existing cast iron valve box and cover. If the valve
 box is adjustable, adjust it with adaptable extension pieces. If the valve box is constructed with
 steel conduit, weld additional steel conduit to raise the cover. Lower by cutting the existing valve
 box pipe.
 627-3.06 TESTING WATER SYSTEM. Test all water main and service connection work for both
 pressure and leakage after laying. Leave conduit joints fully exposed. Place only enough backfill
 between joints to hold the conduit in place during testing. Test services before insulation. Open
 corporation stops after successful tests. Conduct all tests with the Engineer present.
 Furnish all testing equipment, labor, materials, and supplies. The Engineer has the right to test
 and approve all gauges used.
 Where connection is made to an existing main with no valve present, blank off or plug the outlet
 leading to the existing main before testing.
 Conduct tests after completing installation of the system or any portion thereof, before backfilling
 and after thoroughly flushing the test portion. Fill all lines with water and eliminate all air.
 Use test pressure equal to the strength classification of the pipe. Use either pneumatic or
 hydraulic pressure. Maintain pressure on the tested portion for at least 2 hours. Allowable
 leakage during the test must not exceed the amount established by the AWWA. If visible leakage
 other than minor sweating occurs, immediately stop the test and tighten the joint to eliminate
 leakage when pressure is resumed. Replace leaking fittings, nipples, or lengths of conduit. Do not
 caulk or use paints, asphalts, enamels or other types of compounds to eliminate leaks.
 Complete backfilling after acceptance of the tests.
 627-3.07 DISINFECTION. After acceptance of pressure and leakage tests, disinfect all portions of
 the water system, including valves and stops and any portion of the existing connecting system
 that may have been contaminated during construction.

 SECTION 627
 
 Use calcium hypochlorite as the disinfecting medium. Use “HTH,” Perchloron, or a similar
 commercial product with approximately 70 percent available chlorine. Make a 5 percent solution
 by mixing 5 percent of powder with 95 percent water (by weight). Mix the solution into a paste,
 thin it to slurry by adding water, and add it to the system. Place enough disinfecting material in
 the system to ensure a chlorine dosage of 50 ppm. This dosage is equivalent to 10 ounces of
 commercial hypochlorite powder to each 1,000 gallons of water.
 After adding the chlorine solution, open and leave open all taps, valves, etc., until you notice a
 strong chlorine odor in the water coming from the outlets; then close the taps, valves, etc. Keep
 chlorinated water in the system for at least 24 hours; then thoroughly flush the system. During the
 retention period, operate all valves, stops, and other appurtenances to assist disinfection.
 After treating the system, thoroughly flush. Then take samples from representative points in the
 system. Place samples in sterile bottles and submit them to proper authorities as directed for
 bacteriological examination. If the bacteriological examination report is unsatisfactory, repeat
 disinfection until you obtain satisfactory results.

 c.
 
 As identified in the SWPPP.
 
 Land may be disturbed and stabilized multiple times during a project. Coordinate work to
 minimize the amount of disturbed soil at any one time. Do not disturb more soil than you can
 stabilize with the resources available.
 Temporarily stabilize from wind and water erosion portions of disturbed soils, portions of
 stockpiles, and portions of disposal sites, that are not in active construction. Temporary
 stabilization measures may require a combination of measures including but not limited to
 vegetative cover, mulch, stabilizing emulsions, blankets, mats, soil binders, non-erodible
 cover, dust palliatives, or other approved methods.
 When temporary or permanent seeding is required, provide a working hydro seeding
 equipment located within 100 miles of the project by road; with 1,000 gallon or more tank
 capacity, paddle agitation of tank, and the capability to reach the seed areas with an uniform
 mixture of water, seed, mulch and tackifier. If the project is located in an isolated community
 the hydro-seeder must be located at the project.
 Before applying temporary or permanent seeding, prepare the surface to be seeded to
 reduce erosion potential and to facilitate germination and growth of vegetative cover. Apply
 seed and maintain seeded areas. Reseed areas where growth of temporary vegetative cover
 is inadequate to stabilize disturbed ground.
 Apply permanent seed according to Sections 618 and 724, within the time periods allowed by
 the CGP and the contract, at locations where seeding is indicated on the plans and after
 land-disturbing activity is permanently ceased.
 When installing a culvert or other drainage structure where stream bypass is not used, install
 temporary or final stabilization concurrently or immediately after placing the culvert or
 drainage structure in a manner that complies with the SWPPP, applicable project permits and
 prevents discharge of pollutants. Install temporary or final stabilization:
 
 368
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 641
 
 d. At the culvert or drainage structure inlet and outlet; and
 e. In the areas upstream and downstream that may be disturbed by the process of installing
 the culvert, culvert end walls, culvert end sections, or drainage structure.
 Before deactivating a stream bypass or stream diversion used for construction of a bridge,
 culvert, or drainage structure, install final or temporary stabilization when approved by the
 Engineer:
 f.
 
 At the inlet and outlet of the culvert, drainage structure, or bridge;
 
 g. In the area upstream and downstream of the culvert, drainage structure, or bridge, that is
 disturbed during installation or construction of the culvert, drainage structure, or bridge;
 and
 h. Under the bridge.
 Within fourteen days of initiating final stabilization, either complete final stabilization or
 continue maintenance of work until final stabilization is complete.
 6. Ending CGP Coverage and BMP Maintenance in the Project Zone.
 The Engineer will determine the date that all the following conditions for ending CGP
 coverage have been met within the Project Zone:
 a. Land disturbing activities have ceased;
 b. Final Stabilization has been achieved on all portions of the Project Zone, according to the
 CGP PART 4.5.2 (including at Department furnished material sources, disposal sites,
 staging areas, equipment areas, etc.); and
 c.
 
 Temporary BMPs have been removed.
 
 After the Engineer has determined the conditions for ending CGP coverage have been met,
 the Department will:
 d. Send written notice to the Contractor with the date that the conditions were met;
 e. Submit an eNOT to DEC; and
 f.
 
 Provide a copy of the eNOT and DEC’s acknowledgement letter to the Contractor.
 
 The Contractor is responsible for ending permit coverage within the Project Zone, by
 submitting an eNOT to DEC within 30 days of meeting the conditions for ending CGP
 coverage. The Contractor is responsible for BMP maintenance and SWPPP updates until
 permit coverage is ended.
 If the Contractor’s CGP eNOI acreage includes Support Activities and any other areas where
 the Department is not an Operator, the Contractor may not be able to file an eNOT at the
 same time as the Department. In this case, the Contractor must amend the SWPPP and
 separate SWPPP2(s), to indicate the Department’s CGP coverage has ended, and the
 Department is no longer an Operator within the Project Zone.
 The Contractor must indicate in the SWPPP the areas that have reached Final Stabilization,
 and the dates land disturbing activities ended and Final Stabilization was achieved. The
 Contractor must submit an eNOT to DEC, and insert copies of the Department’s and the
 Contractor’s eNOTs with DEC’s acknowledgement letters in the appendix of the SWPPP.
 
 369
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 641
 
 The Contractor must submit a copy of each signed eNOT and DEC’s acknowledgement letter
 to the Department within three days of filing the eNOT or receiving a written response.
 The Contractor is responsible for coordinating local government inspections of work and
 ending permit coverage with local government. See Subsection 641-1.03.5 for more
 information.
 7. Transmit final SWPPP.
 Transmit one copy of the final SWPPP, including all amendments, appendices and maps, to
 the Engineer; when the project eNOTs are filed, or within 30 days of the Department’s eNOT
 being filed, whichever is sooner. Transmittal must be by both electronic and hard copy.
 641-3.02 SWPPP DOCUMENTS, LOCATION ON-SITE, AVAILABILITY, AND RECORD
 RETENTION.
 The SWPPP and related documents maintained by the Contractor are the Record for
 demonstrating compliance with the CGP. Copies of SWPPP documents transmitted to the
 Engineer under the requirements of this specification are informational and do not relieve the
 Contractor’s responsibility to maintain complete records as required by the CGP and this
 specification.
 Keep the SWPPP, HMCP and SPCC Plan at the on-site project office. If there is not an on-site
 project office, keep the documents at a locally available location that meets CGP requirements
 and is approved by the Engineer. Records may be moved to another office for record retention
 after the eNOTs are filed. Records may be moved to another office during winter shutdown.
 Update on-site postings if records are relocated during winter shutdown. Provide the Department
 with copies of all Records.
 Retain Records and a copy of the SWPPP, for at least three years after the date of eNOT. If EPA
 or DEC inspects the project, issues a Notice of Violation (NOV), or begins investigation for a
 potential NOV before the retention period expires, retain the SWPPP and all Records related to
 the SWPPP and CGP until at least three years after EPA and/or DEC has determined all issues
 related to the investigation are settled.
 The SWPPP and related documents must be made available for review and copy, to the
 Department and other regulatory agencies that request them. See CGP Parts 5.10, 6.6 and 9.5.
 641-3.03 SWPPP INSPECTIONS, AMENDMENTS, REPORTS, AND LOGS.
 Perform Inspections, prepare Inspection Reports, and prepare SWPPP Amendments in
 compliance with the SWPPP and the CGP. Update SWPPP Corrective Action Log Form 25D112, SWPPP Amendment Log Form 25D-114, SWPPP Grading and Stabilization Activities Log
 Form 25D-110, SWPPP Project Staff Tracking Form 25D-127, and SWPPP Daily Record of
 Rainfall Form 25D-115. For active projects update the Records daily.
 1. Inspection during Construction.
 Conduct Inspections according to the schedule and requirements of the SWPPP and CGP.
 Inspections required by the CGP and SWPPP must be performed by the Contractor’s
 SWPPP Manager and the Department’s Stormwater Inspector jointly, unless approved by the
 Engineer, when:
 a. One of the inspectors is not on site, access is only by air, and weather delayed or
 canceled flights;
 b. One of the inspectors is sick;
 
 370
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 641
 
 c.
 
 The project is on a reduced frequency inspection schedule with no staff on site, the only
 access to the site is by air, and it is economical to send only on inspector; or
 d. When the Engineer determines a safety concern which makes joint inspection
 impracticable.
 When this is the case, the Operator who conducts the Inspection must provide a copy of the
 Inspection Report to the other Operator within three days of the Inspection date and
 document the date of the report transmittal.
 
 2. Inspection Reports.
 Use only the DOT&PF SWPPP Construction Site Inspection Report, Form 25D-100 to record
 Inspections. Changes or revisions to Form 25D-100 are not permitted; except for adding or
 deleting data fields that list: Location of Discharge Points, and Site Specific BMPs. Complete
 all fields included on the Inspection Report form; do not leave any field blank.
 Insert a Complete-by-Date for each corrective action listed that complies with Section 6413.01 (4) and the CGP
 Provide a copy of the completed, unsigned Inspection Report to the Engineer by the end of
 the next business day following the inspection.
 The Superintendent must review, correct errors, and sign and certify the Inspection Report,
 within three days of the date of Inspection. The Engineer may coordinate with the
 Superintendent to review and correct any errors or omissions before the Superintendent
 signs the report. Corrections are limited to adding missing information or correcting entries to
 match field notes and conditions present at the time the Inspection was performed. Deliver
 the signed and certified Inspection Report to the Engineer on the same day the
 Superintendent signs it.
 The Engineer will sign and certify the Inspection Report and will return the original to the
 Contractor within three working days.
 The Engineer may make corrections after the Superintendent has signed and certified the
 Inspection Report. The Engineer will initial and date each correction. If the Engineer makes
 corrections, the Superintendent must recertify the Inspection Report by entering a new
 signature and date in the white space below the original signature and date lines. Send a
 copy of the recertified Inspection Report to the Engineer on the day it is recertified.
 If subsequent corrections to the certified Inspection Report are needed, document the
 corrections in an amendment memo that addresses only the omitted or erroneous portions of
 the original Inspection Report. The Superintendent and the Engineer must both sign and
 certify the amendment memo. The issuance of an amendment memo does not relieve the
 Contractor of liquidated damages that may have been incurred as a result of the error on the
 original certified inspection report.
 3. Inspection before Seasonal Suspension of Work.
 Conduct an Inspection before seasonal suspension of work to confirm BMPs are installed
 and functioning according to the requirements of the SWPPP and CGP.
 4. Reduced Inspection Frequencies.
 Conduct Inspections according to the inspection schedule indicated in the approved SWPPP.
 Any change in inspection frequency must be approved by the Engineer, and beginning and
 ending dates documented as an amendment to the SWPPP.
 
 371
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 641
 
 If the Engineer approves and the entire site is stabilized, the frequency of inspections may be
 reduced to at least one inspection every 30 days. At actively staffed sites, inspect within two
 business days of the end of a storm event that results in a discharge from the site.
 When work is suspended due to fall freeze-up, the Engineer may suspend inspection
 requirements after fourteen days of freezing conditions if:
 a. Soil disturbing activities are suspended; and
 b. Soil stabilizing activities are suspended.
 Inspections must resume according to the normal inspection schedule identified in the
 SWPPP, at least 21 days before anticipated spring thaw. See CGP Part 6.2.3.
 The Engineer may waive requirements for updating the Grading and Stabilization Activities
 Log and Daily Record of Rainfall during seasonal suspension of work. If so, resume
 collecting and recording weather data on the Daily Record of Rainfall form one month before
 thawing conditions are expected to result in runoff. Resume recording land disturbance and
 stabilization activities on the Grading and Stabilization Activities Log when Construction
 Activity resumes.
 5. Stabilization before Seasonal Thaw.
 Construction Activities within the Project Zone must be stabilized with appropriate BMPs prior
 to spring thaw, as defined in the CGP.
 6. Inspection before Project Completion.
 Conduct Inspection to ensure Final Stabilization is complete throughout the Project, and
 temporary BMPs that are required to be removed are removed. Temporary BMPs that are
 biodegradable and are specifically designed and installed with the intent of remaining in place
 until they degrade, may remain in place after project completion.
 7. Items and Areas to Inspect.
 Conduct Inspections of the areas required by the CGP and SWPPP.
 8. SWPPP Amendments and SWPPP Amendment Log.
 The Superintendent and the SWPPP Manager are the only persons authorized to amend the
 SWPPP and update the SWPPP Amendment Log, Form 25D-114. The Superintendent or the
 SWPPP Manager must sign and date amendments to the SWPPP and updates to the
 SWPPP Amendment Log.
 SWPPP Amendments must be approved by the Engineer.
 Amendments must occur:
 a. Whenever there is a change in design, construction operation, or maintenance at the
 construction site that has or could cause erosion, sedimentation or the discharge of
 pollutants that has not been previously addressed in the SWPPP;
 b. If an Inspection identifies that any portion of the SWPPP is ineffective in preventing
 erosion, sedimentation, or the discharge of pollutants;
 c.
 
 Whenever an Inspection identifies a problem that requires additional or modified BMPs
 
 372
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 641
 
 d. Whenever a BMP is modified during construction, or a BMP not shown in the original
 SWPPP is added;
 e. If the Inspection frequency is modified (note beginning and ending dates); or
 f.
 
 When there is a change in personnel who are named in the SWPPP, according to
 Subsection 641-2.01.4.
 
 Amend the SWPPP narrative as soon as practicable after any change or modification, but in
 no case, later than seven days following identification of the need for an amendment. Every
 SWPPP Amendment must be signed and dated. Cross-reference the amendment number
 with the Corrective Action Log or SWPPP page number, as applicable. When a BMP is
 modified or added, describe the BMP according to Subsection 641-2.01.3.
 Keep the SWPPP Amendment Log current. Prior to performing each scheduled Inspection,
 submit to the Engineer a copy of the pages of the Amendment Log that contain new entries
 since the last submittal. Include copies of any documents amending the SWPPP.
 Keep the SWPPP Amendment Log as an appendix to the SWPPP.
 9. Site Maps.

 on the SWPPP Corrective Action Log, Form 25D-112. Document the need for corrective
 action within 24 hours of either:
 a. Identification during an inspection; or
 b. Discovery by the Department’s or Contractor’s staff, a subcontractor, or a regulatory
 agency inspector.
 Modification or replacement of a BMP, installation of a new BMP not shown in the original
 SWPPP, overdue BMP maintenance, or other reasons listed as corrective actions in 6413.01.4 must be documented on the Corrective Action Log.
 Within 24 hours of discovery, update the Corrective Action Log, Form 25D-112, with the date
 of discovery and proposed corrective action. If discovered during an inspection, update log
 with inspection date and proposed corrective actions noted on the Inspection Report. If
 discovered outside of an inspection, update the log with the date of discovery, the proposed
 corrective action, and the date the corrective action was completed.
 After the corrective action has been accomplished, note in the Corrective Action Log the
 action taken and if a SWPPP amendment was needed. Date and initial the entry.
 Keep the Corrective Action Log current and submit a copy to the Engineer prior to performing
 each scheduled SWPPP Inspection.

 643-3.01 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Keep the work, and portions of the
 project affected by the work, in good condition to accommodate traffic safely. Provide and
 maintain traffic control devices and services inside and outside the project limits, day and night, to
 guide traffic safely.
 Unless otherwise provided in this Section, keep all roadways, business accesses, and pedestrian
 facilities within the project limits open to traffic. Obtain the Engineer’s approval before temporarily
 closing residential, commercial, or street approaches. Provide access through the project for
 emergency vehicles and school and transit buses. Properly sign and/or flag all locations where
 the traveling public is redirected or stopped. Organize construction operations so the total of all
 
 391
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 643
 
 construction related stoppages experienced by a vehicle traveling through the project does not
 exceed 20 minutes except when indicated otherwise in the Contract.
 Stop equipment at all points of intersection with the traveling public unless an approved TCP
 shows otherwise.
 Continue to operate all illumination and signalization according to the requirements of Subsection
 660-3.09. When moving approach lanes, realign signal heads as necessary according to the
 ATM. Coordinate any modifications to existing traffic signals with the agency that maintains and
 operates them. Operate flood lighting at night according to the ATM. Adjust flood lighting so that it
 does not shine into oncoming traffic.
 Provide and maintain safe routes for pedestrians and bicyclists through or around traffic control
 zones at all times, except when regulations prohibit pedestrians or bicyclists.
 Immediately notify the Engineer of any traffic related accident that occurs within the project limits
 as soon as an employee, or a subcontractor becomes aware of the accident.
 643-3.02 ROADWAY CHARACTERISTICS DURING CONSTRUCTION. Obtain an approved
 TCP before reducing existing roadway lane and shoulder widths and before starting construction.
 Maintain a clear area with at least 2 feet between the edge of traveled way and the work area.
 Use barricades, traffic cones, or drums to delineate this area. Place traffic control devices on the
 work side of the clear area. Space them according to the ATM.
 If maintaining traffic on an unpaved surface, provide a smooth and even surface that public traffic
 can use at all times. Properly crown the roadbed surface for drainage. Before beginning other
 grading operations, place sufficient fill at culverts and bridges to permit traffic to cross smoothly
 and unimpeded. Use part-width construction techniques when routing traffic through roadway
 cuts or over embankments under construction. Excavate the material or place it in layers.
 Alternate construction activities from one side to the other. Route traffic over the side opposite the
 one under construction.
 Detour traffic when the Plans or an approved TCP allows. Maintain detour routes so that traffic
 can proceed safely. When detours are no longer required, obliterate the detour. Topsoil and seed
 appropriate areas.
 If two-way traffic cannot be maintained on the existing roadway or detour, you may use half-width
 construction or a road closure if it is shown on an approved TCP. Make sure the TCP indicates
 closure duration and conditions. Schedule roadway closures so you do not delay school buses or
 peak-hour traffic. For road closures, post closure-start and road-reopen times at the closure site,
 within view of waiting traffic.
 643-3.03 PUBLIC NOTICE. Give notice at least 3 days before major changes, delays, lane
 restrictions, or road closures to local officials and transportation organizations, including but not
 necessarily limited to:

 Provide local traffic enforcement and maintenance agencies 24 hour notice before shutting down
 a traffic signal system. Provide notice as required by utility companies before repairing or
 replacing a utility.
 Provide the Alaska State Troopers, local police and fire department with the radio frequencies
 used on the project and the 24-hour telephone numbers of the Worksite Traffic Supervisor and
 the Project Superintendent. These telephone numbers are used to alert construction employees
 when emergency vehicles must pass through the project. When notified of emergencies make
 every necessary effort to expedite rapid passage.
 Additional notices may be given through the Navigator or 511 System for selected projects.
 Check the special provisions for those requirements.
 643-3.04 TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES. Before starting construction, erect permanent and
 temporary traffic control devices required by the approved TCPs. The Engineer will determine
 advisory speeds when necessary.
 For lane closures on multilane roadways, use sequential arrow panels. During hours of darkness
 when required by the approved TCP use flashing warning lights to mark obstructions or hazards
 and steady-burn lights for channelization.
 Use only one type of traffic control device in a continuous line of delineating devices, unless
 otherwise noted on an approved TCP. Use drums or Type II barricades for lane drop tapers.
 During non-working hours and after completing a particular construction operation, remove all
 unnecessary traffic control devices. Store all unused traffic control devices in a designated
 storage area which does not present a nuisance or visual distraction to traffic. If sign panels are
 post mounted and cannot be readily removed, cover them entirely with either metal or plywood
 sheeting. Completely cover signal heads with durable material that that fully blocks the view of
 signal head and will not be damaged or removed by weather.
 Keep signs, drums, barricades, and other devices clean at all times.
 Use only traffic control devices that meet the requirements of the “Acceptable” category in ATSSA
 (American Traffic Safety Services Association) “Quality Guidelines for Temporary Traffic Control
 Devices” and meet crashworthiness requirements per Section 643-2.02.
 Immediately replace any devices provided under this Section that are lost, stolen, destroyed,
 inoperable or deemed unacceptable while used on the project. Stock repair parts for each
 Temporary Crash Cushion used on the project. Repair damaged crash cushions within 24 hours.
 Maintain pre-existing roadside safety hardware at an equivalent or better level than existed prior
 to project implementation until the progress of construction necessitates removing the hardware.
 All existing hazards that are currently protected with roadside safety hardware or new hazards
 which result from project improvements shall be protected or delineated as required in the plans,
 specifications, and approved TCPs until permanent roadside safety hardware is installed. All
 temporary roadside safety hardware shall meet NCHRP 350 or MASH Test Level 3 unless
 otherwise noted.
 All items paid under this Section remain the property of the Contractor, unless noted otherwise in
 the contract. Remove them after completing the project.
 1. Embankments. Install portable concrete or steel barrier, plastic drums, barricades, tubular
 markers, plastic safety fence, and cones as specified on the Plans or TCPs to delineate open
 
 393
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 643
 
 trenches, ditches, other excavations and hazardous areas when they exist along the roadway
 for more than one continuous work shift.
 2. Adjacent Travel Lane Paving. When paving lifts are 2 inches or greater and you cannot finish
 paving adjacent travel lanes or paved shoulders to the same elevation before the end of the
 paving shift, install: W8-11 (Uneven Lanes), W8-9 (Low Shoulder), W8-17 (Shoulder DropOff), W14-3 (No Passing Zone), R4-1 (Do Not Pass), R4-2 (Pass with Care), and W8-1
 (Bump) signs as appropriate. Place additional signs every 1500 feet if the section is longer
 than 1/2 mile.
 3. Fixed Objects And Construction Vehicles And Equipment Working On Or Next To The
 Traveled Way. Do not park equipment in medians. Locate fixed objects at least 30 feet from
 the edge of traveled way. Fixed objects that exist prior to construction activity are not subject
 to this requirement unless the proposed temporary traffic routing moves the edge of traveled
 way closer to the pre-existing fixed object. Vehicles and other objects within parking lots in
 urban environments are considered preexisting fixed objects regardless of whether they are
 or are not present continuously throughout the day.
 When worksite restrictions, land features, right of way limitations, environmental restrictions,
 construction phasing, or other construction conditions allow no practicable location meeting
 the preceding requirements, the Engineer may approve alternate locations for fixed objects.
 Alternate locations shall be as far as practicable from the edge of traveled way. When the
 alternate location provides 15 feet or more separation from the edge of traveled way, the
 Engineer may verbally approve the alternate location. When the alternate location provides
 less than 15 feet separation, written approval is required.
 When the Engineer determines a fixed object or fixed objects present unacceptable hazard,
 use drums or Type II barricades with flashing warning lights, or use portable concrete or steel
 barriers, or temporary crash cushion to delineate or shield the hazard, as approved by the
 Engineer.
 4. Flagging. Furnish trained and competent flaggers and all necessary equipment, including
 lighting of the flagging position during nighttime operations, to control traffic through the traffic
 control zone. The Engineer will approve each flagging operation before it begins and direct
 adjustments as conditions change.
 Flaggers must be certified as one of the following:
 a. Flagging Level I Certification by IMSA
 b. Flagger Certification by ATSSA
 c.
 
 Traffic Control Supervisor, ATSSA
 
 d. Work Zone Safety Specialist, IMSA
 e. ATSSA Flagging Instructor
 Flaggers shall maintain current flagger certification. Flaggers must be able to show their
 flagger certification anytime they are on the project.
 Flaggers must maintain their assigned flagging location at all times, unless another qualified
 flagger relieves them, or the approved traffic control plan terminates the flagging
 requirements. Remove, fully cover, or lay down flagger signs when no flagger is present.
 Keep the flaggers’ area free of encumbrances. Keep the flagger’s vehicle well off the
 roadway and away from the flagging location so the flagger can be easily seen.
 
 394
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 643
 
 Provide approved equipment for two-way radio communications between flaggers when
 flaggers are not in plain, unobstructed view of each other.
 Obtain the Engineer’s written approval before flagging signalized intersections. When
 flagging a signalized intersection, either turn off and cover the traffic signal or place it in the
 All-Red Flash mode. Coordinate changing traffic signal modes and turning off or turning on
 traffic signals with the agency responsible for signal maintenance and operation and the
 Engineer. Get their written approval in advance. Only uniformed police officers are permitted
 to direct traffic in an intersection with an operating traffic signal.
 5. Pilot Cars. You may use pilot cars when part of an approved TCP, if the Engineer determines
 one-way traffic is necessary, or if the route through the traffic control zone is particularly
 hazardous, involved, or frequently altered to preclude adequate signing, Do not use pilot
 cars to avoid localized traffic control at several locations. Pilot car operators may not control
 Automated Flagger Assistance Devices while operating a pilot car.
 Organize construction operations so the total of all stoppages experienced by a vehicle
 traveling through a project does not exceed 20 minutes. However, this does not imply that
 you may allow 20 minutes in all cases. Coordinate multiple pilot-car operations within a
 project or adjoining projects to minimize inconvenience to the traveling public. Two or more
 pilot cars may be used to provide two-way traffic through the traffic control zone to reduce the
 waiting period. The flagger or pilot car operator must record each pilot car’s departure time in
 a bound field book furnished by the Engineer. Whenever practical, the flagger should tell the
 motorist the reason for and approximate length of the delay. Make every reasonable effort to
 yield right-of-way to the public and prevent excessive delay.
 Use an automobile or pickup as the pilot car, with the company logo prominently displayed.
 Equip the pilot car with a two-way radio for contact with flaggers and other pilot cars. Mount a
 G20-4 sign (Pilot Car Follow Me) on the rear at least 5 feet above the driving surface. Use
 high intensity flashing strobe lights, oscillating beacons, or rotating beacons on all Pilot Cars.
 Vehicle hazard warning lights may supplement but are not permitted to be used instead of
 high intensity flashing strobe lights, oscillating beacons, or rotating beacons. Identify the last
 vehicle in the column.
 When pilot car operations are approved, establish all required pilot car traffic control devices
 before beginning work. Continue pilot car operations until no longer necessary and an
 approved TCP is in place for operations without pilot car, including all required traffic control
 devices.
 6. Street Sweeping. Use a street sweeper that collects material to keep the project and affected
 areas free of loose material. Include paved portions of the roadway within project limits, haul
 routes open to the public, and sections of roadway outside of project limits where your
 operations have deposited loose material.
 7. Watering. Furnish, haul, and place water for dust control and pavement flushing, as directed.
 Use water trucks that can provide a high-pressure water stream to flush the pavement and a
 light-water spray to control dust. If the flushing operations contaminate or fill adjacent catch
 basins, clean and restore them to their original condition. This requirement includes sections
 of roadway off the project where flushing is required. The Engineer will control water
 application.
 Obtain an Alaska Department of Natural Resources permit for water removal before taking
 water from a lake, stream, or other natural water body. Comply with the Alaska Department of
 Fish and Game screening requirements for all water removal operations.
 
 395
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 643
 
 8. Portable Changeable Message Board Signs. Furnish Changeable Message Signs when
 approved on a TCP. Display only messages approved on the TCP. Follow application
 guidelines in the ATM.
 9. Truck Mounted Attenuator (TMA.) TMAs are mounted on the rear of work vehicles. Impact
 attenuators are defined by NCHRP 350 or MASH as a category 3 device. TMAs shall be
 mounted on a vehicle with a minimum weight of 15,000 pounds and a maximum weight in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. TMAs shall have an adjustable height
 so that it can be placed at the correct elevation during usage and to a safe height for
 transporting. Approach ends of TMAs shall have impact attenuator markings in accordance
 with the ATM. Do not use a damaged attenuator in the work. Replace any damaged TMA at
 your expense.
 10. Traffic Control Vehicles. Use high intensity flashing strobe lights, oscillating beacons, or
 rotating beacons on the Work Zone Supervisor’s vehicle and on vehicles being used to
 transport and set-up traffic control devices. Vehicle hazard warning lights may supplement
 but are not permitted to be used instead of high intensity flashing strobe lights, oscillating
 beacons, or rotating beacons.
 643-3.05 AUTHORITY OF THE ENGINEER. The Engineer will provide written notice when
 conditions may adversely affect the traveling public’s safety and/or convenience. The notice will
 state the defect(s), the corrective action(s) required, and the time required to complete the
 corrective action(s). If corrective action(s) are not completed within the specified time, the
 Engineer may immediately suspend work on the offending operations until the defect(s) are
 corrected. The Engineer may require outside forces to correct unsafe conditions. The cost of work
 by outside forces will be deducted from any monies due under the terms of this Contract.
 643-3.06 TRAFFIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT. A Traffic Price Adjustment, under Item 643(23), will
 be assessed for unauthorized lane closures or reductions. Unauthorized lane reductions will be
 assessed as one full lane closure, for each lane reduced without authorization
 Authorized lane closures and/or lane reductions are those shown in the Contract, an approved
 TCP, or authorized in writing.
 Unauthorized lane reductions include unacceptable roadway, pedestrian walkway or route, and
 bicycle route or pathway surfaces, such as severe bumps, ruts, washboarding, potholes,
 excessive dust or mud, and non-conforming or out of place traffic control devices. Failure to
 install temporary crash cushions or barriers, when required according to the Contract or TCP, is
 also considered an unauthorized lane reduction. The Engineer will make the sole determination
 whether unauthorized lane reductions or closures are present.
 Adjustment Rates are listed in Table 643-3. These rates are liquidated damages which represent
 highway user costs, based on Average Daily Traffic (ADT). The Engineer will use the rate shown
 for the current ADT for this project, as published in the Regional Traffic Volume Report prepared
 by the Department's Planning Section. Adjustment rates for unauthorized reduction or closure of
 each lane of pedestrian walkways or route, and bicycle route or pathway, are the same as for one
 full roadway lane closure.

 643-3.07 MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC DURING SUSPENSION OF WORK. Approximately one
 month before work is suspended for the season, schedule a preliminary meeting with the
 Engineer and Maintenance & Operations to outline the anticipated roadway condition and the
 work expected to be completed before shutdown. Schedule a field review with the Department for
 winter maintenance acceptance. At the field review the Engineer will prepare a punch list for
 implementation before acceptance.
 To be relieved of winter maintenance responsibility, leave all roads with a smooth and even
 surface for public use at all times. Properly crown the roadbed surface for drainage and install
 adequate safety facilities. Make sure all illumination and signals, including vehicle detectors, are
 in good working order.
 After the project is accepted for winter maintenance and until you are ordered to resume
 construction operations, the Department is responsible for maintaining the facility. The
 Department will accept maintenance responsibility only for portions of the work that are open to
 the public, as determined by the Engineer. The Department will not accept maintenance
 responsibility for incomplete work adjacent to accepted roads. You are responsible for
 maintaining all other portions of the work. The Engineer will issue a letter of “Acceptance for
 Winter Maintenance” that lists all portions of the work that the Department will maintain during a
 seasonal work suspension. You retain all contractually required maintenance responsibilities until
 receipt of this letter.
 If you suspend work due to unfavorable weather (other than seasonal) or due to your failure to
 correct unsafe conditions, carry out Contract provisions, or carry out the Engineer’s orders, you
 must bear all costs for traffic maintenance during the suspended period.
 When you resume work, replace or renew any work or materials lost or damaged during
 temporary use. If the Department caused damage during winter suspension, payment will be
 made for repairs by unit pay item or in accord with Subsection 109-1.05, Compensation for Extra
 Work. When the Engineer directs, remove any work or materials used in the temporary
 maintenance. Complete the project as though work has been continuous.
 643-3.08 CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCING. The construction sequencing detailed in these
 provisions, the Special Provisions, and the Plans is suggested only. You may propose alternative
 construction sequencing.
 Throughout the project, maintain the existing roadway, pedestrian walkway or route, and bicycle
 route or pathway configuration (such as the number of lanes and their respective widths) except
 for restrictions to traffic allowed in the Special Provisions or on the Plans, and addressed through
 approved TCPs. A restriction to traffic is any roadway surface condition, work operation, or traffic
 control setup that reduces the number of lanes or impedes traffic. Obtain an approved TCP
 before restricting traffic.
 Do not restrict traffic or shut down signals during the times listed in the Special Provisions.
 
 397
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 643
 
 643-3.09 INTERIM PAVEMENT MARKINGS. Place permanent or interim pavement markings
 according to this Subsection, details shown on the Plans, approved TCPs, and Parts III and VI of
 the ATM before opening existing paved roadways, temporary paved roadways, detours, interim
 paving lifts, and roadways with seal coats and surface treatments for more than one continuous
 work shift. This work may include restriping the existing roadway before beginning construction,
 before seasonal suspension, and/or after seasonal suspension.
 Remove conflicting pavement markings according to Subsection 670-3.04, Paint Removal.
 Pavement markings that are temporarily conflicting (markings that will be restored when
 construction is complete) may be removed according to Subsection 670-3.04 or covered with
 black removable preformed marking tape.
 Mark existing roadway sections that will be opened to traffic during the winter. Mark over the
 existing lines and markings, unless shown otherwise on the Plans or an approved TCP.
 Maintain all interim pavement markings for their intended life including reapplication when
 necessary. There will be no compensation to upgrade interim pavement markings required for
 work operations lasting up to 2 weeks.
 Use only temporary raised pavement markers or removable preformed retroreflective marking
 tape as interim pavement markings on final pavement surfaces. Completely remove and dispose
 of them when placing the final markings. Completely remove any residual adhesive that might
 misguide motorists. Place final pavement markings on finished pavement surfaces and interim
 pavement surfaces before suspending work for the winter.
 Stage construction to avoid routing traffic over conflicting markings for more than one continuous
 workshift. If traffic is routed over conflicting markings during a work shift, delineate the roadway
 with a complement of warning signs, channelizing devices, and flaggers as required by the ATM.
 Use only temporary raised pavement markers meeting Subsection 712-2.16 as interim markings
 on seal coat and surface treatment pavements. Install the markers according to the
 manufacturer’s instructions before applying the asphalt surface material and cover coat. Remove
 the vinyl protective covers after applying the asphalt pavement.
 On multicourse surface treatments, install the temporary raised pavement markers after applying
 the full width of the first layer of cover coat. Install the markers on each day's completed surface
 before removing the pilot car operations and allowing unescorted traffic on the surface treatment.
 Do not place final pavement markings until traffic has traveled over the seal coat or surface
 treatment for at least 14 days. Apply final pavement markings within 10 days of completing the
 final sweeping or brooming of the mainline seal coat or surface treatment.
 643-3.10 LIGHTING FOR NIGHT WORK. Illuminate the night work areas according to Table
 643-4.
 Table 643-4 does not provide a comprehensive list of operations that require lighting. Provide
 lighting for other operations when necessary.
 Use balloon lighting as the main light sources. Do not use floodlights without prior approval by the
 Engineer. When approved, install floodlighting in a manner that minimizes glare for motorists,
 workers, and residents living along the roadway. Locate, aim, louver, and/or shield light sources
 to minimize glare.
 The Engineer shall be the sole judge of when glare is unacceptable, either for traffic or for
 adjoining residences. When notified of unacceptable glare, modify the lighting system to eliminate
 it.

 warranties, guaranties, instruction sheets, and parts furnished with materials used in the work
 before the Department assumes maintenance responsibilities.
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 660-3.01 GENERAL.
 1. Scheduling of Work. Complete each new traffic signal system, highway lighting system, and
 sign illumination system and ensure it is ready for operation before opening to traffic the
 corresponding section of new alignment.
 Do not place traffic signal systems in operation until the street lighting is energized at
 controlled intersections.
 Install detector loops and underground conduit before applying new pavement.
 Do not pull conductors into conduit until the junction boxes are set to grade, crushed rock
 sumps are installed, grout is placed around the conduit, and metallic conduit is bonded.
 In vehicular undercrossings, place soffit lights in operation as soon as practicable after
 removing falsework from the structure. Place lighting for pedestrian structures in operation
 before opening the structure to pedestrian traffic.
 2. Safety Precautions. Before starting work on existing street lighting circuits, de-energize the
 system by opening disconnect switches, and/or opening bypass switch plugs, and tagging
 each opened device as detailed in Part 4, Section 44, Article 440 of NESC. Where said
 
 415
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 circuits are under the control of an electric utility, obtain written assurance daily from the utility
 that the circuit being worked on has been de-energized.
 Post suitable signs at load centers when any of the circuits from that load center are being
 worked on.
 3. Excavating and Backfilling. Excavate as required for the installation of junction boxes,
 conduits, foundations, and other appurtenances. Avoid unnecessary damage to streets,
 sidewalks, landscaping, and other improvements.
 Do not excavate wider than necessary for the proper installation of conduits, junction boxes,
 and foundations. Do not perform excavation until immediately before installing conduit and
 other appurtenances.
 Excavate trenches for installing rigid metal conduit to a depth 6 inches below the bottom of
 the rigid metal conduit. Embed conduit between two 6-inch lifts of material that are free of
 rocks exceeding a 1-inch maximum dimension.
 Place the material from the excavation where it will not cause damage or obstruction to
 vehicular and pedestrian traffic or interfere with surface drainage. Dispose of all surplus
 excavated material according to Subsection 203-3.01.
 Backfill excavations according to Section 204.
 Keep excavations after backfilling well-filled and maintained in a smooth and well-drained
 condition until permanent repairs are made.
 4. Welding. Conform to Subsection 504-3.01.8, and the requirements of the individual items.
 5. Removing and Replacing Improvements. Replace or reconstruct improvements damaged by
 your operations such as sidewalks, curbs, gutters, pavement, base material, lawns and
 plants, and other improvements that are removed or broken with the same kind of material as
 found on the work, or with materials of equal or better quality. Leave the new work in
 satisfactory and serviceable condition.
 Whenever a part of a square or slab of existing sidewalk, curb and gutter, or driveway is
 broken or damaged, remove the entire square, section, or slab and reconstruct the concrete
 as above specified.
 Before removing the sidewalk, driveways, or pavement material, cut the outline of all areas to
 be removed in concrete sidewalks, driveways, and in pavements through completely with a
 saw. Make cuts neat and true and prevent shatter outside the removal area.
 6. Salvaging or Reusing Electrical Equipment. Salvage and deliver existing electrical equipment,
 including controller assemblies, signal equipment, luminaires, lighting standards, signal poles
 and mast arms, service equipment, and junction box lids to a location indicated on the Plans,
 the Special Provisions, or by the Engineer.

 Perform the inventory within 15 days following the Notice to Proceed. Note on the inventory
 the location and condition of all materials to be salvaged or reused.
 When a controller assembly is to be salvaged, the salvaged material includes the controller
 unit, timing modules, switches, detector control units, conflict monitor unit, and all other
 equipment contained in the controller cabinet before Contract award.
 
 416
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 When existing electrical equipment is to be reused, furnish and install all necessary materials
 and equipment, including signal mounting brackets, new tap wires, fused disconnect kits,
 anchor bolts, nuts, washers, and concrete as required to complete the new installation.
 Clean, relamp, and recondition all traffic signal, flashing beacon, and lighting fixtures to be
 reinstalled according to Subsection 660-3.01.8.b. You may elect to use new equipment if you
 determine that it will be more cost effective than reusing the old equipment called for in the
 Plans and/or Special Provisions. If using new equipment, notify the Engineer when submitting
 the equipment list(s) and drawings per Subsection 660-2.01.1. Include the submittals for the
 items proposed for use in lieu of the reused equipment with this submittal.
 Replace salvaged materials required to be reused and found to be unsatisfactory by the
 Engineer with new material. Replacement will be paid for as extra work under Subsection
 109-1.05.
 Remove and salvage electrical equipment without damage. Replace at your expense any of
 the above-mentioned electrical equipment that has been damaged or destroyed by your
 operations.
 Underground conduit, conductors, foundations, junction boxes, and detectors not reused
 become your property and must be removed from the highway right-of-way. If said materials,
 except conductors and cables, do not interfere with other construction they may, with
 approval, be abandoned in place with a credit taken by the Department. To limit future
 operation and maintenance concerns, remove all cables and conductors from any conduits
 that will be abandoned in place. Meet Subsection 660-3.02 for foundations abandoned in
 place.
 Repair holes left in the shafts of existing metal poles, due to removal of equipment or mast
 arms, by welding in a suitable disk, grinding smooth, and painting as provided for repair of
 damaged coatings in AASHTO M 36.
 As directed, repair or replace damaged existing metal poles that are to be relocated or
 reused in place. The Engineer will determine the extent of repairs or replacements. The
 Department will pay for the repairs or replacements ordered as extra work according to
 Subsection 109-1.05. Refinish poles according to Subsection 660-3.01.8.
 Fill holes formed by removing junction boxes and foundations with material equivalent to the
 surrounding material and compact to the same density.
 7. Field Tests. Before acceptance of the work, perform the following tests on all electrical
 systems under this Section, in the presence of the Engineer. Furnish the necessary
 equipment needed to perform these tests. The Department reserves the right to retest, and
 the test results will govern the acceptance or rejection of the installation. Replace or repair at
 your expense, and in an approved manner, any faults in material or any part of the installation
 revealed by these tests. Repeat the same test until no fault appears.
 a. Continuity. Test each circuit for continuity.
 Test each loop detector circuit for continuity at two locations:
 (1) Loop detector at the junction box before splicing with the loop detector lead-in cable
 must have a value less than 0.5 ohms.
 (2) Loop detector and lead-in cable system at the traffic signal controller cabinet or
 detector cabinet after splicing in the junction box must have a value less than 5 ohms
 for single pair lead-in cable and 10 ohms for multi-pair lead-in cable. The continuity
 test ohm reading at the traffic signal controller cabinet or detector cabinet must be
 greater than the ohm reading measured at the loop detector at the junction box.
 
 417
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 b. Grounds. Test for grounds in each circuit by physically examining the installation to
 ensure that all required grounding bushings, bonding jumpers, and ground rods have
 been installed and are mechanically firm.
 c.
 
 Insulation Resistance Test. Perform a megohm test on each circuit, between circuits, and
 between the circuit and a ground. Measure each detector loop and lead-in cable system
 at the traffic signal controller cabinet or at the detector cabinet between one loop detector
 lead-in conductor and the cabinet ground rod. Ensure the insulation resistance is not less
 than 100 megohms or the minimum specified by the manufacturer, measured at 500 volts
 DC. Disconnect all lamps and magnetometer sensing probes prior to the megger test.
 Document these tests in writing, for each circuit, and submit to the Engineer prior to
 acceptance of the system.
 
 d. Inductance Test. Measure each detector loop and lead-in cable system at the traffic
 signal controller cabinet or detector cabinet. The inductance must be in the range of 50 to
 500 microhenries.
 e. Circuit. Energize every signal indication circuit with lamps installed before installing the
 load switches.
 f.
 
 Functional. Perform the following tests on each signal and lighting system after all of the
 component circuits have satisfactorily passed the tests for continuity, grounding,
 insulation integrity and circuitry.
 (1) Perform the functional test for each new traffic signal system by running at least 24
 hours of flashing operation, followed by not less than 5 days of continuous,
 satisfactory operation. You may omit the flashing portion of the test for a modified
 signal system or if there was an existing signal maintained at this location during the
 construction activity.
 The Engineer and the final owner of the signal system will determine if the flashing
 operation will be required. If the system performs unsatisfactorily, correct the
 condition and repeat the test until the system runs for 5 days with continuous
 satisfactory operation.
 Do not start signal functional tests on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, a legal holiday, or
 the day before the legal holiday.
 Initially turn on the system between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Before turning it on,
 ensure all equipment is installed and operable. This includes, but is not limited to,
 pedestrian signals and push buttons; signal face backplates and visors; vehicle
 detectors; highway lighting; and all regulatory, warning, and guide signs. Aim all
 signal faces as required by Subsection 660-3.08.
 (2) Perform the functional test for each highway lighting system and sign illumination
 system until the systems burn continuously 5 days without the photocell, followed by
 a 5-day operational test using the photocell.
 (3) Perform the functional test for each flashing beacon system for not less than 5 days
 of continuous, satisfactory operation.
 (4) Perform a continuous 5-day burning test on each pedestrian overcrossing and
 undercrossing lighting system before final acceptance.
 A shut down of the electrical system due to a power interruption does not constitute
 discontinuity of the functional test if the system is functional when the power is
 returned.

 8. Repairing Damaged Finishes. Examine all exterior surfaces for damage in the field, including
 new, reused, and State-furnished equipment. Repair damaged finishes as follows:
 a. Galvanized. Repair damage to galvanized coatings in conformance with AASHTO M 36.
 b. Painted.
 (1) Wash the equipment with a stiff bristle brush using a solution of water containing 2
 tablespoons of heavy-duty detergent powder per gallon. After rinsing, wire brush all
 surfaces to remove all poorly bonded paint, rust, scale, corrosion, grease, or dirt.
 Remove any dust or residue remaining after wire brushing before priming.
 (2) You may use factory or shop cleaning methods for metals if equal to the methods
 specified herein.
 (3) Immediately after cleaning, coat all bare metal with pre-treatment, vinyl wash primer,
 followed by 2 prime coats of zinc chromate primer for metal.
 (4) Give signal equipment, excluding standards, a spot-finishing coat on newly primed
 areas, followed by 1 finishing coat over the entire surface.
 (5) Give ungalvanized standards 2 spot-finish coats on newly primed areas.
 You may apply all paint coats either by hand brushing or by approved spraying machines.
 Perform the work in a neat and workmanlike manner. The Engineer reserves the right to
 require the use of brushes for the application of paint, should the work done by the paint
 spraying machine prove unacceptable.
 660-3.02 FOUNDATIONS.
 1. Cast-in-Place Foundations. Cast-in-place foundations for posts and poles in drilled holes.
 Use either precast or cast-in-place foundations for cabinets.
 a. Form the entire controller foundation and the top 12 inches of pole or post foundations
 and give the top a smooth steel trowel finish.
 b. Place conduits in the center of the pole-post foundations with clearance allowed for
 bushings. If subsurface conditions prevent completing a drilled hole, and when approved,
 use a corrugated metal pipe (CMP) form as a substitute for the drilled hole. Consider the
 savings in concrete to offset the cost of supplying and installing the CMP form. No
 additional payment will be made for the CMP formed foundation.
 c.
 
 When a CMP is used, over-excavate the area around the form enough to allow for proper
 compaction around the form. Perform backfill operations according to Section 204. Do
 not use water for drilling operations or for any other purpose where it may enter the hole.
 
 d. Use controller cabinet anchor bolts as recommended by cabinet manufacturer and set
 with a template.
 e. Place Class A concrete meeting Section 501. Place reinforcing steel meeting Section
 503. If required, use corrugated steel pipe that is at least 14 gage, meeting Subsection
 707-2.01.
 f.
 
 Drill holes or use forms that are vertical and true to the locations shown in the Plans.
 When foundation excavation is complete, but before placing the concrete, remove all
 loose material to ensure that the foundation rests on firm, undisturbed ground.
 
 419
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 g. If a reinforcing steel cage is required, place and secure it symmetrically about the vertical
 axis and securely block it to clear the sides of the foundation. Use a template to securely
 support all anchor bolt assemblies and conduit ends so they do not move during concrete
 placement.
 h. Do not permit surface water to enter the hole. Before placing concrete, remove all water
 that may have infiltrated in the hole. Thoroughly moisten both the forms and the ground
 before placing concrete. Pour each foundation in one continuous pour.
 i.
 
 Do not erect or place posts, poles, and pedestals on the foundation until 7 days after
 placing the concrete. Plumb the assembly by adjusting the nuts on the anchor bolts prior
 to grouting.
 
 j.
 
 Replace, with no additional compensation, all finished concrete pile caps with anchor
 bolts that do not match the base plate of the pole or are out of plumb. Do not modify the
 anchor bolts or base plate to get the base plate set on the leveling nuts.
 
 k.
 
 Install the bottoms of the bottom leveling nuts in a level plane within one inch of the top of
 concrete pile cap. Generously lubricate the bearing surface and internal threads of all top
 nuts with beeswax and tighten the top nuts according to the anchor bolt tightening
 procedure included in the contract documents.
 
 2. Pile Foundations.
 a. Install pipe piles according to Section 505.
 b. Install pipe piles open-ended and to a minimum depth of 15 feet (less top projection).
 c.
 
 Use CJP groove welds for all circumferential welds.
 
 d. Inspect 100 percent of CJP welds using UT or RT.
 e. Backfill and compact the work hole around upper portion of each pile in 8-inch lifts with a
 soil-cement mixture. (minimum of 3 sacks of cement per cubic yard of soil).
 f.
 
 Certify steel pipe piles by matching the stencils on the pipe piles (by 300 foot lots) to the
 physical and chemical tests for the applicable lot.
 
 3. All Foundations.
 a. Install frangible couplings according to the manufacturers written installation instructions.
 Use shims furnished by the coupling manufacturer.
 b. Provide new foundations and anchor bolts of the proper type and size for standards that
 are to be relocated. Install the anchor bolts on a bolt circle that matches the base plate.
 c.
 
 Install a raised Type III junction box on the door side of the controller cabinet, and butt it
 against the cabinet’s foundation unless installing a one-piece cabinet/junction box
 foundation. Extend the top of the controller cabinet foundation 18 inches above the
 junction box and provide it with a 1-inch diameter drain. The drain connected to the
 cabinet interior must empty to the rear and above the ground. Place all conduits in the
 door side half of the foundation to provide adequate terminal block clearance.
 
 d. Existing foundations may be abandoned-in-place. However, remove the tops of the
 foundations, reinforcing steel, anchor bolts, and conduits to at least 12 inches below the
 roadway subgrade, sidewalk, or unimproved ground. Backfill the resulting hole with
 material equivalent to and compacted to the density of the surrounding ground.
 
 420
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 660-3.03 CONDUIT. Run electrical conductors in conduit, except for overhead wiring, wiring
 inside poles, and when otherwise specified. Use galvanized conduit and fittings that are rigid
 metal type and manufactured of mild steel or wrought iron.
 1. If called for in the Plans, use rigid non-metallic type conduit. Where nonmetallic conduit is to
 be installed, use a rigid metal type conduit to run between a load-center and the nearest
 junction box. Use conduit routing as noted or detailed on the Plans; when it is not shown, use
 the routing as directed.
 2. If conduit and fittings to be installed will be exposed to sunlight on the surfaces of poles or in
 structures and foundations, use rigid metal type.
 3. Thread and ream the ends of all conduits, whether shop or field cut, to remove burrs and
 rough edges. Make cuts square and true so that the ends butt together for the full
 circumference. Do not use slip joint or running threads for coupling conduit. When a standard
 coupling cannot be used for coupling metal type conduit, use an approved threaded union
 coupling. Where the coating on ferrous metal conduit has been damaged, paint such
 damaged places with rust preventative paint.
 4. Until wiring is started, cap all conduit ends with standard pipe caps or approved plug and
 coupling combinations. When caps are removed, provide the threaded ends with approved
 conduit grounding bushings.
 5. Bury conduit at least 30 inches below the finished grade. However, under paved areas
 behind a curb, bury the conduit at least 18 inches below the top back of curb or abutting
 pavement, whichever is lower. See Subsection 660-3.01.3 for backfill requirements.
 6. Install rigid metal conduit under existing pavements which are 30 feet wide or less by jacking.
 Unless trenching is called for in the Plans, install conduits under existing pavements greater
 than 30 feet wide by boring or drilling methods.
 7. When encountering obstructions during jacking or drilling operations, obtain approval and cut
 small test holes in the pavement to clear the obstruction. Locate the bottom inside face of the
 borepit no closer than the catch point of a 1-1/4:1 slope from the edge of pavement. Do not
 leave these pits unattended until the means of protection has been approved.
 8. Keep the bottom of trenches for non-metallic conduit relatively free of sharp irregularities that
 would cause pinching and excessive bending of the conduit.
 9. Ensure that the first 6 inches of backfill is free of rocks exceeding 1 inch maximum
 dimension.
 10. Terminate the conduit entering the bottom of concrete junction boxes with a 90-degree sweep
 inside the box wall. Terminate conduit openings not less than 5 inches above the bottom of
 all boxes, a minimum of 6 inches below the top of the Type IA boxes, and 12 inches below
 the top of Type II and Type III boxes. Extend conduits entering through the junction box wall a
 minimum of 2 inches beyond the inside box wall, and ensure it is a minimum of 6 inches
 above the bottom of the box.
 11. Furnish foundations with conduits as shown on the Plans. Extend the conduits a maximum of
 2 inches vertically above the foundation and slope towards the handhole opening.
 3
 
 12. At low points in all conduit runs, install a drain and sump containing approximately 2 ft of
 coarse concrete aggregate material. Compact aggregate used for sump as directed to
 prevent settlement of foundations, junction boxes, or adjacent improvements. Place
 additional drains adjacent to all junction boxes and structures, regardless of the method of
 conduit placement used. The drains must be a 3/8-inch hole drilled in the bottom of the lower
 
 421
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 straight section of the sweep elbow. Prevent scraping of conductors by deburring drilled drain
 holes in conduit. Wrap the exterior of the hole with approved filter cloth material and secure it
 as directed or approved by the Engineer.
 13. Provide conduits for future use with grounding bushings, bonded to ground, and capped with
 an approved plastic insert type plug. Install a polypropylene pull rope with 200 pound
 minimum tensile strength in all conduits that are to receive future conductors. Double back at
 least 2 feet of pull rope into the conduits at each end.
 14. Mark all underground conduit with a continuous strip of polyethylene marker tape that is 4
 mils thick and 6 inches wide. Mark the tape with a black legend on a red background and
 bury it 9 inches (±3 inches) below the finished grade. Lay two strips of marker tape side-byside under all road crossings.
 15. Where new junction boxes are placed in existing rigid metal conduit runs, fit the conduit with
 threaded bushings and bond them.
 16. Seal the conduit leading to soffit, wall, or other lights or fixtures below the grade of the
 junction box by using an approved sealing fitting and sealing compound.
 17. Clean existing underground conduit to be reused in the new system before pulling in the new
 cables, as follows:
 a. Conduits with reused conductors. Wherever the Plans show reusing existing conduits
 that contain in service cables, clean them using compressed air. Existing cables that will
 be reused may be left in the conduits while you clean them.
 b. Conduits with no reused conductors. Ream with a mandrel or cylindrical wire brush and
 blow out with compressed air.
 c.
 
 Use a heavy-duty air compressor that delivers at least 125 cubic feet per minute of air at
 110 psi.
 
 18. Use conduit of larger size than shown on the Plans, when desired. If used, it must be for the
 entire length of the run from junction box to junction box. Reducing couplings are not allowed.
 Increase the size of the junction boxes and perform any additional work at the foundations
 due to the use of larger size conduit, without extra compensation.
 19. Conduits may require routing under or over existing culverts or storm drain systems and other
 underground utilities with additional drains and aggregate sumps at the low spots.
 20. When extending existing conduits or installing junction boxes in existing conduit runs, extend
 the conduit into the proposed junction box or foundation using drains, elbows, and bonding as
 required for new installations. When adjusting junction boxes, shorten or lengthen existing
 conduits to meet clearance requirements. Complete extensions and modifications to existing
 conduits using the same size and types of materials.
 21. Cut off abandoned conduits flush with the inside wall or bottom of junction boxes.
 22. Install expansion fittings, as detailed on the structure plans, where the conduit crosses an
 expansion joint in the structure. Provide each expansion fitting with a bonding jumper
 equivalent to a stranded, No. 6 AWG, copper wire, or equivalent copper braid. Use
 expansion-deflection fittings that are waterproof and permit a 3/4 inch expansion and
 contraction and a 3/4 inch deflection without deformation.
 660-3.04 JUNCTION BOXES. Furnish pre-cast reinforced concrete junction boxes of the sizes
 and details shown on the Plans. Use cast iron lids.
 
 422
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 Emboss the word TRAFFIC on the lids of all junction boxes that contain any traffic signal
 conductors. Emboss the word LIGHTING on the lids of all other junction boxes.
 Install junction boxes at the approximate locations shown on the Plans or when a location is not
 specific, locate the junction boxes as directed. You may, at your expense, install additional
 junction boxes to facilitate the work. Locate junction boxes so they are not in the roadway,
 sidewalk, or pathway surfaces. Where practical, place junction boxes shown in the vicinity of
 curbs adjacent to the back of curb with their long dimension parallel to the curb. Do not locate
 junction boxes in drainage collection areas.
 Effectively ground the covers of all junction boxes with metal covers. Use a 3-foot tinned copper
 braid for Type IA Junction Boxes and a 6-foot tinned copper braid for Type II and Type III
 Junction Boxes.
 Bed the entire bottom of all junction boxes on coarse concrete aggregate material of a minimum
 depth of 18 inches.
 Place the top of junction boxes flush with the sidewalk grade or top of adjacent curb. When
 located in an unpaved section adjacent to a paved shoulder, locate the junction box 1 inch below
 the finished grade. Install flush with the surface in paved areas. Adjust as directed the junction
 boxes located in areas requiring grading. Adjust junction boxes located in seeded areas to 2
 inches below the surface.
 Locate junction boxes immediately adjacent to the pole or fixture they serve with the following
 limitations:
 1. 300 feet maximum for any single cable conduit run or any conduit run that exclusively
 contains 2 or fewer 2-conductor No. 12 loop lead-in cables.
 2. 190 feet maximum for any other conduit runs.
 3. If the limitations require additional junction boxes, locate them on equal spacing subject to the
 above limitations.
 660-3.05 WIRING. Wire all cabinets with conductors sized to handle the amperage drawn under
 full cabinet use. Make wiring neat in cabinets by cabling wires together with self-clinching nylon
 ties. Terminate all spare conductors on terminal blocks. Attach all conductors, including spares, to
 terminal blocks with “spade” type terminal lugs. Furnish additional terminal blocks if enough
 locations are unavailable in existing terminal blocks. Do not splice conductors within cabinets,
 poles, signal heads, and luminaires.
 Pull conductors into conduit only after junction boxes are set to grade, crushed rock sumps are
 installed, grout is placed around the conduit, and grounding bushings have been installed on all
 conduits.
 1. Pull conductors by hand or by approved commercially built cable-pulling equipment that is
 specially designed for that purpose. Do not pull cable by any other means. Equip the cable
 pulling device with a force limiting circuit and force gauge.
 2. Use wire-pulling lubricant when placing the cables and conductors in conduit. Do not allow
 the tension of the wire or cable to exceed the manufacturer’s recommend allowable tension
 for the conductor or cable.
 3. When adding new conductors to a conduit with existing conductors, remove all conductors
 and clean the conduit with a mandrel or brush. Pull both old and new conductors through as a
 unit. In a new installation, pull all conductors through the conduit as a unit.
 
 423
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 4. Leave at least 1 foot of slack in the bottom of each signal or combination signal and lighting
 pole of each signal conductor or cable. Neatly leave at least 3 feet of slack illumination and
 signal conductor or cable curled up in the bottom of each junction box or splice location.
 5. Separate the neutral for pedestrian push button circuits from the signal light circuit neutral.
 6. Run all signal and feeder conductors continuously without splices from a terminal block
 located in a cabinet, compartment, or signal head, to a similarly located terminal block. When
 modifying an existing signal system, splice existing conductors (cables) to new conductors
 (cables) as required to complete the signal, opticom, and interconnect systems. Make these
 splices only in pole bases, signal terminal compartments, or the controller cabinet.
 7. Route highway illumination cable through each lighting pole designated for connection to that
 cable’s circuit. Do not splice illumination cable between a load center and a pole or between
 poles. Join the individual conductors by using non-insulated, overlap type pressure
 connectors. Insulate with mastic-lined heat shrink tubing or 2 layers of one-half lapped UL
 listed electrical tape. Do not use wire binding screws, studs, or nuts. Stagger splices to
 minimize the overall diameter.
 8. Install all loops in 1-inch rigid schedule 80 PVC conduit in the roadway and to the nearest
 junction box. Run loop lead-in cable continuously without splices from the controller cabinet
 to the curbside detection junction box nearest the loop being spliced to the lead-in cable.
 Splice the loop(s) to the lead-in cable by soldering at the junction box and encapsulating in a
 waterproof splice kit.
 Multiple loop configurations must have the individual lead-ins, multiple pair, or single pair
 brought to the controller cabinet for termination. Make series connection of loop lead-ins in
 the controller cabinet only. Wind all loops in the same direction with the starting lead marked
 with an “S.” Connect the black conductor of the pair shown in Table 660-1 to the “S”
 designated conductor of the loop. Connect multiple loop detectors in the same lane so that
 the adjacent loops are in alternating directions clock wise (CW), counter clock wise (CCW),
 etc.
 9. When splicing loop detectors to multi-pair loop lead-in cables, complete the work according to
 the following.
 a. See the Plans for the identifying number assigned to each loop detector and the loops
 assigned to each loop lead-in cable. Using this information, splice the loop detector tails
 to the paired conductors found in each lead-in cable, using the color code in Table 660-1.

 b. Remove a short section of cable jacket and only cut the shielded pairs dedicated to loop
 detectors being spliced. Run these pairs, without splices, to the controller cabinet.
 c.
 
 Strip the insulation from the ends of the conductors. With the loop and lead-in conductors
 parallel to one another, twist the bare ends together and then solder them together.
 
 424
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 d. Insulate and seal each soldered connection with a mastic lined heat shrink tubing; crimp
 the ends of the heat shrink tubing with a pair of needle nose pliers.
 e. First, crimp and then solder spade terminals to the ends of the shielded pairs in the
 controller cabinet.
 10. Maintain the electrical isolation between shields and do not allow the drain wires to come in
 contact at any point other than the ground bus in the cabinet. Tie all drain wires to the ground
 bus at the controller cabinet.
 11. Encapsulate illumination cable conductor splices in a rigid, 2-piece, transparent, snap
 together, plastic mold specifically designed for each splice type.
 Encapsulate all loop lead-in cable splices in rigid, transparent, PVC molds filled with reenterable polyurethane electrical insulating and sealing compound. Furnish splice kits rated
 for 1000 volts AC operation and direct burial.
 Provide re-useable four piece molds that are held together with stainless steel hose clamps.
 Two pieces form a cylinder and two flexible end caps seal the ends and allow the conductor
 entry. Use molds with dimensions suitable for the splice made, encase the cable jackets, and
 have fill and vent funnels.
 Insert a loose woven polyester web that allows a full 1/4 inch of insulating compound to flow
 between the splice and the inside of the mold. Fill the PVC molds with re-enterable
 polyurethane electrical insulating and sealing compound that cures transparent, is nontoxic,
 is non-corrosive to copper, and does not support fungi or mold growth.
 12. Use molds with dimensions suitable for the splice, to encase the cable jackets, to be rated for
 600 volts, and have fill and vent funnels for epoxy resin. Fill the splice mold bodies with epoxy
 resin that is resistant to weather, aromatic and straight chain solvents, and that will not
 sustain combustion. When filling the mold bodies of loop lead-in and telemetry cable splices,
 use a compound that provides re-entry capabilities.
 13. Permanently identify all cables and single wire conductors by labeling all pole bases and
 cabinets, at each detector loop tail/lead-in cable and illumination cable splices, and in junction
 boxes adjacent to lighting and signal poles. When modifying an existing system, label all new
 and existing lighting cables/conductors with circuit numbers at locations noted above. If the
 existing circuits are not identified, the Engineer will provide the required circuit numbers.
 14. Label the cables used in the signal and illumination systems with the following legends:
 a. Use the legends included in Table 740-2, for the cables listed.
 b. Use the loop number shown on the Plans to label each tail of all loop detectors and the
 paired loop lead-in conductors in the controller cabinet.
 c.
 
 For interconnect cables, use the first letter of the direction the cable follows to the
 adjacent intersection on each cable. Add a number suffix if more than one cable is routed
 to the adjacent intersection.
 
 Furnish the two types of identification tags listed below that feature hand written legends.
 Write the legends specified neatly and legibly, using a black marking pen recommended by
 the tag manufacturer. Replace at no expense to the State all identification tags the Engineer
 deems illegible.
 a. Use identification cable ties for labeling loop detector tails and the paired conductors
 included in each loop lead-in cable in the controller cabinet. Furnish identification cable

 Provide the plug and socket assembly so that the fuse remains in the load side plug without
 exposing live metal parts when the connector separates and the coil springs are not included
 in the current carrying circuit.
 Make the fused connectors readily accessible from the handhole. Install tap conductors to
 prevent slack when their ends touch the top of the foundation.
 660-3.06 BONDING AND GROUNDING. Make the following mechanically and electrically
 secure: metallic cable sheaths, metal conduit, non-metallic conduit grounding wire, ballast and
 transformer cases, service equipment, sign switches, pedestrian push buttons, metal poles, and
 pedestals. These items must form a continuous system and be grounded.
 Ground metal conduit, service equipment, and neutral conductor at service point as required by
 the Code and the serving utility, except that grounding electrode conductor must be No. 6 AWG,
 or equal. Use copper wire or copper braid bonding and grounding jumpers of the same crosssectional area as No. 8 AWG for all other systems. When installing conduit as a spare for future
 use, you may omit the grounding conductor.
 Furnish threaded-type grounding bushings made of malleable iron or steel with a zinc or
 galvanized finish. Use bushings with an insulated throat, a tin-plated copper saddle for attaching
 the grounding conductors, and stainless steel set screws.
 Retrofit all existing spare conduits that will contain new cables exclusively with new grounding
 bushings. Whenever you reuse an existing conduit that contains no ground conductor, install a
 bare size 8 AWG copper wire as the ground conductor. Where conduits are installed for future
 conductors, the above mentioned copper wire may be omitted.
 Install a bare copper conductor in all conduit as the grounding conductor. Attach grounding
 conductors to each end of the metal conduit using insulated throat grounding bushings. Leave 12
 inches of slack between each grounding bushing. Allow clearance for bushings when installing
 conduits in foundations.
 Bond slip-base type standards and pedestals by using 2 conductors from the conduit, one
 attached with a ground rod clamp to an anchor bolt and the other connected to the lower portion
 of the shaft. Bond standards with frangible coupling type bases by attaching one conductor from

 660-3.09 MAINTAINING TEMPORARY AND EXISTING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. Keep in
 effective operation during the progress of the work all existing electrical systems (traffic signal,
 highway and street lighting, flashing beacon, and sign illumination), and approved temporary
 replacements except when shutdown is permitted to allow for alterations or final removal of the
 systems. Temporary replacement equipment must be compatible with existing equipment used in
 the Region. Limit traffic signal shutdowns to the period Sunday through Thursday between the
 hours of 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., unless otherwise specified in Subsection 643-3.08. Do not allow
 
 432
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 lighting system shutdowns to interfere with the regular lighting schedule. Obtain written approval
 before performing any work on existing systems.
 Notify the local traffic enforcement and maintenance agencies at least 24 hours before the
 operational shutdown of a traffic signal system. Provide necessary traffic control under Section
 643.
 Where an existing system is being modified, the Department will pay for work not shown on the
 Plans or Special Provisions that is considered necessary to keep all or part of the existing system
 in effective operation as extra work as provided in Subsection 109-1.05.
 Once commencing work on the project, provide all maintenance for temporary and existing
 electrical facilities. The State will pay for the electrical power for the above mentioned electrical
 systems. The above maintenance does not include previous damage such as burned out lamps,
 non-operative detection, or other malfunctioning equipment. Present written documentation of all
 non-functioning and malfunctioning electrical equipment before commencing work on the project.
 You and the Engineer will inspect this equipment jointly. If work begins on the Project and the
 Engineer does not receive written notice, this is considered evidence that all equipment is
 functional and operational.
 Give the Engineer the name and 24-hour phone number of the person maintaining the existing
 and temporary electrical facilities. Commence repair work within 1 hour of notification for traffic
 signal systems.
 Ascertain the exact location of existing conduit runs, direct burial cable, junction boxes, and all
 underground utilities before using equipment that may damage such facilities or interfere with any
 system.
 Where roadways are to remain open to traffic and existing lighting systems are to be modified,
 complete work each day so the lighting system will be in operation by sunset.
 When you work on a traffic signal system, keep a record of all work performed in a diary located
 in the controller cabinet. Furnish a diary for each temporary system. Make sure each entry is
 printed legibly and includes:
 1. The dates and times you began and completed your work, and the names of the
 crewmembers completing the work.
 2. The characteristics of the equipment failure or faulty operation evident before repair.
 3. The changes made or corrective actions taken.
 4. The printed name and signature of the person responsible for making the repairs or changes.
 Keep temporary electrical installations in effective operation until they are no longer required.
 Salvage all original and Department-provided equipment according to the provisions in
 Subsection 660-3.01.6 and remove all other materials from the project.
 660-3.10 FALSEWORK LIGHTING. When required by the Special Provisions, install falsework
 lighting where vehicular traffic with or without pedestrian traffic crosses through or under structure
 falsework.
 Provide illumination of the portal faces of falsework during the hours from dusk to dawn. Provide
 illumination of the pavement and pedestrian openings through or under falsework 24 hours a day.
 
 433
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 660
 
 Submit a plan for the proposed lighting installations and do not commence falsework construction
 until the Engineer has reviewed such plans. The Engineer will make a subsequent review after
 you place falsework lights in operation.
 Falsework lighting equipment remains your property and must be removed from the site of the
 work upon completion of the project or when directed.
 660-4.01 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. Section 109 and the following:

 TRAFFIC MARKINGS
 670-1.01 DESCRIPTION. Furnish and place traffic markings of the type, color, dimensions, and
 at the locations shown on the Plans. Meet these specifications and the applicable portions of the
 Alaska Traffic Manual.
 670-2.01 MATERIALS. Use materials that conform to the following:
 Traffic Paint
 Glass Beads
 Preformed Pavement Markings
 Raised and Recessed Pavement Markers
 Methyl Methacrylate Markings
 Glass Beads for Methyl Methacrylate Markings
 
 Subsection 708-2.03
 Subsection 712-2.08
 Subsection 712-2.14
 Subsection 712-2.15
 Subsection 712-2.17
 Subsection 712-2.18
 
 Construct the iron casting for the raised pavement markers of modular iron meeting ASTM A536.
 Submit a manufacturer certification for both the Methyl Methacrylate material and glass beads to
 certify that the materials furnished conform to these Specifications.
 670-3.01 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. Install interim pavement markings meeting
 Section 643 if permanent markings are not installed prior to opening the roadway to traffic.
 1. Paint.
 a. Apply paint only to pavements that are clean, dry, and warmer than 40 °F.
 b. Remove all dirt, oil, grease, and other foreign matter from the surfaces to be painted in a
 satisfactory manner.
 c.
 
 2
 
 Apply the paint at the rate of 80 ft /gal (approximately 20 mils wet film thickness). This
 rate is effectively 22 gallons of paint per mile of solid 4-inch stripe. A tolerance not to
 exceed 10 percent is allowed for film thickness or yield.
 
 d. Apply glass beads over the wet painted stripes in a uniform pattern at the rate of 6
 pounds (± 0.1 pound) of beads per gallon of paint. Pressure-apply the beads using a
 mechanical dispenser mounted not more than 12 inches behind the paint dispenser.
 e. Use approved equipment for highway lane striping that is specifically designed and
 manufactured for that purpose by a company experienced in the design and manufacture
 of such equipment. Minimum requirements include the capability of striping two 4-inch
 yellow centerlines and one 4-inch white edge line simultaneously. Apply markings with
 clear-cut edges, true and smooth alignment, and uniform film thickness.
 2. Preformed Marking Tapes (PMT). Apply the PMT material as directed by the manufacturer by
 either the inlay or overlay method. Use the inlay method whenever new asphalt concrete is
 placed. Use the overlay method to apply markings to existing pavement.
 Store all PMT materials between 60 °F and 85 °F for at least 24 hours prior to installation.
 During installation, maintain field stockpiles at the required storage temperature.
 For the inlay method, embed the pavement markings in the asphalt concrete surface with a
 conventional steel wheeled roller. Apply when the surface temperature of the mat is the
 warmest possible without deforming the marking. The minimum allowable surface
 temperature, taken within 3/8 inch of the top of the mat, is 140 °F.
 
 439
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 670
 
 If the application of the PMT materials falls behind the paving operation to the extent that the
 markings are not being applied at the minimum acceptable temperature, slow the paving
 operation to match the rate of the marking laydown. Resume full paving operations after
 demonstrating that you have sufficiently skilled personnel to install the markings within the
 required temperature limits.
 When applying pavement markings by the overlay method, ensure the surface is clean and
 dry and is at least 60 °F and rising. Broom the surface clean. Remove any dust using
 compressed air. Apply a coat of primer/adhesive activator according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Install and roll the markings with a minimum 200-pound pneumatic roller.
 3. Raised and Recessed Pavement Markers. Install raised and recessed pavement markers per
 the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Cut or dado the finished pavement surface with a concrete saw to produce a slot with
 dimensions as shown on the Plans or recommended by the manufacturer. Clean and dry the
 slots using compressed air. Install a reflective marker of the color indicated with an epoxy
 adhesive recommended by the marker manufacturer.
 4. Methyl Methacrylate Pavement Markings.
 a. General. Provide installation instructions for the methyl methacrylate markings a
 minimum of 15 days prior to application. Retain a copy of the instructions for use on the
 project.
 Ensure the on-site presence of a manufacturer's representative on the first day of striping
 and any additional days as required.
 b. Preparation. Prepare the roadway areas to receive methyl methacrylate pavement
 markings according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Clean and dry roadway
 surface. Remove contaminants such as curing agents, surface oils, or existing road
 marking materials prior to applying pavement marking material. Do not apply marking to
 new asphalt until the asphalt has cured for at least 15 days.
 c.
 
 Application. Apply methyl methacrylate marking material according to the manufacturer's
 installation instructions and the recommendations of the manufacturer's representative.
 Use equipment designed and capable of properly mixing at the point and time of
 application.
 (1) Longitudinal Markings. Apply markings for lane lines, edge lines, and centerlines at a
 thickness of 60 ± 5 mils. Apply glass beads at the drop rate specified in Subsection
 712-2.18 by double bead gun, one gun directly in front of the spray unit and another
 directly behind.
 (2) Transverse Markings. Apply markings for crosswalks, stop bars, symbols, transverse
 markings between gore and channelization striping, and legend markings at a
 thickness of 120 ± 5 mils. Apply Sinker beads as specified in Subsection 712-2.18 at
 2
 a minimum drop rate of 1 lb/yd .
 
 d. Sampling. Collect a representative sample of spray material by placing a flat sheet of
 aluminum in the path of the striping guns. Collect the sample without glass beads.
 Measure the thickness of the sample without glass beads utilizing a wet film thickness
 gage.
 670-3.04 PAVEMENT MARKING REMOVAL. Remove all existing traffic markings that are in
 conflict with the striping details shown on the Plans, an approved TCP, or any temporary striping
 as directed. Do not paint over existing markings. Do not use open flame on the final paving lift.
 
 440
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 670
 
 Remove pavement markings to the fullest extent possible without materially damaging the
 pavement surface, color, or texture. As the work progresses, remove sand or other material
 deposited on the pavement as a result of removing markings. Remove accumulations of sand or
 other material that might interfere with drainage or constitute a hazard to traffic.
 Before making any change in the traffic pattern, remove or obliterate pavement markings that
 may create confusion to motorists.
 Where using blast cleaning to remove pavement markings or objectionable material within 10 feet
 of a lane occupied by public traffic, immediately remove the residue (including dust) after contact
 between the sand and the surface being treated. For such removal, use a vacuum attachment
 operating concurrently with the blast cleaning operation or by other approved methods.
 Repair any damaged pavement or surfacing caused by the pavement marking removal operation.
 670-3.05 PRELIMINARY SPOTTING. Provide the necessary control points at intervals including
 all changes of direction and changes in the basic configuration of striping, such as at the
 beginning and ending of no-passing zones on a 2-way, 2-lane roadway. Use these points in
 preliminary spotting of lines before striping is commenced. Perform preliminary spotting of the
 lines to be painted and obtain approval for all spotting before striping begins. Preliminary spotting
 is required for all longitudinal striping, with spacing of spots not to exceed 50 feet.
 Reference the lines and markings to be replaced at their existing locations prior to performing any
 work that may disturb them.
 670-3.06 TOLERANCES FOR LANE STRIPING.
 1. Length of Stripe. ±6 inches in 40 feet
 2. Width of Stripe. ±1/4 inch
 3. Lane Width. ±4 inches from the widths shown on the Plans (measured from the edge of
 pavement or edge of traveled way to center of lane line or between the centers of adjacent
 lane lines)
 4. Stripes on Tangent. Do not vary more than 1 inch laterally within a distance of 100 feet when
 using the edge of the stripe as a reference.
 5. Stripes on Curves. Uniform in alignment with no apparent deviations from the true curvature
 6. All Stripes. Keep the center of the stripe within 4 inches from the planned alignment.
 Traffic markings not within the above tolerances are unacceptable under Subsection 105-1.11.
 670-4.01 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. Section 109 and the following:
 1. Mile Basis. By the horizontal distance along centerline from beginning to end of each stripe
 pattern, excluding gaps for intersections or other openings. Skip stripes will be measured as
 1/4 of this distance.
 a. Single Stripe: A longitudinal marking less than 6 inches wide, such as, but not limited to,
 a single center line or edge stripe.
 b. Double or Wide Stripe: A longitudinal marking greater than 6 inches wide, such as, but
 not limited to, double center lines, and auxiliary lane lines.
 
 441
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 670
 
 2. Square Foot Basis. Transverse pavement marking lines 6 inches or more wide will be
 measured by nominal width times actual length.
 3. Each. All other transverse markings will be measured on a unit basis with each separate
 word or symbol constituting a unit.
 Raised or recessed pavement markers will be measured per each unit installed complete.
 670-5.01 BASIS OF PAYMENT. At the contract price per unit of measurement for those items
 listed below that appear on the bid schedule.
 Accept payment as full compensation for cleaning of pavement, painting traffic markings,
 application of preformed pavement markings, glass beads, installing raised or recessed
 pavement markers, furnishing paint, glass beads, preformed marking tape and all other materials
 necessary to complete the work prescribed in this Section.
 When Item 670(9) Removal of Pavement Markings is not shown on the bid schedule, it is
 subsidiary to other items of work.
 For traffic markings which do not conform to the requirements of this Section but which are
 allowed to remain in place, payment will be adjusted as follows:
 1. Lump Sum. When payment is on a lump sum basis the price reduction will be the product of
 the lump sum price times the length of non-conforming markings divided by the total length of
 markings. For the purpose of this calculation, stripe lengths will be considered as continuous
 with no deduction for skips or breaks, for each 4-inch width stripe being applied, except that a
 double centerline stripe (No Pass) will be considered as one stripe.
 2. Unit Prices. When payment is on a unit price basis, no payment will be made for those units
 which are not in conformance.

 PRESTRESSING STEEL AND FITTINGS
 721-2.01 SCOPE. Prestressing steel and fittings used in pre-tensioned and post-tensioned
 concrete construction.
 721-2.02 PRESTRESSING STEEL. Meet the following:
 Steel Strand
 Uncoated Stress-Relieved Steel Wire
 High Strength Steel Bars
 
 AASHTO M 203
 AASHTO M 204. Do not use oil-tempered wires.
 AASHTO M 275
 
 721-2.03 POST-TENSIONING SYSTEM. Use only post-tensioning systems that utilize tendons
 fully encapsulated in anchorages and ducts. Systems that transfer prestress force by bonding the
 prestress steel directly to concrete are not allowed. Use only post-tensioning systems that are
 approved by the Engineer and meet the following requirements:
 1. Anchorage and Distribution. Secure prestressing steel at the ends by means of approved
 permanent type anchoring assemblies.
 Use anchorage devices for post-tensioning that hold the prestressing steel at a load
 producing a stress of not less than 95 percent of the guaranteed ultimate tensile strength
 (GUTS) of the prestressing steel, when tested in an unbonded state, without exceeding the
 anticipated set.
 Distribute the load from the anchoring assemblies to the concrete by means of approved
 devices or bearing plates that will effectively distribute the load to the concrete. Construct the
 bearing plate and wedge plate from ferrous metal. For bending stresses in the bearing plates
 or assemblies induced by the pull of the prestressing steel, do not exceed the yield point of
 the material or cause visible distortion in the bearing plate when 95 percent of the GUTS of
 the tendons is applied as determined by the Engineer. Do not exceed 3500 psi directly
 underneath the bearing plate or assembly for the final unit compressive stress on the
 concrete.
 Galvanize the body of the anchorage assembly in accordance with AASHTO M 111. Other
 components of the anchorage assembly including wedges, wedge plate and local zone
 reinforcement need not be galvanized.
 Construct anchorage assemblies with grout vents suitable for post-grouting inspection access
 as approved by the Engineer. Equip all anchorages with a grout cap that is vented and bolted
 to the anchorage.
 Recess the anchoring assemblies so that the ends of the prestressing steel and all parts of
 the anchoring assemblies will be at least 3 inches inside of the end surface of the members,
 unless shown otherwise on the plans. After post-tensioning all tendons, fill the recesses with
 concrete conforming to the provisions for the structure and then finished flush with the
 abutment end diaphragm.
 2. Strand Couplers. Do not use strand couplers.
 3. Enclosures for Post-tensioning. Use rigid ferrous metal duct enclosures for prestressing steel
 that are galvanized, mortar tight, and capable of withstanding concrete pressures without
 deforming. Use rigid ducts with smooth inner walls that can be curved to the proper
 configuration without crimping or flattening and have sufficient strength to maintain their
 correct alignment during placing of concrete. Do not use semi-rigid ducts. Fabricate ducts
 with either welded or interlocked seams.
 
 488
 
 ALASKA 2017
 
 SECTION 721
 
 Connect sections of rigid ducts using galvanized ferrous metal couplings that are mortar tight
 and do not result in angle changes at the joints. Do not use split metal couplings. Use
 waterproof tape to seal all connections to the duct. Connect ducts to anchoring assemblies
 using transition couplings that are galvanized ferrous metal or polyethylene, mortar tight, and
 of sufficient strength to prevent displacement of the ducts during concrete placement.
 Use ducts for multi-strand tendons with a minimum diameter that provides an inside area at
 least 2.5 times the net area of the prestressing steel in the tendon.
 Do not use ducts with diameters that exceed 0.4 times the least gross concrete thickness at
 the duct location.
 Use duct enclosures with vents for the injection of grout after post-tensioning.
 4. Grout Vents. Use vents with positive means for allowing the escapement of air, water, grout,
 and bleed water out of the vents, injecting grout through the vents, and sealing to prevent
 grout leakage from the vents. Use 3/4 inch minimum diameter standard pipe or suitable
 plastic pipe vents with positive shut-off designed to withstand the grouting pressure. Do not
 crimp or bend the vent pipe. Use metallic or plastic structural fasteners to connect the vent
 with the duct. Do not use plastic components that react with the concrete or enhance
 corrosion of the prestressing steel, or contain water-soluble chlorides. Make all vents mortar
 tight, taped as necessary. Make vents with sufficient length out of the concrete member to
 allow proper closing of the vents. Remove ends of vents at least 1 inch below the roadway
 surface after grouting has been completed.
 Place vents at the following locations:
 a. At anchorages.
 b. At the high points of the duct, when the vertical distance between the highest and lowest
 point is more than 20 inches.
 c.
 
 At a location down flow from all high point vents where the duct is approximately one-half
 duct diameter lower than the crest, but not to exceed 3 feet downstream.
 
 d. At the lowest point of the duct.
 e. At major changes in the cross-section of the duct.
 f.
 
 At other locations designated by the Engineer.
 
 5. Grout Caps. Use grout caps that completely cover and seal all exposed ends of prestressing
 steel at the anchorage. Seal the cap with neoprene “O” ring seals and place a grout vent on
 the top of the cap. Use caps rated for a minimum pressure of 150 psi.
 721-2.04 CERTIFICATION.

 g. Countdown Module Functions.
 (1) General. Begin the countdown at the beginning of the FLASHING HAND indication.
 End the countdown at “0” at the end of the FLASHING HAND indication. Make the
 countdown display dark from the end of one FLASHING HAND indication until the
 beginning of the next. Display steady, not flashing, countdown digits. Do not provide
 user accessible switches, controls, or options that would allow modification of cycle
 time, icons, digits or that would allow the countdown to operate while the WALKING
 PERSON or STEADY HAND is displayed.
 (2) Learning Cycle. At power on, make the countdown display dark for one learning
 cycle in which it will determine the duration of the FLASHING HAND indication.
 (3) Normal Operation. Display the countdown/FLASHING HAND for the duration
 measured in the learning cycle for every cycle until the module measures a different
 FLASHING HAND duration.
 (4) Countdown Duration Modification. When a different duration is measured, make the
 countdown dark for the next cycle, and enter a Learning Cycle as previously
 described. Resume Normal Operation with the new FLASHING HAND duration if the
 measured FLASHING HAND duration for the next cycle is the same as for the first
 cycle when a change was detected. Continue Learning Cycles, if the duration is
 different, until the measured FLASHING HAND duration is the same for two cycles.
 Resume Normal Operation with the new duration when that happens.
 (5) Countdown Truncation. Make the digits dark if the controller output displays a
 STEADY HAND or if both the HAND and WALKING PERSON go dark, regardless of
 whether the countdown to zero has been completed.
 (6) Preemption. Handle preemption events as described under Countdown Duration
 Modification and, if necessary, Countdown Truncation.
 (7) Recycling. Allow for consecutive cycles without display of the STEADY HAND .
 (8) Power Outage. Maintain an uninterrupted countdown during short power failures
 (<1.5 seconds). Make the digits dark after a loss of power of more than 1.5 seconds
 and enter a Learning Cycle when the power is restored.
