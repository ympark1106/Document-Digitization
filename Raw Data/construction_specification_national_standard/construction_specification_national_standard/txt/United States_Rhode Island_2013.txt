 102.14 BIDDING CERTIFICATIONS.
 a. Non-Collusive Bidding Certification.
 1. The Certificates. Every Proposal submitted to the Department shall contain an
 Anti-Collusion Certificate for Contract and Force Account duly subscribed to and affirmed by the bidder
 as true under the penalties of law.
 2. Certifications. By submission of a Proposal, each bidder and each person signing the
 Proposal, which includes the Anti-Collusion Certificate on behalf of the bidder, certifies as to its own
 organization, under penalty of perjury, that to the best of their knowledge and belief:
 (a) The prices in this Proposal have been arrived at independently without collusion,
 consultation, communication, or agreement with any other bidder or with any competitor for the purpose
 of restricting competition.
 (b) Unless required by law, the prices which have been quoted in this Proposal have not been
 knowingly disclosed and will not knowingly be disclosed by the bidder, directly or indirectly, to any other
 bidder or competitor prior to opening of Proposals.
 (c) No attempt has been made or will be made by the bidder to induce any other person,
 partnership, or corporation to submit or not to submit a proposal for the purpose of restricting
 competition.
 3. Non-Compliance. The Quest Lite software will not enable a prospective bidder to complete
 the preparation of a Proposal unless the bidder certifies that he is in compliance with Paras. 2(a), 2(b),
 and 2(c) above.
 The fact that a bidder; (1) has published price lists, rates, or tariffs covering items being procured,
 (2) has informed prospective customers of proposed or pending publication of new or revised price lists
 for such items, or (3) has sold the same items to other customers at the same prices being bid, does not
 constitute a disclosure within the meaning of 2(a).
 The Proposal submitted to the Department will be considered as authorized by the board of
 directors of the bidder. Such authorization will be deemed to include the signing and submission of the
 Proposal and the inclusion therein of the certificate as to non-collusion on the part of the corporation.
 The signers of the Proposal hereby tender to the Department a statement that the named
 Contractor has not, either directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any collusion,
 or otherwise taken any action to restrain free competitive bidding in connection with the Proposal.
 b. Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters.
 1. The Certificate. Every Proposal submitted to the Department shall contain a Certification
 Regarding Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters, duly subscribed to and affirmed by
 the bidder as true under the penalties of law.
 2. Certification. By submission of a Proposal, each bidder and each person signing the
 Proposal, which includes the Debarment Certification on behalf of the bidder, certifies as to its own
 organization, under penalty of perjury, that to the best of their knowledge and belief:
 1−16
 
 (a) Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible or
 voluntarily excluded from covered transactions by any Federal department or agency;
 (b) Have not, within a three-year period preceding the submission of a Proposal been convicted of
 or had a civil judgment rendered for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with
 obtaining or performing a pubic contract or transaction;
 (c) Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental
 entity;
 (d) Have not, within the prior three-year period, had one or more public transactions terminated
 for cause or default.
 3. Non-Compliance. In the event a prospective bidder is unable to certify to one or more of the
 conditions above, the bidder must attach a list of exceptions to the hard copy proposal generated by the
 Quest Lite program. Exceptions listed will not necessarily result in denial of award, but will be
 considered in determining contractor responsibilities.
 The Quest Lite software allows a prospective bidder to either certify that he is in compliance with
 the provisions outlined in Paras. 2(a), (b), (c), and (d), above, or to not certify these provisions and
 instead provide with the Proposal a list of exceptions to document the reason(s) why he is unable to
 certify his compliance with these provisions. In the latter case, the software will generate a statement on
 the signature page of the Proposal that additional documentation is attached in support of the bidder’s
 inability to fully certify to the provisions.
 c. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Affirmative Action Certificate.
 1. The Certificate. For all contracts containing provisions for the participation of
 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs), prospective bidders shall be required to complete a
 Certification affirming compliance with the U.S. Department of Transportation and applicable State of
 Rhode Island regulations regarding participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in the contract as
 contractors, subcontractors and/or suppliers of materials and services.
 2. Certification. By submission of a Proposal, each bidder and each person signing a Proposal
 which includes the DBE Certification certifies that the organization shall affirmatively seek out and
 consider Disadvantaged Business Enterprises to participate in the contract, and develop and submit for
 approval to the Department, within ten days from the receipt of bids, a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
 Program in accordance with the provisions of the DBE Certification.
 3. Non-Compliance. The Quest Lite software will not enable a prospective bidder to complete
 the preparation of a bid Proposal unless the bidder completes the DBE Certification form in the Proposal.
 d. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.
 1. The Certificate. Every bidder shall be required to certify and disclose, through the bid
 preparation process, any lobbying of Federal agencies, employees, officers, Members of Congress, or
 officers or employees of Congress or Members of Congress in connection with a covered Federal action.
 2. Certification. By submission of a Proposal, each bidder and each person signing a Proposal
 certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
 1−17
 
 (a) No Federal appropriated funds have or will be paid, by or on behalf of the prospective bidder,
 to any individual or entity for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence any Federal agency,
 employee or officer thereof in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of a
 Federal grant or load, or any other form of a contractual nature.
 (b) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid for the purpose of
 influencing any Federal agency, employee or officer thereof, the prospective bidder shall complete and
 submit as part of the bid Proposal submission, Standard Form LLL “Disclosure Form to Report
 Lobbying” in accordance with its instructions.
 The prospective bidder also acknowledges by submitting a bid Proposal that the requirements of
 this certification shall also apply to all lower tier subcontracts which exceed $100,000, and that all
 subcontractors shall certify and disclose accordingly.
 3. Non-Compliance. The Quest Lite software will not enable a prospective bidder to complete
 the preparation of a bid Proposal unless the bidder certifies that he has met the requirements of Paras. 2
 (a) and (b), above. In order to complete a bid Proposal, the bidder is required to certify that no Federal
 appropriated funds have been used for lobbying purposes, to certify whether other sources of funds have
 been used for lobbying and if so, to report this activity on Standard Form LLL, which is included in the
 Quest Lite software.
 
 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT
 
 103.01 CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS. After the Proposals are opened and read, they will be
 compared on the basis of the summation of the products of the estimated quantities shown in the Proposal
 by the unit bid prices. The results of such comparisons will be made available to the public.
 The State reserves the right to correct arithmetic errors in the Proposals prior to comparison of
 said Proposals. In the event of a discrepancy between unit bid prices and extensions, the unit bid price
 shall govern.
 The State reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals, to waive technicalities or to advertise
 for new Proposals.
 
 103.02 POST-QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND AWARD OF CONTRACT.
 a. Submission of Post Qualification Requirements. All post qualification requirements shall
 be submitted as specified in the Contract Documents. This includes, but is not limited to, all
 documentation and requirements referenced under Part II: ACTION REQUIRED BY CONTRACTOR,
 as contained in the Special Provision entitled, "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Affirmative Action
 Certification for Contractors and Consultants." This Special Provision is located in the section of the
 Contract Documents entitled REQUIRED CONTRACT PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL-AID
 PROJECTS.
 
 1−18
 
 As part of the post qualification submission, the Contractor must designate on the
 Transportation Management Plan the Contractor’s TMP Implementation Manager for the Contract. The
 Contractor’s TMP Implementation Manager, together with the Department’s TMP Implementation
 Manager are the persons with the primary responsibility and authority for implementation of the
 Transportation Management Plan.

 financial statements certified by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). For contracts valued at $500,000
 and under, the successful bidder is required to submit only its financial references and an original copy of
 its current financial statement.
 c. Award of Contract. Contract award, if it be awarded, will be made within sixty (60) calendar
 days following the opening of Proposals, or within the time specified in the Notice to Contractors, to the
 lowest responsible and qualified bidder who submits the lowest responsive Proposal.
 The successful bidder will first receive a Notice of Tentative Award. This written
 communication will indicate the conditional intention of the State to award the Contract and instruct the
 successful bidder to arrange for the execution of the Contract Agreement and Contract Bond and for the
 delivery of the Certificates of Insurance, all as hereinafter provided.
 On Contracts jointly bid, Contractors will be held jointly and severally liable for the entire
 Contract.
 Corporate bidders must furnish documentary evidence that they have met all legal requirements
 to transact business in the State of Rhode Island as a condition precedent to approval of the Contract.
 
 103.03 CANCELLATION OF AWARD. Both the Department and Division of Purchases reserve the
 right to cancel the award of any Contract before the execution thereof by all parties without any liability
 against the State.
 
 103.04 RETURN OF PROPOSAL GUARANTY. The State reserves the right to retain the surety of
 all bidders until either the successful bidder enters into the Contract or until such time as the award or
 cancellation of the Contract is announced. At this point sureties will be returned to all bidders.
 A Contractor will not be released from the bidding obligation because of an alleged error in the
 preparation of the Proposal unless the State returns the Contractor's Proposal Guaranty.
 
 103.05 CONTRACT BOND. At the time of the execution of the Contract, the successful bidder shall
 furnish a Contract Bond in a sum equal to the full amount of the Contract. The Contract Bond shall
 guarantee the following; complete performance of the Contract; full payment for all materials and
 equipment; and full payment of all wages of labor.
 The form of the Contract Bond shall be acceptable to both the Department and the Division of
 Purchases. In the event the surety fails or becomes financially insolvent, the successful bidder shall file a
 new Bond in the amount designated by the Department within thirty (30) days of such failures or
 insolvency.
 
 1−19
 
 The Bond submitted to the Department shall be provided by a surety both acceptable to the
 Department and licensed and authorized to conduct business in the State of Rhode Island. All surety
 companies must be listed with the Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Services, Circular 570, (Latest
 Revision published by the Federal Register). Subsequent to award of Contract, the Department or
 Division of Purchases may call for additional security as required. Changes, additions, and modifications
 to the Contract may be made without the consent of surety.
 
 103.06 EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF THE CONTRACT. The Contract shall be executed by
 the successful bidder, hereinafter referred to as the Contractor, in accordance with the instructions
 contained in the Notice of Tentative Award. At the specified time and place, the Contractor shall deliver
 the Contract Bond and required Certificates of Insurance, execute the Contract Agreement, and comply
 with all other stipulations set forth in said notice.
 Receipt by the Contractor of the executed Contract Agreement and a Purchase Order signed by
 the Director of the Department and/or the Purchasing Agent and the State Controller constitutes the
 official "Award" of the Contract.
 The Contract execution date may be extended by mutual agreement of the Department and the
 successful bidder.
 
 103.07. FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT.
 a. Failure of State to Execute Contract. If the Contract is not executed within fifteen (15)
 calendar days following execution of the Contract Agreement and Bond by the Contractor, said
 Contractor shall have the right to withdraw its Proposal without penalty.
 b. Failure of the Bidder to Execute Contract. Failure of the successful bidder to execute the
 Contract Agreement and Contract Bond, deliver the required Certificates of Insurance; and comply with
 other stipulations within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the Notice of Tentative Award shall be
 considered revocation of said notice and require forfeiture of the Proposal Guaranty to the State. Such
 forfeiture shall not be considered a penalty, but rather a liquidation of damages sustained by the State.
 Furthermore, the Department will not issue or receive subsequent proposals for construction work
 from a bidder who fails to execute a Contract until said bidder demonstrates its ability to obtain the
 necessary bonding and insurance coverage to the complete satisfaction of the Department.
 In the event a Contract is not executed with the first-designated responsible bidder, the
 Department may either award the Contract to the next lowest responsible bidder or reject all bids and
 readvertise the Project for the purpose of soliciting new Proposals.
 103.08 ESCROW OF BID DOCUMENTATION. The placing in escrow of bid documentation in
 accordance with this Section shall be required only when specifically called for in the Notice to
 Contractors. Otherwise, this Section shall not apply.
 a. Scope and Purpose. The purpose of this Specification is to preserve the bid documents of the
 Contractor for use by the parties in any claims or litigation between the Department and Contractor
 arising out of this Contract.
 
 1−20
 
 The Contractor shall submit to the Department a legible copy of bid documentation used to
 prepare the bid for this Contract. Such documentation shall be placed in escrow with a banking institution
 or other bonded document storage facility and preserved by that institution/facility as specified in the
 following Sections of this clause.
 b. Submittal and Return of Bid Documentation. Prior to execution of the Contract, the
 Contractor shall submit to the Department the required bid documentation in a sealed container. The
 container shall be clearly marked "Bid Documentation" and shall also show on the face of the container
 the Contractor's name and address, the date of submittal, the Project Number, the Contract Number, and
 Project Name.
 c. Affidavit. In addition to the bid documentation, the Contractor shall submit an affidavit,
 signed under oath by a representative of the Contractor authorized to execute bidding proposals, listing
 each bid document submitted by author, date, nature, and subject matter. The affidavit shall attest that the
 affiant has personally examined the bid documentation, that the affidavit lists all of the documents relied
 upon by the Contractor in preparing its bid for this project, and that all such bid documentation is
 included in the submission to the Department.
 d. Duration and Use. The Department and the Contractor will jointly deliver the sealed
 container and affidavit to a banking institution or other bonded document storage facility selected by the
 Department for placement in a safety deposit box, vault or other secure accommodation.
 The agreement with the document depository shall reflect that the bid documentation and
 affidavit shall remain in escrow during the life of the Contract or until the Contractor notifies the
 Department of his intention to file a claim or initiate litigation against the Department related to the
 Contract. Notification of the Contractor's intention to file a claim, or initiation of litigation against the
 Department, shall be sufficient grounds for the Department to obtain the release and custody of the bid
 documentation. In the absence of such action and provided that the Contractor has signed the final
 Standard Release Form, the Department shall instruct the document depository to release the sealed
 container to the Contractor.
 In accordance with its representation that the sealed container placed in escrow contains all of the
 materials relied upon by the Contractor in preparing its bid, the Contractor agrees to waive its right to use
 any bid documentation other than that placed in escrow in disputes arising out of this Contract.
 e. Refusal or Failure to Provide Bid Documentation. Failure to provide bid documentation in
 accordance with the requirements of this Section shall be considered revocation of the notice of award
 and forfeiture of the Proposal Guaranty to the State.
 f. Confidentiality of Bid Documentation. The bid documentation and affidavit in escrow are,
 and will remain, the property of the Contractor. The Department has no interest in, or right to, the bid
 documentation unless notification of the intention to file claim is received or litigation ensues between the
 Department and Contractor. In the event of such notification or litigation, the bid documentation and
 affidavit shall become the property of the Department; provided, however, that these materials, and all
 copies made by the Department, shall be returned to the Contractor at the conclusion of litigation, or final
 resolution of all outstanding claims, upon execution of a final release. Moreover, the Department shall
 make every reasonable effort to insure that bid documentation to which it has gained access will remain
 confidential within the Department and will not be made available to anyone outside the Department, or
 used by a former Department employee.
 
 1−21
 
 g. Cost and Escrow Instructions. The cost of the escrow will be borne by the Department. The
 Department will provide escrow instructions to the document depository consistent with this clause.
 There will be no separate payment for compilation of the data, container or cost of verification of
 the bid documentation. All costs shall be included in the overall Contract bid price.
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 104.01 INTENT OF CONTRACT. The intent of the Contract is to provide for the construction and
 completion in every detail of the work as described. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials,
 equipment, tools, transportation and supplies required to complete the work, all in accordance with the
 Plans, Specifications and terms of the Contract.
 
 104.02 CHANGES IN THE CONTRACT.
 a. Right to Change. The Engineer reserves the right to make changes in the Contract at any
 time during the progress of the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the Project. Such changes
 shall not invalidate the Contract nor release the Surety. The Contractor agrees to perform the work as
 directed by the Engineer. Any costs applicable to such changes will be paid for by the execution of an
 appropriate Contract Modification.
 b. Causes for Changes. Changes in the Contract may result from any of the following causes:
 1. Differing site conditions.
 2. Alterations in the Plans or Details; additions to, reductions in, or elimination of an existing
 item of work contained in the Proposal.
 3. Extra or unforeseen work for which there is no item of work in the Proposal.
 4. Suspension of the work for which delay damages are reasonable.
 5. Significant changes in the character of the work.
 
 104.03 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS. During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent
 physical conditions are encountered at the site differing materially from those indicated in the Contract or
 if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily
 encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the Contract, are
 encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in
 writing of the specific differing conditions before the site is disturbed and before the affected work is
 performed.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that
 the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the
 performance of any work under the Contract, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profits, will be made
 1−22
 
 and the Contract modified in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the
 determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the
 Contractor has provided the required written notice.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any effects caused on unchanged
 work.
 
 104.04 ALTERATIONS IN THE PLANS OR DETAILS. The Engineer may order changes in the
 Plans or Details, increase, reduce, or eliminate any Contract work item deemed necessary to satisfactorily
 complete the Project. Should such alterations in the Contract result in changes in the quantities of work to
 be performed, the Contractor shall complete such altered quantities in the same manner prescribed for the
 corresponding unaltered quantities. Unless otherwise provided for under Subsection 104.07; Significant
 Changes in the Character of the Work, such altered work shall be paid for at the same unit prices as for
 the corresponding unaltered items of work.
 a. Prefabricated Materials. The Engineer may find it necessary to decrease or eliminate items
 of work that involve prefabricated materials which are not considered stock commercial items. In the
 event fabrication of such materials was started or completed before the Contractor is advised of the
 decrease or elimination of the items in question, the Department may:
 1. Upon verification, reimburse the Contractor for the fabrication cost, including material cost
 less salvage value; or
 2. Instruct the Contractor to have the fabricated material delivered to the project to be placed in
 the care of the Engineer for subsequent use by the State on other work. Payment for such material will be
 made in accordance with Subsection 109.06; Partial Payments.
 
 104.05 EXTRA WORK. The Contractor shall perform extra work, for which there is no price included
 in the Contract, whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable to complete the work as contemplated.
 Such work shall be performed in accordance with the Specifications and as directed, and will be paid for
 as provided under Subsection 109.04; Differing Site Conditions, Changes, Extra Work, and Force
 Account Work.
 
 104.06 SUSPENSIONS OF WORK ORDERED BY THE ENGINEER. If the performance of all or
 any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the Engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of
 time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the Contractor
 believes that additional compensation and/or Contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay,
 the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for adjustment within seven calendar days
 of receipt of the notice to resume work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such
 adjustment.
 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's request. If the Engineer agrees that the
 cost and/or time required for the performance of the Contract has increased as a result of such suspension
 and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its
 suppliers, or subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the Engineer will make an
 1−23
 
 adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the Contract in writing accordingly. The Contractor will be
 notified of the Engineer's determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the request for
 adjustment within the time prescribed.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would
 have been suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided for or
 excluded under any other term or condition of this Contract.
 
 104.07 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK. The Engineer reserves
 the right to make in writing at any time during the work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in
 the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and
 alterations shall not invalidate the Contract nor release the surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform
 the work as altered.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the
 Contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the
 work or by affecting other work cause such other work to become significantly different in character, an
 adjustment, excluding anticipated profits, will be made to the Contract. The basis for the adjustment shall
 be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an
 adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may
 determine to be fair and equitable.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to
 be performed under the Contract, the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the Contract.
 a. Circumstances for Significant Change. The term "significant change" shall be construed to
 apply only to the following circumstances:
 1. When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that
 involved or included in the original proposed construction or;
 2. When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the Contract, is increased in excess of 125
 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original Contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in
 quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 percent of original Contract item quantity, or in
 case of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual amount of work performed.
 
 104.08 MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall maintain the
 road undergoing improvement open to all traffic during the work of the Contract. Where so provided on
 the Plans, the Contractor may bypass traffic over an approved detour route. Additional detours not shown
 on the Plans may be employed only if plans for the detours are designed, submitted, reviewed, approved,
 and implemented in accordance with the requirements indicated in the Transportation Management Plan
 and such plans receive the written approval of the local City/Town Public Works Director. Detours of a
 short-term nature, which may be implemented only during the Contractor’s scheduled hours of operation,
 and which must be removed at the close of the day’s operations, shall require a 24-hour advance notice
 and approval of the Engineer. The Contractor shall keep the portion of the project being used by public
 traffic, whether it be through or local traffic, in a condition that shall safely and adequately accommodate
 1−24
 
 such traffic. The Contractor shall furnish, erect and maintain all temporary traffic control devices in
 accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, latest Edition.
 The Contractor shall bear all expense of maintaining traffic over the section of road undergoing
 improvement without direct compensation, except as provided below:
 a. Special Detours.
 When the Contract contains items for "maintenance of detours" or
 "removing existing structures and maintaining traffic," the payment for such items shall cover all cost of
 constructing and maintaining detour or detours, including the construction of temporary bridges and
 accessory features and the subsequent legal removal of the same. The failure or refusal of the Contractor
 to construct detours at the proper time and to maintain same in working condition shall be sufficient cause
 for suspending the work until such detours are provided in satisfactory condition for use by public traffic.
 Right-of-way for temporary roads or bridges will be furnished by the Department.
 b. Maintenance of Traffic During Suspension of Work. During any suspension of the work,
 the Contractor shall make passable and shall open to traffic those sections of the project, together with
 temporary roadways or portions thereof as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Engineer,
 for the temporary accommodation of traffic during the anticipated period of suspension. Thereafter, and
 until an issuance of an order for the resumption of construction operations, the maintenance of the
 temporary roadways and sections of the project will be the responsibility of the Department. When work
 is resumed, the Contractor shall replace or renew any work or materials lost or damaged because of such
 temporary use of the project; remove to the extent directed by the Engineer any work or materials used in
 the temporary maintenance thereof by the State; and complete the project in every respect as though its
 prosecution had been continuous and without interferences. Additional work caused by such suspension,
 for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor, will be paid for by the State in accordance with
 Subsection 109.04; Differing Site Conditions, Changes, Extra Work and Force Account Work.
 c. Maintenance Directed by the Engineer. If the Engineer directs special maintenance for the
 benefit of the traveling public, then the Contractor will be paid on the basis of prevailing unit prices or in
 accordance with Subsection 104.05; Extra Work. The Engineer will be the sole judge of work to be
 classed as special maintenance.
 Detours or routes used exclusively by the Contractor for hauling materials and equipment shall be
 constructed and maintained at its own expense. In order to provide for the safety, comfort, and well-being
 of residents of heavily populated residential areas, the Contractor shall select haul routes between the
 project and material sources that will minimize disturbance to such residents. The Contractor shall submit
 for the Engineer's review its planned route of haul and its plan for minimizing the adverse effect of such
 hauling operations on local residents. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain all
 necessary permits, approvals and licenses and to comply with the ordinances, rules and regulations of the
 local community concerning haul routes and detours, all at no expense to the Department.
 The Department reserves the right to select alternative haul routes, to divide the hauling traffic
 over several routes, and to impose such other restrictions it deems necessary to minimize the impact of the
 hauling operation on local residents.
 The Contractor shall not store barricades, material, or equipment in a manner that would impede
 or impair the safety of the traveling public.
 d. Maintenance for Traffic Flow-Utility Work. The Contractor shall provide, as part of the
 Contract, construction signing in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for all
 utility work performed directly by utility companies, municipalities, or their respective subcontractors.
 1−25
 
 Also included is the provision by the Contractor of flaggers, traffic persons, and the setting up,
 maintaining, and moving of signs, all in accordance with applicable provisions contained in PART 900 of
 these Standard Specifications.
 
 104.09 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ACCESS. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall
 maintain existing streets, highways, roads, private walks and sidewalks which may be involved with the
 Project, open for vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic. The Contractor shall also provide and maintain in a
 safe condition temporary approaches, crossings, and intersections with trails, roads, streets, businesses,
 parking lots, residences, garages, farms, and other features as may be necessary, and at its own expense
 and as directed by the Engineer.
 With respect to maintaining public access as described above, the Contractor will not be required
 to remove snow.
 If the Engineer decides that the interests of the public and/or abutting property owners so require,
 the Contractor shall construct plank crossings, or other such approved temporary crossings, over trenches
 in streets, roads, or private ways. All such temporary crossings shall be provided as directed by the
 Engineer.
 
 104.10 RIGHTS IN AND USE OF MATERIALS FOUND ON THE PROJECT. The Contractor,
 with the approval of the Engineer, may use on the project such stone, gravel, sand, or other material
 determined suitable by the Engineer, as may be found in the excavation and will be paid both for the
 excavation of such materials at the corresponding Contract unit price and for the pay item for which the
 excavated material is used. The Contractor shall replace at its own expense with other acceptable
 material all of that portion of the excavation material so removed and used which was needed for use in
 the embankments, backfills, approaches, or otherwise. No charge for the materials so used will be made
 against the Contractor. The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material from within the
 highway location which is not within the grading limits, as indicated by the slope and grade lines, without
 prior written authorization from the Engineer.
 
 104.11 FINAL CLEANING-UP. Prior to any inspections performed subsequent to the Contractor’s
 “Notice of Substantial Completion,” all areas occupied by the Contractor in connection with the work
 shall be cleaned of all rubbish, excess materials, temporary structures, and equipment. All parts of the
 work shall be left in an acceptable condition.
 The cost of the final clean-up shall be incidental to other items of work and no separate payment
 shall be made.
 The Contractor shall remove its equipment, materials and other obstacles from the project
 right-of-way and from property adjacent to the project site which is not owned or controlled by the
 Contractor within thirty (30) days after completion of the Project. The Contractor shall clean and remove
 all cement streaks or drippings, paint smears or drippings, rust stains, oil, grease, bituminous materials,
 dirt, and other foreign materials on or in any structure, curb, gutter, median or gore marker due to its
 operation.
 
 1−26
 
 104.12 RAILWAY-HIGHWAY PROVISIONS. If the Contract requires that materials be hauled
 across the tracks of any railway, the Department will arrange with the railway for new crossings or for the
 use of any existing crossings. If the Contractor elects to use crossings other than those specified in the
 Contract, the Contractor shall make arrangements for the use of the crossings.
 Work to be performed by the Contractor on the railway Right-of-Way shall be performed to avoid
 interference with the movement of trains or traffic of the railway company. The Contractor shall avoid
 accidents, damage, or unnecessary delay or interference with railway trains and other property.
 
 104.13 CONSTRUCTION OVER OR ADJACENT TO NAVIGABLE WATERS. Work over, on, or
 adjacent to navigable waters shall be so conducted so that free navigation of the waterways will not be
 interfered with and that the existing navigable depths will not be impaired except as allowed by permit
 issued by the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as applicable.
 
 104.14 CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WORK. Until substantially complete, the
 Contractor shall be responsible and shall protect all work against injury or damage from all causes
 whether arising from the execution or the non-execution of the work. At the Contractor's expense, the
 Contractor shall rebuild, repair, restore, and make good all losses, injuries, or damages to any portion of
 the work from any cause except those beyond the control of and without the fault or negligence of the
 Contractor, including but not restricted to acts of God, such as earthquake, tidal wave, tornado, hurricane,
 or other cataclysmic phenomenon of nature, or acts of the public enemy or of governmental authorities.
 In case of suspension of work from any cause whatsoever, the Contractor shall be responsible for
 the project and shall take such precaution as may be necessary to prevent damage to the project, provide
 for normal drainage and shall erect any necessary temporary structures, signs, or other facilities at its
 expense. During such period of suspension of work, the Contractor shall properly and continuously
 maintain in an acceptable growing condition all living material in newly established plantings, seedings,
 and soddings furnished under his Contract, and shall take adequate precautions to protect new tree growth
 and other important vegetative growth against injury.
 All costs associated with the work described in this Subsection shall be borne by the Contractor,
 unless otherwise provided, under Subsection 104.03; Differing Site Conditions.
 
 104.15 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and
 local laws and regulations controlling pollution of the environment. Pollution of streams, lakes, ponds,
 and reservoirs with fuels, oils, bitumens, chemicals, or other harmful materials, and pollution of the
 atmosphere from particulate and gaseous matter shall be avoided.
 When work areas or pits are located in or adjacent to live streams, such areas shall be separated
 from the main stream by a dike or barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream. Care shall be
 taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize siltation of the stream.
 Water from aggregate washing or other operations containing sediment shall be treated by
 filtration, settling basins, or other means sufficient to reduce the sediment content to not more than that of
 the stream or lake into which it is discharged.
 
 1−27
 
 Other requirements relating to temporary and permanent erosion and water pollution controls are
 set forth in SECTIONS 206 through 210, respectively, of these Specifications.
 a. Plant and Pest Control Requirements. The United States Department of Agriculture has
 advised that soil and soil-moving equipment operating in regulated areas of certain counties will be
 subject to plant and pest quarantine regulations. In general, these regulations provide for cleaning soil
 from equipment before it is moved from regulated areas. Complete information may be secured from
 appropriate divisions of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the United
 States Department of Agriculture.
 Contractors shall comply with these regulations where applicable to the State of Rhode Island.
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 105.01 AUTHORITY OF THE ENGINEER. The Engineer will decide all questions related to the
 quality and acceptability of materials furnished; work performed; and the rate of progress of the work;
 questions regarding the interpretation of the Contract Documents; and questions as to the acceptable
 fulfillment of the Contract by the Contractor.
 The Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work completely or in part due to the failure
 of the Contractor to correct conditions unsafe for the workers or the general public; for failure to carry out
 provisions of the Contract; for failure to carry out orders; for such periods necessary due to unsuitable
 weather; for failure to correct damages to public or private properties caused by the Contractor and/or its
 Subcontractors, for conditions considered unsuitable for the prosecution of the work or for any other
 condition or reason determined to be in the State's interest.
 
 105.02 PLANS AND SHOP DRAWINGS. Plans will show details of all structures, lines, grades,
 typical cross sections of the roadway, location and design of all structures and a summary of items
 appearing on the Proposal. Bridge plans will either show all dimensions and details necessary for
 complete construction or such information that when supplemented by additional field data gathered by
 the Contractor will enable the Contractor to prepare complete shop drawings.
 The Contractor shall keep one set of plans available at the site at all times, and shall provide
 approved shop drawings to the Engineer upon request.
 All shop drawings will be submitted in a timely fashion such that the Contractor’s approved
 schedule will not be adversely impacted by the submittal process. Shop drawings shall consist of such
 detailed plans required to control the work that are not included in the Plans furnished by the Department.
 They shall include, but not be limited to, stress sheets, erection plans, falsework plans, sheeting plans,
 cofferdam plans, bending diagrams for reinforcing steel or any other supplementary plans or similar data
 required of the Contractor. The Contractor shall submit eight (8) sets of shop drawings to the Engineer
 and one set to the design consultant of record. Shop drawings shall be accompanied by eight (8) sets of
 design computations, cuts from manufacturers' catalogs, and/or supporting technical bulletins.
 
 1−28
 
 Engineering shop drawings and design computations shall be stamped only by a Rhode Island
 Registered Professional Engineer. The stamping of Plans for professional design shall be in accordance
 with the applicable requirements of the Rhode Island Board of Registration for Professional Engineers, or
 other Boards of Professional Registration, as applicable.
 Within forty-five (45) calendar days of submission, all shop drawings shall be reviewed by the
 Engineer and returned to the Contractor for appropriate action. Shop drawings that are found to be
 erroneous, lacking information necessary to control construction, or not in conformance with accepted
 design criteria will be disapproved and returned to the Contractor. The Contractor shall address the
 Engineer's comments and resubmit revised shop drawings and/or design computations. The Contractor
 will not be allowed any increase in Contract time for the time taken by the Contractor to submit revised
 shop drawings caused by an erroneous submission, or by a previous submission either lacking the
 information necessary to control construction, or not conforming to accepted design criteria. Also, the
 time taken by the Engineer to review the revised shop drawings does not constitute justification for
 additional Contract time.
 Shop drawings must be approved by the Engineer prior to performance of the work involved.
 Such approval shall not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility under the Contract for the successful
 completion of the work.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents, the Contract price will include the cost of
 furnishing all shop drawings.
 
 105.03 CONFORMITY WITH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS. Work performed and materials
 furnished shall be in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions and
 material requirements, including tolerances, specified in the Contract Documents.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials furnished, work performed or the finished product
 are not in reasonably close conformity with the Contract Documents, but that reasonably acceptable work
 has been produced, THE Engineer will determine if the work should be accepted and remain in place. If
 accepted, the Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by Contract modification which will
 provide for an appropriate adjustment in the Contract price for such work or materials as necessary to
 support this determination.
 "Reasonably close conformity" means compliance with reasonable and customary manufacturing
 and construction tolerances where working tolerances are not specified. Where working tolerances are
 specified, reasonably close conformity means compliance with such working tolerances. Without
 detracting from the complete and absolute discretion of the Engineer to insist upon such tolerances as
 establishing reasonably close conformity, the Engineer may accept variations beyond such tolerances as
 reasonably close conformity where such variations will not materially affect the value or utility of the
 work or the interests of the State.
 
 105.04 COORDINATION OF PLANS, SPECIFICATIONS, SUPPLEMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS, AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS. The Standard Specifications, Supplemental Specifications,
 Plans, Special Provisions, and Contract Addenda are essential parts of the Contract; and a requirement
 occurring in one is as binding as though occurring in all. They are intended to be complementary and to
 describe and provide for a complete work. In case of discrepancy, calculated dimensions will govern over
 1−29
 
 scaled dimensions; Plans will govern over Standard and Supplemental Specifications; Supplemental
 Specifications will govern over Standard Specifi-cations; and Special Provisions will govern over
 Standard Specifications, Supplemental Specifi-cations and Plans.
 The Contractor shall take no advantage of any apparent error or omission in the Contract
 Documents. If the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, the Engineer shall be promptly
 notified. The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations necessary to fulfill the intent
 of the Contract Documents.
 
 105.05 COOPERATION BY CONTRACTOR. The Department will supply the Contractor with a
 Contract Award Booklet containing a Contract Award compact disk (CD), from which the plans,
 specifications, contract addenda and other contract documents may be printed. The Contractor will be
 required to keep one set of printed copies of the Contract Documents available on the project site at all
 times.
 The Contractor shall give the work the constant attention necessary to facilitate progress and shall
 cooperate fully with the Engineer, the Department's Resident Engineer and inspectors, and other
 Contractors.
 The Contractor shall have on the project site as its agent, a competent superintendent capable of
 reading and thoroughly understanding the Contract Documents and experienced in the type of work being
 performed. The superintendent shall receive orders or instructions from the Engineer, shall be authorized
 to act for the Contractor on the work, and shall have full authority to execute orders or directions of the
 Engineer without delay.
 The Contractor shall promptly supply, irrespective of the amount of work sublet, the necessary
 materials, equipment, tools, labor, and other incidentals to complete the Contract.
 a. Causes for Removal. The Engineer may remove the superintendent from the project at any
 time if:
 1. The performance of the superintendent is unsatisfactory; or
 2. The superintendent is uncooperative in his relationship with the Engineer.
 
 105.06 COOPERATION WITH UTILITIES. The Department will notify all utility companies, all
 pipe line owners, or other parties affected, and endeavor to have all necessary adjustments of public or
 private utility fixtures, pipe lines, and other appurtenances within or adjacent to the limits of construction,
 made as soon as practicable.
 Water lines, gas lines, wire lines, service connections, water and gas meter boxes, water and gas
 valve boxes, light standards, cableways, signals, and all other utility appurtenances within the limits of the
 proposed construction in which the respective owners hold no private easements are to be relocated or
 adjusted by said owners in accordance with executed Construction and Maintenance Agreements/Utilities.
 It is understood that the Contractor has considered in its Proposal all of the permanent and
 temporary utility facilities in their present or relocated positions as specified in the Contract and as
 revealed by site investigation. No additional compensation will be allowed the Contractor for any delays,
 1−30
 
 inconvenience, or damage sustained by it due to any interference caused by such facilities or the operation
 of relocating them, unless otherwise provided for in Subsection 104.03; Differing Site Conditions.
 In general, the Contract will indicate those various utility items which are to be relocated or
 adjusted by the utility owner in accordance with Construction and Maintenance Agreements, and those
 which are to be relocated or adjusted by the Contractor. In this latter case, all underground construction
 required under the Contract for new or existing electric and/or telephone related facilities shall be
 performed by a contractor approved by the respective utility company. The Contractor may perform this
 work if it has been so-approved; otherwise, the Contractor shall retain a firm that has been approved for
 such work. The work involved would include all adjustments to utility manholes, frames and grates, as
 well as the utility lines themselves. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the Contractor shall submit to
 the Engineer written statements from the respective utility companies that the firm or firms selected by
 the Contractor are approved for such work. See Special Provision Code 105.2000.
 Prior to commencing work, the Contractor shall make arrangements to protect the properties of
 railway, telegraph, telephone, water, gas, and power companies, or other property, from damage that
 could result in considerable expense, loss, or inconvenience.
 In addition, the Contractor shall notify each utility owner and/or municipality whose facilities
 might be affected by its work 24 hours in advance of the commencement of such work. This notification
 shall also request the respective utility owner and/or municipality to assign a representative to be present
 at the site of the work during the period of the Contractor's operations.
 The locations and depths of existing utilities as shown on the Plans are approximate and should
 not be relied upon by the Contractor. The Contractor shall check and verify the location of all existing
 utilities, both underground and overhead, before proceeding to commence the work or order materials.
 Excavation shall be in accordance with all statutes, ordinances, and regulations of the Municipality, State
 or Federal Government that may be applicable. The Contractor is specifically required to follow the Dig
 Safe process. Damage to existing utilities which are shown on the Plans or located by the respective
 utilities in accordance with the Dig Safe process shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall cooperate with the utility owners in the removal and rearrangement of any
 underground or overhead utilities in order that these operations may progress in a reasonable manner; that
 duplication of rearrangement work may be reduced to a minimum; and that services rendered by the
 utility owners will not be unnecessarily interrupted.
 In the event of interruption to water or utility services as a result of accidental breakage or of
 being exposed or unsupported, the Contractor shall promptly notify the proper authority and shall
 cooperate fully in the restoration of such services.
 If water service is interrupted, repair work shall be continuous until the service is restored. No
 work shall be undertaken around fire hydrants until provisions for continued service have been approved
 by the local fire authority.
 
 1−31
 
 The Contractor shall prevent damage to pipes, cables, and other utilities. Repairs to damaged
 utilities caused by carelessness or omissions on the Contractor's part will be corrected at the Contractor's
 expense. The damaged facilities shall be restored to a condition similar or equal to that existing before
 the damage occurred. If the Engineer determines that adjustment or relocation of utilities is necessary to
 accommodate construction, the Engineer will make necessary arrangements with the owner if the work is
 not otherwise provided for in the Contract.
 If the Engineer determines that adjustment of utility facilities is necessary to accommodate
 construction, and the adjustment work is not provided for in the Contract, the Contractor will be paid for
 the work in accordance with Subsection 109.04; Differing Site Conditions, Changes, Extra Work,
 and Force Account Work.
 a. Contractor Coordination with U.S. Postal Service. The Contractor shall notify and
 coordinate with the U.S. Postal Service in situations where existing U.S. Postal Boxes (mail
 drop/collection boxes) within the limits of the Contract are to be removed and reset to allow for
 sidewalk/curbing construction. This requirement applies only in the case of standard U.S. Postal Service
 main drop boxes; it is not applicable for the removal and resetting or replacement of private mailboxes.
 The removal and resetting of U.S. Postal Service mail drop boxes must be conducted only by the U.S.
 Postal Service, and therefore, a reasonable time allowance must be provided by the Contractor to allow
 the Postal Service to complete the removal prior to start of construction. Finally, the Contractor shall
 coordinate with the Post Office when construction is complete and acceptable such that the boxes may be
 reset.
 b. Contractor Coordination with Narragansett Bay Commission. The Contractor must
 obtain a sewer facility alteration permit from the Narragansett Bay Commission prior to undertaking any
 work that affects sanitary sewer facilities that fall within NBC jurisdiction. The permit will be issued
 through the NBC and can be obtained at the location indicated in Special Provision Code 105.1000 of
 the Contract.
 
 105.07 COOPERATION BETWEEN CONTRACTORS. The Department reserves the right to
 contract for, and perform other or additional work on or near the work covered by the Contract.
 When separate contracts are let within the limits of any one project, each Contractor shall conduct
 its work without interfering or hindering the progress or completion of the work being performed by other
 contractors. Contractors working on the same project shall cooperate with each other as directed by the
 Engineer.
 Each Contractor involved shall assume all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with its
 contract and shall protect and save harmless the Department from any and all damages or claims that may
 arise because of inconvenience, delay, or loss experienced because of the presence and operations of other
 contractors working within the limits of the same project unless otherwise provided for under Subsection
 104.03; Differing Site Conditions.
 The Contractor shall arrange the work and shall place and dispose of the materials being used
 without interfering with the operations of the other contractors within the limits of the same project. The
 work shall be coordinated with that of the others in an acceptable manner and shall be performed in
 proper sequence with that of the other contractors.
 1−32
 
 105.08 CONSTRUCTION STAKES, LINES, AND GRADES. The Contractor will set construction
 stakes establishing lines, slopes, profile grades, centerline and benchmarks for roadwork, bridge work,
 culvert work, protective and accessory structures, and appurtenances. These stakes and marks shall
 constitute the field control by which the Contractor shall establish other necessary controls and perform
 the work.
 The contractor will maintain construction lines, points and grade staking to assure accurate and
 proper control of the work and to verify final grades and construction lines. The Contractor shall be held
 responsible for preserving all stakes and marks, and if the stakes or marks are destroyed or disturbed by
 the Contractor, the responsibility of replacing them will be borne by the Contractor at his own expense.
 The Contractor will be responsible for the accuracy of lines, slopes, grades, and other engineering
 work set forth under the contract documents and the provisions of SECTION 934; FIELD CONTROL
 AND CONSTRUCTION LAYOUT.
 
 105.09 AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF RESIDENT ENGINEER. As the representative of the
 Engineer, the Resident Engineer has immediate charge of the engineering details of each construction
 project, and is responsible for the administration and satisfactory completion of the project. The Resident
 Engineer is delegated commensurate authority by the Department and is, thereby, authorized to reject
 defective material and to suspend any work that is being improperly performed. The Resident Engineer is
 authorized to make changes that involve increases or decreases in quantities not greater than ten-percent
 of the corresponding values that appear in the Proposal. The Resident Engineer is not authorized to make
 changes in any design element or project specification; or to make increases or decreases in quantities
 greater than ten-percent of the corresponding values that appear in the Proposal.
 
 105.10 INSPECTION OF WORK. All materials and each part or detail of the work shall be subject to
 inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer shall be allowed access to all parts of the work and shall be
 furnished with such information and assistance by the Contractor as is required to make a complete and
 detailed inspection.
 If requested by the Engineer, the Contractor, before acceptance of the work, shall remove or
 uncover such portions of the finished work as may be directed. After examination, the Contractor shall
 restore said portions of the work to the standard required by the Contract. Should the work thus exposed
 or examined prove acceptable, the uncovering, removing, and replacing the covering, or making good of
 the parts removed will be paid for as Extra Work. Should the work so exposed or examined prove
 unacceptable, the uncovering, removing, and replacing of the covering, or making good of the parts
 removed, shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 Work performed or materials used without supervision or inspection by an authorized Department
 representative as a result of failure of the Contractor to notify the Engineer may be ordered removed
 and/or replaced at the Contractor's expense.
 When any unit of government or political subdivision, utility or railroad corporation is required to
 accept and/or pay a portion of the cost of the work covered by this Contract, its representatives shall have
 the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall not make any unit of government or political
 1−33
 
 subdivision, utility, or railroad corporation a party to this Contract, and shall in no way interfere with the
 rights of either such party.
 105.11 REMOVAL OF UNACCEPTABLE AND UNAUTHORIZED WORK. Work which does
 not reasonably conform to the requirements of the Contract will be considered unacceptable, unless
 otherwise determined acceptable under the provisions of Subsection 105.03; Conformity with Plans
 and Specifications.
 Unacceptable work, whether the result of poor workmanship, use of defective materials, or
 damage through carelessness, found to exist prior to the final acceptance of the work, shall be removed
 immediately and replaced in an acceptable manner at the Contractor's expense.
 Work performed contrary to the instructions of the Engineer; work performed beyond the lines
 and grades shown on the Plans, or as otherwise provided; or any extra work performed without authority,
 will be considered as unauthorized work and will not be paid for under the provisions of the Contract.
 Work so performed may be ordered removed and/or replaced at the Contractor's expense.
 If the Contractor fails to promptly comply with any order of the Engineer made under the
 provisions of this Subsection, the Engineer is authorized to require unacceptable work to be remedied or
 removed and replaced, and unauthorized work to be removed, and to deduct the costs incurred thereby
 from any monies due or to become due the Contractor.
 
 105.12 LOAD RESTRICTIONS. The Contractor shall comply with all legal load restrictions in the
 hauling of equipment or materials on public roads beyond the limits of the project. A special permit will
 not relieve the Contractor of liability for damage which may result from the moving of such equipment or
 materials.
 The operation of equipment on hauling loads which cause damage to structures or the roadway, or
 to any other type of construction, will not be permitted. Handling or hauling of materials over the base
 course or surface course under construction shall be limited as directed by the Engineer to prevent
 damage to the pavement structure. No loads will be permitted on a concrete pavement, base or structure
 before the concrete has attained its required strength unless otherwise authorized in writing by the
 Engineer.
 
 105.13 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION. The Contractor shall maintain the work
 during construction and until the project is substantially complete. This maintenance shall constitute
 continuous and effective work prosecuted day by day, with adequate equipment and forces to the end that
 the roadway or structures are kept in satisfactory condition.
 If the Contract requires the placing of a course upon a course or subgrade previously constructed,
 the Contractor shall maintain the previous course or subgrade during all construction operations.
 Cost of maintenance work during construction and before the project is substantially completed is
 contained within the Contract unit prices of the various pay items and the Contractor will not be paid an
 additional amount.
 
 1−34
 
 105.14 OPENING SECTIONS OF PROJECT TO TRAFFIC. Opening of sections of the work to
 traffic prior to completion of the entire Contract may be desirable from a traffic service standpoint; or
 may be necessary due to conditions inherent in the work, or by changes in the Contractor's work schedule;
 or necessary due to conditions or events unforeseen at the time of the Contract award. Such openings to
 traffic shall be made when ordered by the Engineer. Under no condition shall the openings constitute
 acceptance of the work or a waiver of any provisions of the Contract.
 The Contract will state which sections shall be opened to traffic prior to completion of the
 Project. On any section opened by order of the Engineer, whether covered in the Contract or not, the
 Contractor shall not be required to assume any expense in maintaining the road for such traffic. Such
 expense will be borne by the Department, or compensated for in accordance with Subsection 109.04;
 Differing Site Conditions, Changes, Extra Work and Force Account Work.
 If, however, the Contractor is dilatory in completing shoulders, drainage structures, or other
 features of the work, the Engineer may notify the Contractor in writing and establish a period of time in
 which the work should be completed. If the Contractor is dilatory, or fails to make a reasonable effort
 toward completion in this period of time, the Engineer may order all or a portion of the project opened to
 traffic. On sections which are so ordered to be opened, the Contractor shall conduct the remainder of the
 construction operations to cause the least obstruction to traffic. Costs incurred due to the dilatory nature
 of the Contractor's response to instructions of the Engineer shall be borne solely by the Contractor.
 On any section opened to traffic under the above conditions, whether stated in the Contract or
 opened by necessity of Contractor's operations, or unforeseen necessity, damage to the highway not
 attributable to traffic that occurs (except slides) shall be repaired at the expense of the Contractor. The
 removal of slides shall be done by the Contractor on a basis determined by the Engineer prior to removal.
 Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall schedule pavement removal such that no location
 shall remain unpaved for longer than ten (10) working days. This means that once the Contractor
 commences with the removal of existing full depth pavement from any location where traffic flow is to be
 maintained, he must restore the roadway with no less than a full depth bituminous base course at that
 particular location within 10 working days. In the case of partial depth pavement removal (cold
 planning/milling), the Contractor shall schedule the pavement removal such that no location shall remain
 without a new bituminous asphalt layer for longer than seven (7) calendar days.
 
 105.15 FURNISHING RIGHT-OF-WAY. The Department is responsible for securing Rights-of-Way
 in advance of construction. Exceptions will be indicated in the Contract.
 
 105.16 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ROADWAY OR STRUCTURE. If the Contractor fails to
 comply with the provisions of Subsection 105.13; Maintenance During Construction, the Engineer
 will immediately notify the Contractor of such non-compliance.
 If the Contractor fails to remedy
 unsatisfactory maintenance within 24 hours after receipt of such notice, the Engineer may immediately
 proceed to maintain the project. The entire cost of this maintenance will be deducted from monies due or
 to become due the Contractor.
 
 1−35
 
 105.17 ACCEPTANCE.
 a. Partial Acceptance. When the Contractor substantially completes a unit or portion of the
 work in accordance with the definition contained in Subsection 101.71; Substantial Completion, the
 Contractor may request an inspection of that unit or portion of the project. The Engineer's inspection
 shall disclose the following:
 1. Work not started, but required to be completed.
 2. Incomplete work, the completion of which is required.
 3. Unsatisfactory work, the correction of which is required.
 The Engineer shall provide the Contractor with a report containing the results of this inspection
 along with instruction for completing the construction of the unit or portion of the work under
 consideration. The Contractor shall immediately comply with these instructions. Upon completing and
 correcting the work, the Contractor may request another inspection.
 If, upon completion of this second inspection, the Engineer finds that the unit or portion of the
 work has been satisfactorily completed in compliance with the Contract, the Engineer may accept that
 unit or portion of the work as physically completed, and the Contractor may be relieved of further
 responsibility for such unit or portion of the work, provided that the Contractor agrees to deliver full
 documentation, certificates and proofs of compliance for said work during final acceptance.
 If, however, during this second inspection the Engineer finds any incomplete or unsatisfactory
 work, no partial acceptance will be granted, and acceptance of the unit or portion of the work must await
 the final acceptance of the entire project.
 Partial acceptance shall not void or alter any of the terms or provisions of the Contract.
 b. Final Acceptance. Final acceptance of the project will be made by the Engineer on behalf of
 the State when the Contractor has completed the project in full accordance with the definition contained
 in Subsection 101.09; Completion. The procedure for obtaining final acceptance follows:
 1. When the Contractor determines that the work of the Contract is substantially completed in
 accordance with the definition of Subsection 12.101.71; Substantial Completion, the Contractor shall
 notify the Engineer of this fact.
 2. Within 30 calendar days of the Contractor's official notice, the Engineer will schedule a time
 and date for an inspection.
 3. The Engineer's inspection shall take place at the time and date established in subparagraph (2),
 above.
 4. Within 60 calendar days of the inspection, the Engineer will notify the Contractor, in writing,
 as to the following:
 (a) Any outstanding work items that remain to be completed.
 
 1−36
 
 (b) Any unsatisfactory work that must be corrected.
 (c) The required submission of any and all executed documents, certificates, or proofs of
 compliance as required by the Contract.
 Subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), above, constitute the Engineer's so-called, "punch list.”
 5. The Contractor shall complete the work, correct unsatisfactory work, submit the required
 documents, and comply with all directions contained in the Engineer's "punch list" within 60 calendar
 days of the date of the Engineer's transmittal to the Contractor of said "punch list" except that;
 If, during the progression of these 60 calendar days for the Contractor to complete the work, the
 date of December 15th is encountered, said progression of days shall stop, and shall not again be resumed
 until the date of the following April 15th is encountered, the intervening 120 days being designated as
 winter "shut down" time.
 6. At the conclusion of the 60 calendar days for the Contractor to complete the work, the
 progression of which is defined above, the Engineer shall make another inspection of the work. If the
 Engineer determines that the work of the Contract has been satisfactorily completed in full accordance
 with Subsection 101.09; Completion, such inspection shall constitute the Final Inspection. In such
 event, the Engineer will make final acceptance of the project on behalf of the State and shall notify the
 Contractor in writing of this acceptance as of the date of the aforementioned Final Inspection.
 If, however, this second inspection discloses that work remains to be completed, unsatisfactory
 work remains to be corrected, and documents remain to be submitted, the process will revert to that of
 Para. b.4, above, and proceed accordingly; with the additional stipulation that liquidated damages will
 commence on the date of the second inspection and will remain in effect until final acceptance is
 subsequently achieved, all as hereinafter provided for in Subsection 108.08; Failure to Complete on
 Time.
 
 105.18 CLAIMS FOR ADJUSTMENTS AND DISPUTES.
 a. Notification. If the Contractor deems that additional compensation is due for work or
 material not clearly covered in the Contract, the Contractor shall notify both the Engineer and the Chief
 of Construction Operations in writing of its intention to make claim for such additional compensation
 before beginning or continuing the affected work; also, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with
 performance of the contract pending final resolution of any request for relief, payment, claim, appeal or
 action arising under the contract, and comply with any decisions of the Engineer1. If such notification is
 not given, or the Contractor does not afford the Engineer proper facilities for keeping strict account of the

 If such efforts are unsuccessful, claims and disputes will be submitted to either binding arbitration or
 litigation for resolution in accordance with State Law.
 
 105.20 PROJECT DELAYS.
 a. General Conditions Concerning Delays. Given the nature and extent of costs arising out of
 work that has been delayed, and the intent of both the Contractor and the State to promptly assign
 responsibility for such delay and to have all associated costs as fully documented as possible, strict
 adherence to the provisions of this Subsection is a condition precedent to the Contractor's entitlement to
 additional compensation or an extension of time because of project delays.
 b. Notification of Delay. Within 30 calendar days of any Department action or omission which
 the Contractor believes has delayed or may delay the project, the Contractor shall notify the Resident
 Engineer of such a delay and indicate whether it intends to file a request for delay costs. The Contractor
 shall confirm such notification in writing to the Engineer within 5 calendar days of its notification to the
 Resident Engineer.
 c. Procedures. Upon notifying the Resident Engineer, the Contractor shall keep daily records of
 all non-salaried labor, material and equipment expenses for all operations that are allegedly affected by
 the delay. The Contractor shall also identify in the daily records each operation affected by the delay and
 the station location of each such operation. The Department will also keep daily records. Each Monday,
 the Contractor shall compare the previous week's daily records with those maintained by the Department.
 The Contractor shall report to the Engineer within 10 calendar days of each such comparison all
 disagreements with Department records.
 Failure to meet to review the Department's records or to report disagreements between the two
 sets of records will constitute the assumption that the Department's records are accurate.
 Delay costs allegedly incurred prior to notifying the Resident Engineer that operations have been
 delayed will not be allowed.
 1. Each Monday, the Contractor shall prepare and submit written reports to the Resident
 Engineer regarding alleged delays which contain the following information:
 
 1−40
 
 (a) Number of days behind schedule.
 (b) Identify all operations that have been delayed, or will be delayed.
 (c) Explain how the Department's act or omission delayed each operation, and estimate the
 amount of time required to complete the project.
 (d) Itemize all extra costs being incurred, with explanations for each such cost.
 2. Within 15 calendar days of the termination of an alleged delay, the Contractor shall submit a
 report to both the Resident Engineer and the Engineer containing the following information:
 (a) A description of the operations that were delayed. Documentation and explanation of how
 the Department caused the delay to include the reports of all scheduling experts or other consultants, if
 any; and
 (b) An as-built chart, or other graphic depiction of how the operations were delayed.
 (c) An item-by-item calculation and explanation of extra costs being sought.
 3. The Engineer will review the Contractor's submission and any reports prepared by the
 Resident Engineer. A written decision will be provided to the Contractor within 60 days of the receipt of
 the Contractor's submission. If the Engineer determines that the Department is responsible for delays to
 the Contractor's operations, an equitable adjustment to the Contract will be authorized in accordance with
 Subsection 109.10; Compensation for Project Delays.
 
 105.21 WORK ZONE TRAINING. The Contractor’s TMP Implementation Manager and all other
 Contractor/Subcontractor personnel responsible for the setup, operation, maintenance, inspection,
 movement and/or breakdown of temporary traffic control devices shall be trained in accordance with the
 Department’s “Training Guidelines for Personnel Responsible for Work Zone Safety & Mobility” and
 shall possess a certificate of satisfactory completion of such training. Training shall be at a level
 appropriate to the individual’s job responsibilities and to the job decisions the individual is required to
 make and shall be completed prior to the commencement of work.
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIAL
 
 106.01 SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. Materials used on the work
 shall meet all quality requirements of the Contract and the “Master Schedule for the Preparation of a
 Project Schedule for Sampling, Testing, and Certification of Materials. In order to expedite the inspection
 and testing of materials, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer of the proposed sources of materials
 prior to delivery. At the option of the Engineer, materials may be approved at the source of supply before
 delivery is started. If, after trial, it is found that sources of supply which have been approved do not
 produce a reasonably uniform product, or if the product from any source proves unacceptable at any time,
 1−41
 
 the Contractor shall furnish materials from other sources. All materials shall be new unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract.
 No material which, after approval, has become unfit for use shall be employed in the work.
 The Department reserves the right to retest all materials which have been previously tested and
 accepted at the source of supply and delivered to the site. However, prior to incorporation into the work
 the Department may reject all such materials which, when retested, do not reasonably meet the
 requirements of these Specifications, or those established for the specific project.
 a. Buy American Requirements for Domestic Steel. In accordance with the U.S. Code of
 Federal Regulations Title 23 and Section 165 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, only
 such permanently incorporated steel materials as have been manufactured in the United States will be
 used on all projects. Further, any pig iron and/or pelletized and reduced iron ore, used to produce
 permanently incorporated steel materials or permanently incorporated non-steel products, must be
 manufactured in the United States.
 Bidders are advised that the Contract will be awarded to the bidder who submits the lowest total
 bid based on furnishing domestic steel materials.
 1. Certification of Steel. All manufacturing processes of the steel material in a project (i.e.,
 smelting, and any subsequent process which alters the steel material’s physical form or shape or changes
 its chemical composition) must occur within the United States to be considered of domestic origin. This
 includes processes such as rolling, extruding, machining, bending, grinding, drilling and the application
 of coatings, including iron.
 2. Minimal Use of Foreign Steel. Section 635.410(b)(4) of Title 23 CFR permits a minimal
 amount of foreign steel to be incorporated into a Federal-aid project. This amount is defined as one-tenth
 of one percent (0.1 percent) of the total contract cost or $2,500, whichever is greater. The cost of the
 foreign steel is defined as its value delivered to the project.
 
 106.02 LOCAL MATERIAL SOURCES. Possible sources of local materials may be designated on
 the Plans and described in the Special Provisions. In general, the quality of material in such deposits will
 be acceptable. However, the Contractor shall determine the amount of equipment and work required to
 produce a material meeting the requirements of these Specifications. The Contractor shall understand that
 it is not feasible to ascertain from samples the limits for an entire deposit, and that variations shall be
 considered as usual and are to be expected. The Engineer may order procurement of material from any
 portion of a deposit and may reject other portions of the deposit as unacceptable.
 The Department may acquire and allow the Contractor to take materials from sources designated
 on the Plans and/or as specified in the Special Provisions. The Department may also allow the Contractor
 to use such other property as may be specified, for plant site, stockpiles and hauling roads.
 If the Contractor desires to use material from sources other than those designated, the Contractor
 shall acquire the necessary rights to take materials from the sources and shall pay all costs related thereto,
 including any which may result from an increase in length of haul. All costs of exploring and developing
 such other sources shall be borne by the Contractor. The use of material from other than designated
 1−42
 
 sources will not be permitted until representative samples taken by the Engineer have been approved and
 written authority is granted for the use thereof.
 When material deposits are neither described in the Special Provisions nor designated on the
 Plans, the Contractor shall provide sources of material acceptable to the Engineer.
 When sources of material or material deposits are provided by the Contractor, the Department
 will assume the cost of processing samples to determine the suitability of the material.
 Sites from which material has been removed shall, upon completion of the work, be left in a neat
 and presentable condition.
 
 106.03 SAMPLES, TESTS, CITED SPECIFICATIONS. Materials will be inspected, tested and
 accepted by the Engineer before incorporation in the work. Work in which untested and unaccepted
 materials are used without approval of the Engineer shall be performed at the Contractor's risk. No
 payment will be made for materials found to be unacceptable and/or unauthorized. Unless otherwise
 designated, tests in accordance with the cited current standard methods of AASHTO, ASTM or other
 organizations used by the Department will be made by, and at the expense of the Department. Samples
 will be taken by a qualified representative of the Department. Materials being used are subject to
 inspection, test or rejection at any time prior to incorporation into the work. Copies of all tests will be
 furnished to the Contractor's representative upon request.
 Whenever there is an AASHTO designation followed by an ASTM designation, the AASHTO
 designation will govern when there are minor differences between the two specifications.
 
 106.04 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE. The Engineer may permit use, prior to sampling and
 testing, of certain materials or assemblies accompanied by Certificates of Compliance, stating that such
 materials or assemblies fully comply with the requirements of the Contract. The certificate shall be
 signed by the manufacturer. Each lot of such materials or assemblies delivered to the work must be
 accompanied by a Certificate of Compliance and clearly identified.
 Materials or assemblies used on the basis of Certificates of Compliance may be sampled and
 tested and if found not in conformity with Contract requirements will be subject to rejection whether in
 place or not.
 The form and distribution of Certificates of Compliance shall be as approved by the Engineer.
 The Engineer is authorized to refuse permission for use of materials or assemblies on the basis of
 Certificates of Compliance.
 Unexpired Warranties. If the Contractor is furnished a warranty at the time of purchase of any
 product or material and the warranty has not expired at the time of acceptance of the work by the State,
 the warranty shall then be turned over to the State.
 
 1−43
 
 106.05 PLANT INSPECTION. The Engineer may undertake the inspection of materials at the source.
 Manufacturing plants may be inspected for compliance with specified manufacturing methods. Material
 samples will be obtained for laboratory testing for compliance with materials quality requirements. This
 may be the basis for acceptance of manufactured lots as to quality.
 a. Conditions. In the event plant inspection is undertaken the following conditions shall apply:
 1. The Engineer shall have the cooperation and assistance of the Contractor and the producer
 with whom it has contracted for materials.
 2. The Engineer shall at all times have full access to those parts of the plant where the
 manufacture or production of materials is taking place.
 3. Adequate safety measures shall be provided and maintained.
 
 106.06 STORAGE OF MATERIALS. Materials shall be stored to insure the preservation of their
 quality and fitness for the work. Stored materials, even though approved before storage, may again be
 inspected prior to their use in the work. Stored materials shall be located to facilitate their prompt
 inspection.
 a. Location of Stored Materials and Equipment.
 1. Roads without Curbing and Sidewalks. Construction materials and equipment may be
 stored within the "clear zones" designated below provided that prior written approval has been granted by
 the Engineer. Material stored in these clear zones must be removed within fourteen (14) calendar days.
 Equipment may be stored in the clear zones only during workdays; i.e., no overnight storage of equipment
 will be allowed.

 Any area of the clear zones which is used for storage of construction material and/or equipment
 must be clearly delineated with appropriate traffic control devices.
 Storage sites shall be restored to their original condition at the sole expense of the Contractor.
 Additional space required for storage shall be provided at the Contractor's expense. Private
 property shall not be used for storage purposes without written permission of the owner or lessee. If
 requested by the Engineer, copies of such written permission shall be furnished by the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State and local statutes and/or ordinances in
 reference to the storage of materials, and shall be liable for all damages arising from the violation thereof.
 1−44
 
 2. Roads with Curbing and Sidewalks. No portion of the shoulders and sidewalks may be used
 for storage of construction equipment and/or material.
 
 106.07 HANDLING MATERIALS. Materials shall be handled in such manner to preserve their quality
 and fitness for the work. Aggregates shall be transported from the storage site to the work in vehicles
 constructed to prevent loss or segregation of materials after loading and measuring.
 
 106.08 UNACCEPTABLE MATERIALS. Materials not reasonably conforming to the requirements of
 the Specifications will be considered as unacceptable and all such materials will be rejected and removed
 immediately from the site of the work unless otherwise instructed by the Engineer. Rejected material, the
 defects of which have been corrected, shall not be used again until approval by the Engineer has been
 granted.
 
 106.09 DEPARTMENT-FURNISHED MATERIAL. The Contractor shall furnish materials required
 to complete the work, except those specified to be furnished by the Department.
 Material furnished by the Department will be delivered or made available to the Contractor at the
 points specified in the Contract Documents.
 The cost of handling and placing Department-furnished materials after they are delivered to the
 Contractor shall be included in the Contract price for the item in which they are used.
 The Contractor will be responsible for all material delivered. Deductions will be made from any
 monies due the Contractor for shortages, deficiencies, other causes, and damage which may occur after
 delivery. Demurrage charges, resulting from the Contractor's failure to accept the material at the
 designated time and point of delivery will also be deducted from monies due the Contractor.
 
 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PUBLIC
 
 107.01 LAWS TO BE OBSERVED. The Contractor shall keep fully informed of Federal and State
 laws, local laws, ordinances, and regulations and orders and decrees of bodies or tribunals having any
 jurisdiction or authority, which in any manner affect those engaged or employed on the Project, or which
 affect the conduct of the Project. The Contractor shall observe and comply with all such laws,
 ordinances, regulations, orders, and decrees; and shall protect and indemnify the State and its representatives against any claim or liability arising from the violation of any such law, ordinance, regulation, order,
 or decree, whether by the Contractor, the subcontractors, suppliers of materials or services, or others
 engaged by the Contractor, or the employees of any of them. If any discrepancy or inconsistency is
 discovered between the Contract and any law, ordinance, regulation, order or decree, the Contractor shall
 immediately report the same to the Engineer in writing.
 
 1−45
 
 The Contractor shall execute and file such documents, statements and affidavits required under
 applicable Federal or State law or regulation affecting its Proposal, Contract or the prosecution of the

 the public works being performed by him, within ninety (90) days after such obligation or
 charge is incurred or the trucking services has been performed or the material has been
 delivered to the site of the work, whichever is later. When it is brought to the notice of
 the proper authority in a city or town, or the proper authority in the state having
 supervision of such contract, that such obligation or charge has not been paid by the
 contractor or subcontractor, the proper authority may deduct and hold for a period not
 exceeding sixty (60) days, from sums of money due to the contractor or subcontractor,
 the equivalent amount of such sums certified by a trucker or materialman creditor as due
 him, as provided in this section, and which the proper authority determines is reasonable
 for trucking performed or materials furnished for such public works."
 "37-13-6. ASCERTAINMENT OF PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES. -- Before
 awarding any contract for public works to be done, the proper authority shall ascertain
 from the director of labor the general prevailing rate of the regular, holiday and overtime
 wages paid and the general prevailing payments on behalf of employees only, to lawful
 welfare, pension, vacation, apprentice training and educational funds (payments to said
 funds must constitute an ordinary business expense deduction for federal income tax
 purposes by contractors) in the city, town, village or other appropriate political
 subdivision of the state in which the work is to be performed, for each craft, mechanic,

 WAGES. -- every call for bids for:
 (a) every contract in excess of $1,000 to which the State of Rhode Island or
 any political subdivision thereof is party, for construction, alteration, and/or repair,
 including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public works of the State of
 Rhode Island or any political subdivision thereof, and which requires or involves the
 
 1−46
 
 employment of employees shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be
 paid various types of employees which shall be based upon the wages that will be
 determined by the director of labor to be prevailing for the corresponding types of
 employees employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the city,
 town, village, or other appropriate political subdivision of the State of Rhode Island in
 which the work is to be performed; and every contract shall contain a stipulation that the
 contractor or his subcontractor shall pay all said employees employed directly upon the
 site of the work, unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without
 subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at time of
 payment computed at wage rates not less than those stated in the call for bids, regardless
 of any contractual relationships which may be alleged to exist between the contractor or
 subcontractor and such employees and that the scale of wages to be paid shall be posted
 by the contractor in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work; and
 the further stipulation that there may be withheld from the contractor so much of accrued
 payments as may be considered necessary to pay to such employees employed by the
 contractor or any subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of wages
 required by the contract to be paid said employees on the work and the rates of wages
 received by such employees and not refunded to the contractor, subcontractors, or their
 agents;
 (b) the term `wages, scale of wages', `wage rates', `minimum wages', and
 `prevailing wages' shall include:
 (1) the basic hourly rate of pay; and

 compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity, or insurance to
 provide any of the foregoing, for unemployment benefits, life insurance, disability and
 sickness insurance, or accident insurance, for vacation and holiday pay, for defraying
 costs of apprenticeship or other similar programs, or for other bonafide fringe benefits,
 but only where the contractor or subcontractor is not required by other federal, state, or
 local law to provide any of such benefits: Provided, that the obligation of a contractor or
 subcontractor to make payment in accordance with the prevailing wage determinations
 of director of labor insofar as this chapter of this title and other acts incorporating this
 chapter of this title by reference are concerned may be discharged by the making of
 payments in cash, by the making of contributions of a type referred to in paragraph (2)
 (A), or by the assumption of an enforceable commitment to bear the costs of a plan or
 program of a type referred to a paragraph (2) (B), or any combination thereof, where the
 aggregate of any such payments, contributions, and costs is not less than the rate of pay
 described in paragraph (1) plus the amount referred to in paragraph (2)."

 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 108.01 SUBLETTING OF CONTRACT. The Contractor shall not sublet, sell, transfer, assign, or
 otherwise dispose of the Contract or contracts or any portion thereof, or of its right, title, or interest
 therein, without written consent of the Engineer. If such consent is given, the Contractor will only be
 permitted to sublet a portion thereof. The Contractor will be required to perform with its own
 organization, work amounting to not less than 40 percent of the adjusted contract cost. The adjusted
 contract cost is the total contract cost less the total cost of subcontract specialty items listed in the
 Proposal. Specialty Items are defined in Subsection 101.63.
 No subcontracts or transfers of Contract shall relieve the Contractor of liability under the Contract
 and Bonds. A copy of written agreements with subcontractors must be submitted when making
 application to sublet any work under the Contract. Furthermore, no agreements between the Contractor
 and its subcontractors or vendors shall create any "third party" relationships between said subcontractors
 or vendors and the State.
 The Contractor shall provide written notice to, and obtain prior written consent from the
 Engineer, before allowing any subcontractor to sublet any portion of its work to a lower-tier contractor.
 
 108.02 NOTICE TO PROCEED. The "Notice to Proceed" will stipulate the date the Contractor is
 expected to begin the construction and from which date contract time will be charged. Commencement of
 work by the Contractor constitutes a waiver of this notice.
 
 108.03 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS.

 The level of detail and Schedule Submission requirements will be based on the Schedule Level A, B, or
 C, which shall be defined in the Special Provisions of the Contract Documents.
 •
 
 Schedule Level A Projects with a high level of complexity, impact to the motoring public or
 community, and/or larger size Projects.
 
 •
 
 Schedule Level B Projects of average to moderate complexity, moderate impact to the
 motoring public or community, and/or average size.
 
 •
 
 Schedule Level C Smaller projects with minimal to no complexity, and minimal impact to
 the community. Typical examples would be resurfacing, maintenance, and landscaping
 projects.
 
 The CPM Schedule shall be the Contractor’s primary tool to organize and communicate their
 plan for the timely completion of the Project. The Schedule will be used to assess progress, delays,
 projection of time required, Contractor and RIDOT resources requirements, and any mitigation if
 necessary. The Schedule shall include all the work to be performed/required by the Primary Contractor,
 Subcontractors, equipment vendors, suppliers, Utility Companies, regulatory agencies, owner review and
 other work that is interrelated to the Contractor’s work. The CPM Schedule shall accurately portray the
 work planned and executed and shall reflect coordination of work.
 The following Schedule Submittals are required for all Projects:
 (A.)
 (B.)
 (C.)
 
 PRELIMINARY PROJECT SCHEDULE
 BASELINE PROJECT SCHEDULE
 STATUS SCHEDULE UPDATES
 
 Recovery Schedules will be required if requested by RIDOT.
 The Project Schedules shall be used by the Engineer and Contractor for the following purposes as
 well as those stated in these Specifications:
 •
 
 To identify the Critical Path and its specific activities.
 
 •
 
 To identify any changes in proposed work that differs from the Specifications or the Plans
 (i.e., alternate phasing, Value Engineering Proposals).
 
 •
 
 To document the actual progress of work and evaluate the time impact of changes in the
 work.

 2. Review and Acceptance of Project Schedule Submittals
 The Engineer shall review Schedule Submittals for conformance with the requirements of the
 Contract Documents. The planning, scheduling, and execution of the work and the accuracy of any
 Project Schedule shall remain the responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor is also responsible for
 errors in any previously accepted Project Schedule, including but not limited to activity durations,
 relationships between activities, resource allocation, or any float suppression techniques.
 Schedules that do not accurately reflect the work may be identified at any time. Once identified,
 they shall be addressed by the Contractor at no additional cost to the State. The acceptance of any Project
 Schedule by the Engineer does not constitute acceptance or approval of any change to the requirements of
 the Contract Documents including but not limited to any mandated construction sequences. Such
 acceptance shall not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility under the Contract for the successful
 completion of the work.
 c. Project Schedule Updates.
 Schedule Update Meetings shall be held every two weeks from Notice to Proceed to the
 completion of the Project. The Contractor shall be required to attend each meeting with all their update
 information (data as of the data date) compiled in advance. The Contractor shall have a complete and
 accurate report of the current progress and depiction of how future work plans shall meet the contract
 completion dates. Failure to attend meetings or submit Schedule Updates may result in Progress Payments
 being withheld. The Contractor shall provide a sufficient number of copies of the Updated Schedules at

 addressed and discussed with the Engineer at the Project Schedule Update Meeting. This shall be done
 prior to the Contractor submitting their final Schedule Updates.
 Changes to the accepted Baseline Schedule shall be detailed in the Schedule Update Narrative.
 The acceptance and inclusion of these changes shall not be the sole basis of acceptance or entitlement to
 any time extension(s) or cost(s).
 Schedule Update Submittals shall never be used as the sole basis for any adjustment in the
 Contract Time(s), regardless of any acceptance or approval by the Engineer. Any acceptance or approval
 of the Schedule Update Submittal by the Engineer, either expressed or implied, shall only apply to the
 issue of progress and not to any issue of acceptability or accuracy of the Schedule Update Submittal for
 use as a basis for measuring adjustments in Contract Time(s).
 d. Technical Schedule Requirements.
 For the purpose of enabling both the Engineer and the Contractor to readily evaluate CPM
 Schedules, including derived data and reports, the Schedules shall be developed and maintained in
 accordance with the following requirements. The Contractor will have access to templates of these
 requirements during Schedule Development.
 All CPM Schedules shall utilize a Work-Breakdown Structure (WBS) which shall be developed
 by the Contractor, during Schedule Development. The following is the basic dictionary for the WBS
 which may be appended, with Engineer’s acceptance, when further detail is required. Title Case shall be
 utilized in the development of the WBS descriptions. The WBS will be the primary code for displaying
 and organizing the graphical output schedules utilized for the project, unless otherwise directed by the
 Engineer.
 1. Basic Structure for WBS:
 XX.00 Contract Name
 XX.10 Milestones
 XX.15 Summary Activities
 XX.30 Procurement/Shop Drawings
 XX.40 Utility/RR & Work by Others
 XX.60 Construction
 
 XX are contract specific, alpha-numeric
 characters that will be defined by the Engineer.
 
 2. Project Naming Standards:
 Preliminary Project Schedule: PS00
 Baseline Schedule: BL00
 Bi-Weekly Status Schedules: Uxxx
 
 Recovery Schedule: Rxxx
 3. Project Milestones.
 
 1−61
 
 The Contractor shall include Milestones as specified in the Special Provisions of the Contract
 Documents. Late Finish Constraints shall be assigned to the Milestones where applicable.
 4. Activity ID.
 The Activity IDs shall be coded in accordance with the following convention:
 XX
 Project Specific
 (Alpha-numeric)
 
 ____
 WBS Code
 (Levels 2-5)
 
 ____
 Contractor Specific
 (Alpha-numeric)
 
 Example:
 XX
 Project Specific
 (Alpha-numeric)
 
 1000
 WBS Code
 (Levels 2-5)
 
 1000
 Contractor Specific
 (Alpha-numeric)
 
 Example:
 
 XX10001000
 
 The first two characters shall be contract specific, provided by the Engineer: "XX"
 Next characters: WBS codes levels 2 through 5 (two to six digits) assigned to the activity,
 without the decimal points.
 Last two characters: unique alpha numeric characters as designated by the Contractor.
 All 10 characters shall be used in the activity ID.
 5. Activity Codes.
 The CPM Schedules shall contain activity code classifications and code values. The Contractor
 shall propose a coding structure for the Engineer's review and acceptance. The activity code structure
 combined with the activity identification number shall provide the capability to organize information by
 location, road or ramp, structure, work type, Subcontractor, discipline, etc., as deemed necessary by the
 Engineer. The Contractor shall reserve three (3) code classifications (fields) and a minimum of six (6)
 characters for the Engineer's use.
 RESP code will be utilized for identification of responsible party. RESP values shall be
 discussed at the Schedule Development Meetings.
 6. Activity Descriptions.
 Each activity description shall have a narrative description consisting of verb or work function
 (i.e. form, pour, excavate, etc.,), object (i.e. slab, footing, wall, etc.), and location (i.e. STA, bridge, pier,
 or retaining wall number, street, ramp, etc.,). There shall be no two activities with the same activity
 description. For example, an acceptable description would be, “Pour Footing Ramp Rt –Sta. 42+00 to
 42+50”. The word(s) “Miscellaneous” or “Misc” or other non-specific terminology shall not be used in
 the activity’s description. Any abbreviations used in the activity descriptions shall be consistent with the
 abbreviations used throughout the Contract Documents, and should be listed therein. The formatting of
 the activity description in the software shall be left-justified and capitalized.
 7. Activity Durations.
 1−62
 
 The CPM Schedule shall have a minimal number of activities with durations less than two (2) (a
 short duration) and more than twelve (12) (a long duration) working days. The Contractor may request
 permission from the Engineer to assign durations greater than twelve (12) working days. If the Engineer
 accepts the Contractor’s request to use a long duration, the reason for the request shall be detailed in the
 Preliminary and Baseline Schedule Narratives.
 8. Activity Type.
 The following types of activities are required for use in the Schedule:
 (a) Milestone Activities – Only Milestones that are defined in the Contract’s Special Provisions
 shall utilize these activity types.
 (b) Summary (Hammock) Schedule Activities –The Contractor shall maintain a summary
 schedule of hammock activities. These schedule activities must remain in all of the Schedule Submittals.
 The Hammock’s predecessors and successors may be modified to include all those activities that are
 entered into the Schedule and considered part of the respective hammock activity’s scope of work.
 (c) Task Activities – This is the primary activity type. All activities other than Milestone and
 Summary as defined above shall be task activities.
 9. Activity Dates.
 Activity Early and Late Start and Finish dates shall be calculated for each activity based upon the
 schedule data date, actual dates, schedule logic, schedule constraints, calendars, and original duration or
 remaining duration in accordance with the scheduling parameters defined in this section. Actual dates
 shall be agreed upon by the Engineer.
 10. Cash Flow/Activity Bid Item Loading.
 The Contractor shall allocate the quantity for all bid items listed in the proposal pages. Each bid
 item will be associated with the corresponding schedule activity(ies). Each bid item shall be allocated to
 an activity or distributed to a group of activities. This shall be done through the use of Primavera’s
 resources dictionary and resource assignment. The summed value of that portion of the activities allocated
 to each bid item shall equal the total value of the corresponding bid item. The bid item loading will
 identify the quantity of the bid item(s) associated with each schedule activity. The result of this Bid Item
 Loading will be an accurate portrayal of the owner’s cash flow requirements for the project.
 11. Calendars.
 The following calendars shall be used in the Contractor’s Schedule. The Contractor may request
 permission from the Engineer to create additional calendars, however, use of these calendars is by
 Engineer’s acceptance. Additionally, the Contractor may not schedule work during the winter shutdown
 period unless the Contract specifically states that work will be performed at this time or it is later agreed
 to and documented. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to schedule their work during the time
 allotted in the Contract. The following calendars are:
 Calendar 1- 5-day workweek (includes Holidays and Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 2- Procurement
 Calendar 3- 6-day workweek (includes Holidays and Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 4- 7-day workweek (includes Holidays and Winter Shut Down)
 1−63
 
 Calendar 5- 5-day workweek (includes Holidays and No Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 6- 6-day workweek (includes Holidays and No Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 7- 7-day workweek (includes Holidays and No Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 8- Interstate 5-day workweek (includes Holidays & Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar 9- Interstate 6-day workweek (includes Holidays & Winter Shut Down)
 Calendar A - Seeding
 Calendar B - Wetland Seeding
 Calendar C- Plants B&B
 12. Data Date.
 The following are the definitions of the data dates for the CPM Schedules:
 Preliminary CPM Schedule –Date of Bid Opening
 Baseline CPM Schedule –Date of Bid Opening
 Status Update Schedules –TBD at Schedule Development Meeting
 13. Logic.
 The logic in the Schedules shall represent the progression of time and the sequence of work
 performed within the contract time. The CPM Schedules shall conform to the following requirements:
 Every activity shall have logically assigned predecessors and successors. Unless otherwise
 specified, the activity “Bid Opening” shall be the only activity without a predecessor, “Contract
 Completion” and each Contract Milestone shall be the only activities without successors.
 The use of activity constraints is limited to the use of Start-No-Earlier-Than and Finish-No-LaterThan, for access restraints and Completion Milestone(s). The Contractor may request permission from
 the Engineer to use these constraints for other activities but acceptance is required for incorporation in the
 CPM Schedule. The use of Zero Free Float, Start On, Expected Finish, Mandatory Start or Mandatory
 Finish is strictly prohibited.
 Activity lag durations shall not have a negative value unless the Contractor can convince the
 Engineer that it best represents realistic conditions. Activity lags shall not be used in lieu of logic
 relationships.
 Redundant ties to preceding activities in a sequential series of activities will not be permitted.
 For example:
 •
 •
 •
 
 Activity C is a successor in a Finish-Start relationship to B
 Activity B is a successor in a Finish-Start relationship to A
 Activity shall not have redundant Finish-Start relations to C
 
 A tie representing a different constraint will not be considered redundant. For example, a logic
 tie showing the completion of the work scope of a predecessor is required before the successor can start is
 different from a logic tie representing a resource limitation and will not be considered redundant.
 The Critical Path for a project shall be defined as the longest continuous series of activities
 progressing toward a Contractual Milestone or Contract Completion.
 
 1−64
 
 Out-of-sequence logic shall not be permitted to be included in a submitted CPM Schedule. The
 Contractor is responsible for identifying, correcting, and updating any out-of-sequence logic in a
 Schedule.
 Float is not for the exclusive use or benefit of either the Engineer or the Contractor. It is an
 expiring resource available to all parties, acting in good faith, as needed to meet any Contract
 Milestone(s).
 14. Schedule Layout Requirements.
 The Engineer will provide the Contractor with the required layouts for the Schedule.
 15. Schedule Calculations.
 Performing scheduling calculations requires the following settings:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 Turn off automatic scheduling and leveling.
 When scheduling activities, apply retained logic.
 Calculate the start-to-start lag from early start.
 Schedule durations as: contiguous.
 Show open ends as: non-critical.
 Calculate total float as: finish float.
 Summary calculations shall use Calendar No. 1 and the weighting factor
 for determining percent complete shall be duration.
 Set the auto-inserting option on automatic with a minimum increment of three (3).
 Initially set critical activities using defined critical as: total float less than one (1). This option
 may be changed at the direction of the Engineer.
 Set language for output as: U.S. English.
 
 16. Submittals and Procurement.
 All Submittals and Shop Drawings will be represented in the Contractor’s Submittal List (CSL)
 and shall be cross referenced in the Project Schedule utilizing the Item Codes from the Specifications. At
 a minimum, each submittal in the CSL will have a corresponding submittal preparation activity in the
 Schedule. Each submittal activity will have corresponding review and approval activity. Each submittal
 item will also have a corresponding procurement activity identifying the duration for the procurement of
 the corresponding materials, equipment, etc. The accuracy and completeness will be the responsibility of
 the Contractor. The Contractor is responsible for any delays due to inaccuracies in identifying Shop
 Drawings, Submittals, and Procurement Requirements.
 e. Schedule Submission Narratives.

 f. Progress Delays.
 The Contractor shall identify and promptly report to the Engineer all schedule and progress
 delays during the prosecution of the work. The Contractor shall promptly take appropriate action to
 develop a Recovery Schedule in the form of a revised Baseline Schedule whenever the actual physical
 progress is behind schedule, as compared to the Current Baseline Schedule, or whenever requested by the
 Engineer.
 At a minimum, the Contractor shall submit a Recovery Schedule whenever the Project Schedule
 Update becomes thirty (30) or more Days late to any Milestone(s) designated in section 108.03,
 Milestones. The Proposed Baseline Schedule Revision shall be in accordance with corresponding section
 contained herein. The development and submission of a Recovery Schedule does not relieve the
 Contractor from continuing with the submission of the Project Status Schedule Submittals.
 The submission of the Recovery Schedule shall be at no cost to the Engineer and shall be
 submitted within (30) days of the Project Schedule Update. The Recovery Schedule shall demonstrate a
 clear procedure for bringing the Project into compliance with a time line acceptable to the Engineer.
 The Department may request a Recovery Schedule due to a delay that is not the fault of the
 Contractor. Cost associated with the development of these Schedules will be considered a reimbursable
 expense. Normal adverse weather shall be anticipated by, and planned for by the Contractor. Delays due
 to such weather events are unacceptable. Failure to submit such a Recovery Plan shall provide a basis for
 future Payment Application withholdings, either in whole, or in part, by the Engineer.
 1. Baseline Schedule Revisions.
 In the event of a significant delay, or changes to the Project’s Schedule as determined by the
 Engineer, or any situation where time needs to be recovered, a Revised Baseline Schedule may be
 required.
 Baseline Schedule Revision Submittals shall include a comprehensive listing of all activities
 added to or deleted from the Current Baseline Schedule of Record as well as a complete listing of all logic
 and activity relationship changes which have been made. All changes in the schedule must be fully
 described in an accompanying narrative. No Baseline Schedule Revision Submittal will be accepted
 unless it satisfies the following requirements:
 •
 
 Any out-of-sequenced logic is corrected or explained to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 
 •
 
 Start and Finish dates are verified for accuracy.
 
 •
 
 The Schedule accurately reflects the Contractor's plan (including accurate logic and
 durations) for completing the remaining work.
 
 All changes from the accepted Baseline Schedule to the proposed Revised Baseline Schedule
 must be identified and accepted by the Engineer prior to incorporation into the Revised Schedule. Any
 1−68
 
 proposed changes and/or revisions to the Current Baseline Schedule accepted by the Engineer pursuant to
 its review of a Proposal Schedule (definition required) submitted by the Contractor shall be incorporated
 into the Current Baseline Schedule and submitted as a Baseline Schedule Revision Submittal. A Baseline
 Schedule Revision Submittal shall be due within 5 days following the Engineer's acceptance of the
 proposed schedule changes and/or revisions, as submitted in a Proposal Schedule, and shall consist of the
 requirements of the Baseline Schedule, as supplemented below. The Baseline Schedule Revision shall
 include a cost distribution for added work and/or costs for review and acceptance by the Engineer.
 Once a Baseline Schedule Revision Submittal is accepted by the Engineer it shall become the
 Current Baseline Schedule Revision of Record (and be used for subsequent Schedule Update Submittals),
 and shall be referred to by its revision number.
 Except as otherwise designated by Change Order, no Current Baseline Schedule Revision that
 extends performance beyond any Contract Time and/or Contract Milestone(s) shall qualify as a Current
 Baseline Schedule Revision of Record that would allow it to be used to demonstrate entitlement to a Time
 Extension. In no case shall a Schedule Update be construed as a Baseline Schedule Revision of Record
 unless it is specifically submitted and accepted as such by the Engineer.
 
 108.04 LIMITATION OF OPERATIONS. The Contractor shall conduct the work to assure the least
 interference with traffic. The Contractor shall have due regard to the location of detours and to the
 provisions for handling traffic. The Contractor shall not open up work to the prejudice or detriment of
 work already started or completed. The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on which
 work is in progress before work is started on any additional sections if the opening of such section is
 essential to public convenience. Any extra costs will be considered under Subsection 104.04;
 Alterations in the Plans or Details.
 
 108.05 CHARACTER OF WORKERS. The Contractor shall employ sufficient labor, supervision, and
 equipment for prosecuting the several classes of work to full completion in the manner and time required
 by the Contract.
 All workers shall have sufficient skill and experience to perform properly the work assigned to
 them. Workers engaged in special work or skilled work shall have sufficient experience in such work and
 in the operation of the equipment required to satisfactorily perform such work.
 Any person employed by the Contractor or by any subcontractor who does not perform the work
 in a proper and skillful manner or is intemperate or disorderly shall, at the written request of the Engineer,
 be removed forthwith by the Contractor or subcontractor employing such person, and shall not be
 employed again in any portion of the work without the approval of the Engineer.
 Should the Contractor fail to remove such person or persons as required above, or fail to furnish
 suitable and sufficient personnel for the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may withhold
 progress payments from the Contractor which are or may become due, and suspend the work by written
 notice until such orders are complied with.
 
 108.06 METHODS AND EQUIPMENT. All equipment which is proposed to be used on the work
 shall be of sufficient size and in such mechanical condition as to meet requirements of the work and to
 1−69
 
 produce a satisfactory quality of work. Equipment used on any portion of the project shall not cause
 injury to the roadway, adjacent property, or other highways.
 When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor are not prescribed in the Contract,
 the Contractor shall use any methods or equipment that will accomplish the contract work in conformity
 with the requirements of the Contract.
 When the Contract specifies the use of certain methods and equipment, these methods and
 equipment shall be used unless others are approved by the Engineer. If the Contractor desires to use a
 method or type of equipment other than those specified in the Contract, it may request approval from the
 Engineer for such use. The request shall be in writing and shall include full description of the methods
 and equipment proposed for use and the reasons for making the change. If approval is granted, it will be
 on the condition that the Contractor will be responsible for producing construction work in conformity
 with Contract requirements. If, after trial use of the substituted methods or equipment, the Engineer
 determines that the work produced does not meet Contract requirements, the Contractor shall discontinue
 the use of the substitute method or equipment and shall complete the remaining work with the specified
 methods and equipment. The Contractor shall remove the deficient work and replace it with work of
 specified quality, or take such other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No change will be
 made in the basis of payment for the construction items involved nor in contract time as a result of
 approving a change in methods or equipment.
 
 108.07 DETERMINATION AND EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME.
 a. Completion Time. The number of days allowed for the completion of work, or date by which
 the work shall be completed, will be stated in the Proposal and Contract Agreement, and will be known as
 the "Contract Time.”
 The time for completion stated in the Contract, is expressed as a fixed calendar date, and is based
 on the original quantities as defined in Subsection 102.03; Interpretation of Quantities in Bid
 Schedule. If satisfactory completion of the Contract requires work to be performed in greater quantities
 than those set forth in the Contract Documents, and the Contractor shall show to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer that the additional work effects his schedule and contract completion date(s), the time allowed
 for completion shall be increased on a basis corresponding with the new contract schedule.
 The time for completion stated in the Contract has been developed on the assumption that work
 will be suspended during winter shutdown, i.e., the period from December 15th through the following
 April 15th unless otherwise specified in the contract documents.
 b. Delays. If the Contractor finds it beyond their control to complete the work within the contract
 time as specified, or as extended in accordance with the provisions of this Subsection, the Contractor
 may, at any time prior to the expiration of the contract time, make a written request to the Engineer. The
 Contractor's claim that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for notifying the Resident Engineer within thirty (30)
 calendar days of any Department action or omission which the Contractor believes has delayed or may
 delay the project. Notification and documentation of the delays shall be in accordance with Section
 105.20 Project Delays. Such notification shall be a precondition to consideration of an extension of time.
 
 1−70
 
 If the Engineer determines that the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control
 and without the fault of the Contractor, the time for completion may be extended for such period as
 conditions justify.
 c. Requirements for Time Extension Request. The Contractor’s request shall be submitted as a
 comprehensive Time Extension Request Package. It shall include a narrative, project schedules, copies of
 all supporting documentation, and related correspondence. The submissions shall be considered a single
 package and all information shall mutually substantiate the requested extension of time.
 1.
 
 At a minimum the narrative shall include the following:
 
 (a)
 
 Detailed project history including overall project performance by the Contractor,
 subcontractors, the Department, and third parties that affected the necessity for the time
 extension request.
 
 (b)
 
 Identification, description, and documentation for each delay issue. This shall include the
 circumstances which occurred resulting in the delay, the responsible parties for the delay
 and when the Contractor notified the Department regarding the delay. The number of
 calendar days each delay impacted each milestone shall be calculated and reported.
 
 (c)
 
 Identification, description, and documentation for each mitigation action. This shall
 include the actions taken by each party to mitigate delays, the dates of such actions, and
 the resulted calendar days which were gained or mitigated by such actions.
 
 2.
 At a minimum, project schedules shall be included in the Time Extension Package to
 substantiate the delays and mitigation actions to the project. Engineer Accepted Schedules shall be
 referenced as is; schedules either Accepted as Noted, Not Accepted, or Rejected shall be corrected before
 for use in the delay analysis. The number of days requested shall be substantiated by the project
 schedules.
 3.
 At a minimum the project documentation and correspondence shall be included in the
 submitted Time Extension Package. This documentation shall include letters, memos, directives, field
 notes, emails, etc which substantiates any delays or mitigation detailed in the narrative.
 
 108.08 FAILURE TO COMPLETE ON TIME.
 a. Phased Completion, Interim Completion and Substantial Completion. For each day,
 including work days, Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays, that any unit or portion of the work shall remain
 uncompleted as defined by Subsection 105.17; Acceptance, Para. a., Partial Acceptance, the applicable
 Daily Charge will be deducted from any money due the Contractor, not as a penalty but as liquidated
 damages. The Job Specific Phased and Interim Completion Dates and Associated Liquidated Damages
 are defined in Special Provision Code 108.1000; Prosecution and Progress.
 An adjustment of the contract time for completion of the work granted under the provisions of
 Subsection 108.07 hereto will be considered in the assessment of liquidated damages.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work, or any part of it, after the contract time,
 or any extensions thereof, has passed will not waive the Department’s rights under the Contract. Unless
 otherwise specified, liquidated damages will not be assessed during the winter shutdown period, i.e.,
 December 15th through the following April 15th.
 1−71
 
 b. Final Completion. For each day, including work days, Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays, that
 any work shall remain uncompleted after the time established for completion of the work in Subsection
 105.17; Acceptance, Para. b, Final Acceptance, the applicable Daily Charge specified below, will be
 deducted from any money due the Contractor, not as a penalty, but as liquidated damages. An adjustment
 of the contract time for completion of the work granted under the provisions of Subsection 108.07 hereto
 will be considered in the assessment of liquidated damages.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work, or any part of it, after the contract time
 or any extensions thereof, has passed will not waive the Department’s rights under the Contract. Unless
 otherwise specified, liquidated damages will not be assessed during the winter shutdown period, i.e.,
 December 15th through the following April 15th.
 Rates for liquidated damages will be established in accordance with the Schedule. When the
 contract time is either the calendar day or fixed calendar day basis, the schedule for calendar days shall be
 used. When the contract time is on a work day basis, the schedule for work days will be used.

 notice in writing to the Contractor and the Surety of such default, advising the Contractor of actions
 required to remedy said default.
 If the Contractor or Surety, within a period of 10 days of receipt of such notice, does not proceed
 in accordance therewith, then the Department will have full power and authority, without violating the
 Contract, to assume prosecution of the work from the Contractor. The Department may appropriate or
 use the Contractor's materials and equipment at the site as may be suitable for use in the project and may
 enter into an agreement with another contractor for the completion of said Contract according to the terms
 and provisions thereof, or use such other methods as in the opinion of the Engineer will be required for
 the completion of Contract.
 All costs and charges incurred by the Department as a result of the default, including the cost of
 completing the work under Contract and any applicable liquidated damages, will be deducted from any
 monies due or to become due the Contractor. If such costs exceed the sum which would have been
 payable under the Contract, then the Contractor and the Surety shall be liable and shall pay to the
 Department the balance of such costs in excess of the contract amount.
 If it is determined, after termination of the Contractor's right to proceed, that the Contractor was
 not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the termination had been
 issued for the convenience of the Department in accordance with Subsection 108.10. Thus, damages to
 1−73
 
 which a Contractor may be entitled as a result of the improper default termination will be limited to
 appropriate amounts for the items listed in Subsection 108.10; Termination of Contract.
 
 108.10 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT.
 a. Reasons for Termination. The Department may terminate the entire Contract, or any portion
 thereof, when the Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the prescribed work for any of the
 following reasons:
 1. An Executive Order of the President of the United States with respect to the prosecution of
 war; in the interest of national defense; or any civil emergency or natural disaster.
 2. An Executive Order of the Governor of the State with respect to a natural disaster or civil
 emergency.
 3. Court orders relating to energy consumption, and orders or injunctions obtained by third party
 action resulting from national or local environmental protection laws.
 4. Discovery of unanticipated archaeological artifacts of a significant nature that would require
 extensive and time-consuming delays in the work for the purposes of identification, evaluation, and
 possibly recovery.
 5. Occurrence of an unanticipated environmental situation of a significant nature that would
 require extensive and time-consuming delays in the work for the purposes of identification, evaluation,
 and possibly mitigation.
 6. Any other circumstances beyond the control of either the Department or the Contractor that
 precludes the orderly prosecution or completion of the work and that is in the public interest.
 The Engineer shall terminate the Contract by delivering to the Contractor a Notice of Termination
 which shall specify the extent of the termination, the reasons therefore, and the effective date thereof.
 b. Termination Procedures. After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by
 the Engineer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed with the following obligations:
 1. Stop work as specified in the notice.
 2. Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as subcontracts in this clause for materials,
 services, or facilities, except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the Contract.
 3. Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work terminated.
 4. With approval or ratification to the extent required by the Engineer, settle all outstanding
 liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the approval
 or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
 
 1−74
 
 5. As directed by the Engineer, transfer title and deliver to the Department the fabricated,
 partially fabricated, or unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other material
 produced or acquired for the work terminated; and the completed or partially competed plans, drawings,
 information, and other property that, if the Contract had been completed, would be required to be
 furnished to the Department.
 6. Complete performance of the work not terminated.
 7. Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Engineer may direct, for the protection and
 preservation of the property related to this Contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and in
 which the Department has or may acquire an interest.
 8. At the direction of the Engineer, acceptable materials obtained by the Contractor for the
 Project but which have not been incorporated therein, may be purchased from the Contractor at actual
 cost delivered to a prescribed location, or disposed of as mutually agreed.
 When the Department orders termination of a Contract, or portion thereof, effective on a certain
 date, all completed items of work as of that date will be paid for at the contract bid prices. Payment for
 partially completed work will be made either at agreed prices or in accordance with the subparagraph
 below entitled, "Contractor and Department Fail to Agree.” Items that are eliminated in their entirety by
 such termination shall be paid for as provided in Subsection 109.05; Eliminated Items.
 The Contractor shall submit, within 60 days of the effective termination date, a claim for
 additional damages or costs not covered above or elsewhere in the Contract. Such claim may include
 such cost items as reasonable idle equipment time, mobilization efforts, bidding and project investigative
 costs, overhead expenses attributable to the project terminated, legal and accounting charges involved in
 claim preparation, subcontractor costs not otherwise paid for, actual idle labor cost if work is stopped in
 advance of termination date, guaranteed payments for private land usage as part of the original Contract,
 and any other cost or damage for which the Contractor feels reimbursement should be made. The intent
 of negotiating this claim would be that an equitable settlement be reached with the Contractor. In no
 event will loss of anticipated profits be considered as part of any settlement.
 The Contractor and the Department may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be
 paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work
 performed. The Contract shall be amended, and the Contractor paid the agreed amount.
 c. Contractor and Department Fail to Agree. If the Contractor and the Department fail to
 agree on the whole amount to be paid the Contractor because of the termination of work, the Department
 shall pay the Contractor the amounts determined as follows, but without duplication of any amounts
 agreed upon above;
 1. For contract work performed before the effective date of termination, the total of the
 following:
 (a) The cost of this work;
 (b) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated
 subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the termination portion of the Contract; and
 1−75
 
 (c) A sum, as profit on (a), above, determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable;
 however, if the Contractor would have sustained a loss on the entire Contract had it been completed, the
 Department shall allow no profit and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate loss.
 2. The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including:
 (a) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of
 termination settlement proposals and support data;
 (b) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements);
 and
 (c) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably necessary for the preservation,
 protection, or disposition of the termination inventory.
 3. Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the Department expressly assumed
 the risk of loss, the Department shall exclude from the amounts payable to the Contractor, the fair value,
 as determined by the Department of property that is destroyed, lost, stolen, or damaged so as to become
 undeliverable to the Department or to the buyer.
 4. In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted:
 (a) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor under the terminated portion of
 this Contract;
 (b) Any claim which the Department has against the Contractor under this Contract; and
 (c) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of materials, supplies, or other things acquired
 by the Contractor or sold under the provisions of this clause and not recovered by or credited to the
 Department.
 d. Partial Termination. If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file a proposal with the
 Department for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the Contract. The
 Department shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Contractor for an
 equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of
 termination unless extended in writing by the Engineer.
 e. Records. The Department may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial
 payments and payments against costs incurred by the Contractor for the terminated portion of the
 Contract, if the Department believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the
 Contractor will be entitled.
 The Contractor shall maintain and make available all project cost records to the Department for
 audit to the extent necessary to determine the validity and amount of each item claimed. This includes all
 books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's costs and expenses under this Contract. The
 Contractor shall make these records and documents available to the Department, at the Contractor's
 office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Department, photographs,
 1−76
 
 microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and
 documents.
 f. Contractual Responsibilities. Termination of a Contract or portion thereof shall not relieve
 the Contractor of contractual responsibilities for the work completed, nor shall it relieve the Surety of its
 obligation for and concerning any just claim arising out of the work performed.
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 109.01 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES. Work completed under the Contract will be measured
 by the Engineer according to United States standard measure, or by the metric system when the Contract
 so provides.
 A station when used as a definition or term of measurement will denote 100 linear feet.
 The method of measurement and computations to be used to determine quantities of materials
 furnished and work performed under the Contract will be those methods generally recognized as
 conforming to good engineering practice.
 Unless otherwise specified, longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made
 horizontally, and no deductions will be made for individual fixtures in the roadway having an area of 9
 square feet or less. Unless otherwise specified, transverse measurements for area computations will be
 the neat dimensions shown on the Plans.
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the Plans or as altered to fit field
 conditions.
 Items which are measured by the linear foot, such as pipe culverts, curb, guardrail, underdrains,
 etc., will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which such structures are placed, unless
 otherwise shown on the Plans.
 In computing volumes of excavation the average end area method, or other acceptable methods,
 will be used.
 The thickness of plates and galvanized sheet used in the manufacture of corrugated metal pile,
 metal plate pipe culverts and arches, and metal cribbing will be specified and measured in decimal
 fractions of inches.
 The term "gauge" shall mean the standard gauges as established by AASHTO, ASTM, U.S.A.S.I.
 or Manufacturer's standards, in the order of precedence listed.
 The term "ton" will mean the short ton consisting of 2,000 pounds avoirdupois. Materials which
 are measured or proportioned by weight shall be weighed on accurate, approved scales by competent,
 qualified personnel at locations designated by the Engineer. If material is shipped by rail, the car weight
 1−77
 
 may be accepted provided that payment is made only for the actual weight of such material. However,
 car weights will not be acceptable for material that is passed through mixing plants. Trucks used to haul
 material being paid for by weight shall be weighed empty daily at such times as the Engineer directs.
 Each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
 Materials to be measured by volume in the hauling vehicle shall be hauled in approved vehicles
 and measured in such vehicles at the point of delivery. Vehicles for this purpose may be of any size or
 type acceptable to the Engineer, provided that the body is of such shape that the actual volume may be
 readily and accurately determined. Vehicles shall be loaded to at least their water level capacity and all
 loads shall be leveled when the vehicles arrive at the point of delivery. However, any "heap" above the
 water level line may be computed for quantity if authorized by the Engineer.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved in writing by the Engineer, material specified to
 be measured by the cubic yard may be weighed and such weights will be converted to cubic yards for
 payment purposes. Factors for conversion from weight measurement to volume measurement will be
 determined by the Engineer and shall be acceptable to the Contractor before such method of measurement
 of quantities is employed.
 Bituminous materials will be measured as indicated in the Proposal. Volumes will be measured
 at 60 F or will be corrected to the volume at 60OF using ASTM D1250 for asphalts or ASTM D633 for
 tars.
 O
 
 Net certified scale weights, or weights converted from certified volumes in the case of rail
 shipments, will be used as a basis of measurement. Such weights, however, shall be subject to correction
 whenever bituminous material has been lost from the car or the distributor, wasted, or otherwise not
 incorporated in the work.
 When bituminous materials are shipped by truck or transport, net certified weights or volume
 subject to correction for loss or foaming, may be used for computing quantities.
 Cement will be measured by the pound.
 Timber will be measured by thousand foot-board measure (M.F.B.M.) actually incorporated in
 the structure. Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of
 each piece.
 The term "lump sum" when used in the Bid Schedule as an item of payment will mean complete
 payment for the work so described in the Contract.
 When a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, "lump sum" work) is specified as the unit
 of measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 Rental of equipment will be measured by time in hours of actual working time and necessary
 travel time within the limits of the project. If special equipment has been ordered by the Engineer in
 connection with force account work, travel time and transportation to the project will be measured. If
 equipment has been ordered held on the job on a standby basis by the Engineer, half-time rates for the
 equipment will be paid.
 1−78
 
 When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe
 conduit, etc., and these items are identified by gauge, unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such
 identification will be considered to be nominal weights or dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled
 by tolerances in cited specifications, manufacturing tolerances established by the respective industries
 will be accepted.
 Scales for the weighing of highway and bridge construction materials that are required to be
 proportioned or measured and paid for by weight, shall be furnished, erected, and maintained by the
 Contractor, or be certified permanently installed commercial scales.
 Scales shall be accurate within ½ of 1 percent of the correct weight throughout the range of use.
 The Contractor shall have the scales checked under the observation of the Inspector before beginning
 work and at such other times as requested. The intervals shall be uniform in spacing throughout the
 graduated or marked length of the beam or dial and shall not exceed 1/10 of 1 percent of the nominal
 rated capacity of the scale; but not less than 1 pound. The use of spring balances will not be permitted.
 Beams, dials, platforms, and other scale equipment shall be arranged so that the operator and
 inspector can safely and conveniently view them.
 Scale installations shall have available ten standard 50 pound weights for testing the weighing equipment
 or suitable weights and devices for other approved equipment.
 Scales must be tested for accuracy and serviced before use at a new site. Platform scales shall be
 installed and maintained with the platform level and rigid bulkheads at each end.
 Scales over weighing (indicating more than true weight) will not be permitted to operate and
 materials received subsequent to the last correct weighing accuracy test will be reduced by the percentage
 of error in excess of ½ of 1 percent.
 In the event inspection reveals the scales have been under weighing, they shall be adjusted and no
 additional payment to the Contractor will be allowed for materials previously weighed and recorded.
 Costs in connection with furnishing, installing, certifying, testing, and maintaining scales; for
 furnishing check weights and scale house, and for all other items specified in this Subsection for weighing
 of highway and bridge construction materials for proportioning or payment shall be included in the unit
 contract prices for the various pay items of the project.
 When the estimated quantities for a specific portion of the work are designated as pay quantities
 in the Contract, they shall be the final quantities for which payment will be made, unless the dimensions
 of the work shown on the Plans are revised by the Engineer. If revised dimensions result in an increase or
 decrease in the quantities of work, the final quantities for payment will be revised in the amount
 represented by the authorized changes.
 
 109.02 SCOPE OF PAYMENT. The Contractor shall receive and accept compensation provided for in
 the Contract as full payment for furnishing all materials and for performing all work under the Contract in
 a complete and acceptable manner, and for all risk, loss, damage, or expense of whatever character arising
 out of the nature or prosecution of the work, subject to the provisions of Subsections 104.03; Differing
 Site Conditions and 107.16; No Waiver of Legal Rights.
 1−79
 
 If the "Basis of Payment" clause in the specifications relating to any unit price in the Bid
 Schedule requires that the said unit price cover and be considered compensation for certain work or
 material essential to the item, this same work or material will not also be measured or paid for under any
 other pay item which may appear elsewhere in the Contract.
 
 109.03 COMPENSATION FOR ALTERED QUANTITIES. When the accepted quantities of work
 vary from the quantities in the Bid Schedule, the Contractor shall accept payment at the original contract
 unit prices for the accepted quantities of work performed. No allowance will be made for any reason
 except as provided for in Subsections 104.03; 104.05; and 104.07; Differing Site Conditions, Extra
 Work, and Significant Changes in the Character of the Work, respectively.
 
 109.04 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS, CHANGES, EXTRA WORK AND FORCE ACCOUNT
 WORK.
 a. Methods of Payment. Differing site conditions, changes, extra work, and significant changes
 in the character of the work, all performed in accordance with SECTION 104; SCOPE OF WORK, will
 be paid for in accordance with the following methods as appropriate:
 1. Contract unit prices.
 2. Unit prices agreed upon in the order authorizing the work.
 3. An agreed upon lump sum amount.
 4. If directed by the Department, on a Force Account Basis to be compensated in the following
 manner:
 (a) Labor. For all labor and foremen in direct charge of the specific operations, the Contractor
 shall receive the rate of wage actually paid as shown by its certified payroll, which rate shall be at least
 the prevailing rate of wage (or scale), for each and every hour that said labor and foremen are actually
 engaged in the work.
 No part of the salary or expenses of anyone connected with the Contractor's forces above the
 grade of foreman, and having general supervision of the work, will be included in the labor item as
 specified above.
 The Engineer reserves the right to determine the number and type of labor employed.
 The Contractor shall receive the actual costs paid to, or in behalf of, workers by reason of
 subsistence and travel allowances, health and welfare benefits, pension fund benefits or other benefits,
 when such amounts are required by collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract
 generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the work.
 An amount equal to 20 percent of the sum of the above items will also be paid the Contractor.
 1−80
 
 (b) Bond, Insurance and Tax. For property damage, liability, worker's compensation insurance
 premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, and social security taxes incurred on force account
 work, the Contractor shall receive the actual cost, to which cost a surcharge of 6-percent will be added.
 The Contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for such bonds, insurances and
 taxes.
 (c) Materials. For materials accepted by the Engineer and used in the work, the Contractor shall
 receive the actual cost of such materials delivered to the site, including transportation charges paid
 (exclusive of machinery rentals as hereinafter set forth), to which cost a surcharge of 15 percent will be
 added. The Contractor will not be reimbursed for any penalty or carrying charge incurred due to late or
 delayed payment for materials used in the work.
 (d) Equipment. For any machinery or special equipment (other than small tools) including
 transportation cost, the use of which has been authorized by the Engineer, the Contractor shall receive
 either the "hourly rental rates" as prescribed herein by the Department, or the actual documented cost plus
 an amount equal to 10 percent of said actual documented cost, whichever is less. Under no circumstance
 shall the payment exceed the replacement cost of the equipment.
 All rental rates shall include the estimated operating cost as indicated for that equipment in either
 the Rental Rate Blue Book or the Rental Rate Blue Book for Older Equipment, including the Rate
 Adjustment Tables approved for projects wholly or partially funded by the Federal Highway
 Administration (FHWA). Operators' wages are not included in the estimated operating cost and are paid
 separately, except for certain specified equipment in which the operator's wages are included.
 The "hourly rental rate" for an individual piece of equipment shall be determined by dividing the
 associated monthly rate, modified by the Rate Adjustment Tables, as contained in the Rental Rate Blue
 Book by one hundred seventy-six (176). There will be no adjustment to the hourly rate for the period of
 use.
 For rented equipment, the cost shall be based on the actual documented cost plus an amount equal
 to 10-percent of said actual documented cost, subject to the conditions set forth below. The actual
 documented cost shall consist of the paid invoice for rented equipment plus other documented operating
 costs (i.e. fuel, maintenance, repairs, etc.).
 Actual documented costs plus 10 percent of said costs shall not exceed the cost as calculated from
 the RENTAL RATE BLUE BOOK or the RENTAL RATE BLUE BOOK FOR OLDER
 CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. The Contractor shall submit documentation for both the hourly rental
 rates and actual documented costs to determine that the actual documented costs plus 10 percent of said
 costs does not exceed the calculated rental rate costs. No percentage surcharges will be added to the
 "Blue Book" rates as prescribed herein for rented equipment.
 For equipment which is already on the project, the rental period shall start when such equipment
 is ordered to work by the Engineer, and shall continue until ordered to stop work.
 For equipment which has to be brought to the project specifically for use on force account work,
 the State will pay all loading and unloading costs, and all transportation costs to and from the project,
 including assembling and dismantling, provided, however, that the cost of return transportation shall not
 exceed that of moving the equipment to the project. Loading, unloading and transportation costs will not
 1−81
 
 be paid if the equipment is used for work other than force account work while on the project. The rental
 period shall start at the time the equipment is ready for operation, and shall extend during the period of
 time the equipment is actually utilized on force account work. The rental period shall end when the
 equipment is released by the Engineer.
 All equipment, including trucks, shall, in the judgment of the Engineer, be in good working
 condition and suitable for the purpose intended. The Engineer reserves the right to determine the number
 of units of the various types of equipment to be employed on force account work. The manufacturer's
 model identification shall be the basis for identifying the type of equipment for payment purposes.
 Certification for the model year of the equipment will be required.
 (e) Miscellaneous. No additional allowance will be made for general superintendence, the use
 of small tools, or other costs for which no specific allowance is herein provided.
 (f) Compensation. The Contractor's representative and the Engineer shall daily compare records
 of work completed on a force account basis. The Engineer will then prepare the daily work sheets and
 said sheets will be signed by the Contractor's representative no later than noon of the next working day.
 (g) Statements. No payment will be made for work performed on a force account basis until the
 Contractor has furnished the Engineer with six copies of itemized statements of the cost of such work,
 incurred on a daily basis, and detailed as follows:
 (1) Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate and extension for each laborer and
 foreman.
 (2) Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate, and extension for each unit of
 machinery and equipment.
 (3) Quantities of materials, prices, and extensions.
 (4) Transportation of materials.
 (5) Cost of property damage, liability and worker's compensation insurance premiums,
 unemployment insurance contributions, and social security taxes.
 Statements shall be accompanied and supported by certified payrolls, and receipted invoices for
 all materials used and transportation charges. However, if materials used on the force account work are
 not specifically purchased for such work but are taken from the Contractor's stock, then in lieu of the
 invoices, the Contractor shall furnish an affidavit certifying that such materials were taken from its stock,
 that the quantity claimed was actually used, and that the price and transportation claimed represent the
 actual cost to the Contractor.
 
 109.05 ELIMINATED ITEMS. Should any items contained in the Contract be found unnecessary for
 the proper completion of the work, the Engineer may, upon written order to the Contractor, eliminate the
 items from the Contract, and the action shall not invalidate the Contract. When a Contractor is notified of
 the elimination of items, the Contractor will be reimbursed for actual work performed and all costs
 incurred, including mobilization of materials prior to said notification.
 1−82
 
 109.06 PARTIAL PAYMENTS.
 a. Amount. Partial payments will be made bi-weekly as the work progresses. The amount of
 the partial payments shall be 97 percent of the Contract price for the work performed during the previous
 payment period, all as measured and/or estimated and accepted by the Engineer. Partial payment will be
 subject to a 3 percent retainage.
 Retainage will be released when all items on the punch list and the required documentation have
 been addressed to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 No partial payments shall be made when, in the judgment of the Engineer, the work has not
 proceeded according to provisions of the Contract. Partial payments shall not be construed as an
 acceptance by the Department of any materials furnished or work performed.
 No partial payments shall be made on perishable plant materials until such plant materials are
 planted as specified in the Contract.
 Upon written request from the Contractor, supported by delivery invoices, and for those
 conditions outlined below, the Engineer may allow partial payment on such approved materials, supplies
 and equipment as are delivered to an approved site in acceptable condition. Such materials, supplies and
 equipment, as yet not incorporated into the work, shall be identified, set aside and suitably stored at or
 near the site of the work.
 b. Conditions. The conditions under which the Engineer may allow partial payments for those
 materials, supplies, and equipment not yet incorporated into the work include any of the following:
 1. The schedule of completion of the work has been terminated by authorized suspension of
 Contract work (pending final settlement), or
 2. The schedule of completion of the work has been hindered and delayed by seasonal closing of
 the project or by similar causes over which the Contractor has no control, or
 3. When, in the opinion of the Engineer, the advance delivery of such materials is in the best
 interest for the timely completion of the project.
 c. Maximum Payment. Under these conditions partial payments for such materials, supplies
 and equipment furnished at an approved site shall not exceed the lesser of the following amounts.
 1. 100 percent of the actual cost incurred by the Contractor, or
 2. 80 percent of the amount generated by the quantity of materials so delivered and accepted,
 multiplied by the unit price bid for such materials as contained in the Bid Schedule.
 Such payment shall be made as a partial payment under the related item or items by adjustment of
 the quantity progressively allowed. The Contractor must furnish a paid invoice for the furnished
 1−83
 
 materials, supplies or equipment within thirty (30) days after receiving the partial payment. Otherwise,
 the amount of the partial payment will be deducted from subsequent invoices.
 
 109.07 PARTIAL PAYMENT OF LUMP SUM ITEMS. Each bi-weekly period the Engineer and
 the Contractor will consult and subsequently agree on the progress of work performed under those lump
 sum items indicated in the Bid Schedule. Partial payments for the completed and accepted portions of
 such work will be made to the Contractor based on the Engineer's estimate of the value of said completed
 work.
 Prior to award of the Contract, or in any case within ten (10) calendar days after the date of the
 Notice of Award, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval two copies of the breakdown of
 each lump sum bid item that appears in the Bid Schedule, (excluding the Mobilization item). The
 breakdown of Lump Sum-Superstructure and Lump Sum-Substructure items shall include only those
 items listed on the Plans, and shall include the Contractor's verified quantities it used in preparing its bid.
 All other additional costs (such as engineering, shop drawings, formwork, equipment, etc.) to complete
 those items of work shall be included and distributed in the breakdown of those listed items. For other
 lump sum items not identified on the Plans, the Contractor shall provide a breakdown of the various items
 that constitute the respective lump sum work items.
 The Engineer will use as a guide the Lump Sum breakdowns submitted by the Contractor if they
 fairly represent the cost of the various items of work. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the prices
 submitted by the Contractor do not fairly represent the cost of the various items of work, the Engineer
 may substitute other prices that do fairly represent the cost of such work.
 
 109.08 PAYMENT OF WITHHELD FUNDS.
 a. Payment. Upon request, the Department will make payment of funds withheld from progress
 payments if the Contractor deposits, in escrow, securities eligible for the investment of State funds or
 bank certificates of deposit, upon the following conditions:
 1. The Contractor shall bear the expenses of the Department and the State Treasurer in
 connection with the escrow deposit made.
 2. Securities or certificates of deposit to be placed in escrow will be subject to the approval of the
 Department and, unless otherwise permitted by the escrow agreement, shall be of a value of at least 100
 percent of the amounts of retention to be paid to the Contractor pursuant to this Section.
 3. The Contractor shall enter into an escrow agreement satisfactory to the Department.
 4. The Contractor shall obtain the written consent of the Surety to the agreement.
 
 109.09 ACCEPTANCE AND FINAL PAYMENT. When the project has been accepted as provided
 in Subsection 105.17, the Engineer will prepare the final estimate of work performed. If the Contractor
 approves the final estimate or files no claim or objection to the quantities therein within 30 days of
 receiving the final estimate, the Department will process the estimate for final payment. With approval of
 1−84
 
 the final estimate by the Contractor, payment will be made for the entire sum found to be due after
 deducting all previous payments and all amounts to be retained or deducted under the provision of the
 Contract.
 If the Contractor files a claim in accordance with Contract requirements, it shall be submitted in
 writing in sufficient detail to enable the Engineer to ascertain the basis and amount of such claim. Upon
 final adjudication of the claim, any additional payment determined to be due the Contractor will be placed
 on a supplemental estimate and processed for payment.
 All prior partial estimates and payments will be subject to correction in the final estimate and
 payment.
 
 109.10 COMPENSATION FOR PROJECT DELAYS.
 a. Compensable Delays. The Department will provide an equitable adjustment to the Contractor
 for those delays created by the Department's acts or omissions. Unless otherwise specified, the
 Contractor assumes the risk of damages from all other causes of delay.
 The term "delay" shall be deemed to mean any event, action, force or factors which extends the
 Contractor's time of performance of the Contract. This Subsection is intended to cover all such events,
 actions, forces or factors, whether they be styled "delay,” "disruption,” "interference,” "impedance,”
 "hindrance" or otherwise.
 Strict compliance with the provisions of this Subsection will be an essential condition precedent
 to any equitable adjustment for delays.
 b. Limitation of Costs. Only the additional actual costs associated with the following items will
 be recoverable by the Contractor as an equitable adjustment for delays.
 1. Documented and substantiated additional or escalated job site non-salaried labor expenses.
 2. Documented and substantiated additional or escalated costs for materials.
 3. Documented and substantiated equipment costs or escalated equipment costs.
 When
 measuring additional equipment expenses (i.e., ownership expenses) arising as a direct result of a delay
 caused by the Department, use actual records kept in the usual course of business, and measure increased
 ownership expenses pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.
 4. Documented and substantiated extended job-site overhead to include those costs necessary
 to maintain the job site during the delay such as field office (inclusive of equipment, copy and fax
 machines, computers etc), field office utility bills (i.e. electricity, gas, water, etc.), field office supplies
 and janitorial services, and security. Under no circumstances will any of the contractor’s labor costs
 (inclusive of extended field labor) be paid under extended job-site overhead. Labor costs are paid subject
 to the conditions of No.b.1 and No.b.5 of this section.
 5. An additional surcharge of 10 percent of the total of items 1, 2, 3, and 4, to account for home
 office overhead as well as all salaried labor (both home office and extended field supervision), and profit.
 
 1−85
 
 Note: Where documentation, payment for equipment, and/or cost substantiation is specified, the
 Contractor shall adhere to the requirements in Section 109.04 of these Specifications. Payment for costs
 submitted for reimbursement will be made only to the extent that the requirements of Section 109.04 are
 met to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 c. Waiver of Liability. The parties agree that, in any adjustment for delay costs, the Department
 will have no liability for the following items of damages or expense:
 1. Profit in excess of that provided herein;
 2. Loss of profit;
 3. Labor inefficiencies;
 4. Home office overhead in excess of that provided herein;
 5. Consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of bonding capacity, loss of bidding
 opportunities and insolvency;
 6. Indirect costs or expenses of any nature;
 7. Attorneys fees, claims preparation expenses or costs of litigation.
 
 109.11 PROMPT PAYMENT PROCEDURES. In accordance with Title 42, Chapter 11.1-1 of the
 General Laws, all invoice vouchers submitted by the Contractor will be paid within thirty (30) days,
 provided however, that according to 42-11.1-5(B)2, the thirty (30) day period will not commence until the
 Department has reviewed and accepted all invoice documentation in its proper and approved form.
 
 109.12 SUBCONTRACTOR PROMPT PAYMENT. The Prime Contractor shall make prompt
 payment for satisfactory subcontract work for which the Department has made partial or full payment.
 The term “Subcontractor” as used herein, is defined in Subsection 101.70; Subcontractor.
 When a Subcontractor has not received payment for work paid to the Prime Contractor within 30days from receipt of the actual check by the Prime Contractor from the State, a formal complaint may be
 filed under the following procedures:
 a) The Subcontractor will send written notification to the Department, including contract item
 numbers, date work performed, a copy of the invoice(s) from the Subcontractor to the Prime, and a copy
 of the Progress Payment where payment to the Prime Contractor was included. The latter item may be
 obtained from the Department’s field supervisor or Construction Office. If the Subcontractor has not
 provided a payment/performance bond for this work to the contractor, then the formal complaint must
 also include verification that all suppliers and other debts on these items have been paid or documented
 reasons for non-payment acceptable by the Department. Failure to provide this verification will be
 considered “good cause” for postponement of payment by the Prime Contractor.
 b) The Department will notify the Prime Contractor of the formal complaint in writing within 15
 days and will proceed to withhold an amount equal to the previous payment(s) made to the Prime
 1−86
 
 Contractor for the specific subcontractor’s work. The Prime Contractor must submit written
 documentation to the Department demonstrating good cause for not making the required payment within
 15 days. If the Department does not receive the required documentation within the required 15 days or
 does not accept the Contractor’s good cause justification, the Department will withhold or continue to
 withhold an amount equal to all previous payments to the Prime Contractor for the specific
 Subcontractor’s work until the Department has verified payment to the Subcontractor. If the Department
 accepts the Prime Contractor’s good cause justification, it will notify the Subcontractor of its decision that
 this is categorized as a dispute and payment to the Prime Contractor will be released. The Subcontractor
 and Prime Contractor may solve their dispute in any fashion they so choose (arbitration, mediation,
 litigation, etc.). The cost of any such arbitration/mediation shall be borne by both parties at an equal
 share or as otherwise provided for in any agreement between the parties.
 c) Should the two parties enter into a payment agreement/settlement, the Department will only
 release previous monies held in accordance with the agreement/settlement. Should the Prime Contractor
 default again, the Department will contact the bonding company and request complete payment within 15
 days. Should the bonding company and/or Prime Contractor fail to make complete payment after a 15day period, all progress payments to the Prime Contractor will stop until the subcontractor is paid and the
 dispute is resolved to the satisfaction of the Department.
 Any delays and/or claims resulting from the actions taken by the Department under this
 Specification will not be the responsibility of the State.

 be wetted with water prior to breaking/cutting, depending on the requirements set forth by the
 selected landfill.
 4. The asbestos landfill sites listed in the Special Provisions may have different
 restrictions on the length of the AC pipe/duct bank which they accept for disposal. If the Contractor chooses to break or cut the AC pipe/duct bank to meet the length requirement of the accepted
 landfill, it shall be done inside the trench area before the pipe is removed.
 5. The AC pipe/duct bank shall be completely covered with a minimum 6-mil polyethylene
 sheet and/or bag fastened with high strength duct tape. The free ends of the sheeting or the end
 of the bag shall be folded outside and over the pipe/duct bank and be sealed transversely with
 the duct tape.
 6. The polyethylene sealed asbestos cement pipe shall be lifted intact without additional
 breaking and placed in a transport vehicle (box type trailer) which completely contains the
 wrapped and sealed portion of pipe/duct bank on all sides. A box trailer with tarpaulin top is not
 acceptable.
 7. Any remaining portions of AC material (i.e., pieces, fragments, collars, rubber gaskets,
 etc.) in the trench, overburden or work area, will be carefully collected and placed in a 6-mil
 polyethylene bag or sheeting. The bags or sheeted materials will be then placed in the manner
 of transport mentioned above. If the polyethylene bag or sheet is torn or punctured, the
 Contractor must repeat the above process to assure a sealed mode of handling at no additional
 cost to the Department.
 8. All of the removal and placement of the AC material into the transport truck shall be
 accomplished with the Department's assigned Resident Engineer and/or designated representative present at the site.
 9. The Contractor shall notify the Resident Engineer one week prior to the implementation

 SECTION 202
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 202.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of excavation, and the satisfactory placement and
 compaction, or disposal, of all materials encountered within the limits of the work and which are
 necessary for the construction of the roadway. Excavation and embankment shall be in
 reasonably close conformity with the dimensions and sections indicated on the Plans or as
 directed by the Engineer, all in accordance with these Specifications.
 Excavation will be classified as "earth excavation," "rock excavation," "rock excavation mechanical,” "muck excavation," "channel excavation-earth," "channel excavation-rock," "channel
 excavation rock-mechanical,” "loam excavation,” and "unclassified excavation,” all as hereafter
 described.
 202.01.1 Earth Excavation. Earth excavation shall include the removal of suitable and
 unsuitable soils not otherwise classified herein, and the removal of boulders and rock fragments
 less than 1 cubic yard in volume, from the following areas:
 a. Within the design excavation section.
 b. Beyond the design excavation section of the roadbed or side slopes where unsuitable
 materials are encountered.
 c. Beyond the design excavation section of shallow embankments when unsuitable
 materials are encountered.
 202.01.2 Presplitting Bedrock. This work shall consist of producing a plane of split rock prior
 to any drilling or blasting for roadway rock excavation. This plane will be formed to follow the
 design of rock slope lines and shall be extended from the top of the bedrock surface to the
 2-11
 
 proposed rock shelf levels and to the toe of finished rock slope, to the invert of side drains, or to
 the depths specified on the Plans.
 202.01.3 Rock Excavation. Rock excavation shall consist of the removal of intact bedrock, and
 boulders or detached bedrock fragments which have a volume of 1 cubic yard, or more. Boulders
 and detached rock fragments which have a volume of less than 1 cubic yard are considered
 "Earth Excavation.”
 202.01.4 Rock Excavation - Mechanical. This classification of rock excavation shall be
 employed in areas where blasting is prohibited. Rock excavated under this classification shall
 be removed by employing hydraulic splitters, air rams, paving breakers, or any other mechanical
 method approved by the Engineer.
 202.01.5 Unsuitable Soils. Unsuitable soils shall include and are hereby defined as those soils,
 other than muck, which due to their consolidation properties, degree of saturation, gradation, or
 other deleterious characteristics will not provide a stable subgrade or side slopes; cannot be used
 as, or support embankment, or cannot be placed and compacted as backfill, or do not otherwise
 conform to the requirements of these Specifications.
 202.01.6 Muck Excavation. Muck excavation shall consist of the removal and disposal of
 deposits of saturated or unsaturated mixtures of soils and organic matter not suitable for
 foundation material regardless of moisture content. The excavated muck shall be stockpiled at
 approved locations within the right-of-way and/or legally disposed of.
 202.01.7 Channel Excavation Earth. Channel excavation earth shall include all materials other
 than water or "Channel Excavation Rock," removed from existing, new, or temporary water
 courses as indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 202.01.8 Channel Excavation Rock. Channel excavation rock shall include intact bedrock and
 boulders 1 cubic yard or more in volume removed from existing, new, or temporary water
 courses, as indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 202.01.9 Channel Excavation Rock - Mechanical. This classification of rock excavation shall
 be employed in channel construction areas where blasting is prohibited. Rock excavation under
 this classification shall be removed by employing hydraulic splitters, air rams, paving breakers,
 or any other mechanical method approved by the Engineer.
 202.01.10 Loam Excavation. Loam excavation shall include loam or topsoil removed between
 the limits indicated and the depths specified on the Plans or directed by the Engineer. The
 excavated loam shall be stockpiled at approved locations within the right-of-way.
 202.01.11 Unclassified Excavation. Unclassified excavation shall consist of the excavation,
 stockpiling and/or removal and legal disposal of a composite mixture of various types of materials
 which the Engineer has determined to be impractical to segregate into separate classifications.
 202.01.12 Embankment Construction. Embankment construction shall consist of constructing
 roadway embankments, including preparation of the areas upon which they are to be placed; the
 benching of embankments; the construction of side slopes and toe drainage ditches; the
 construction of dikes within or outside the right-of-way; the placing and compacting of approved
 material within roadway areas where unsuitable material has been removed; and the placing and
 2-12
 
 compacting of embankment material in holes, pits and other depressions within the roadway area.
 Only approved materials shall be used in the construction of embankments and backfills.
 202.02 MATERIALS.
 202.02.1 Common Borrow. Common borrow shall consist of approved material required for
 the construction of embankments or for other portions of the work. Common Borrow shall be
 obtained from approved sources and shall meet the requirements of Subsection M.01.01 of
 these Specifications.
 202.02.2 Gravel Borrow. Gravel borrow shall meet the requirements of Subsection M.01.09;
 Gradation of Aggregates, Table I, Column I.
 202.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 202.03.1 Excavation-General. The Contractor shall remove all soil, rock, and other material
 and utilize or dispose of these materials as required by the Plans and these Specifications. The
 excavation for the roadway, intersections and entrances shall be finished to reasonably smooth
 and uniform surfaces. All rock cuts shall be thoroughly cleaned and scaled of all loose fragments.
 No materials shall be wasted without permission of the Engineer. Excavation operations shall
 be conducted so that material outside of the limits of slopes will not be disturbed. Prior to
 beginning excavation operations in any area, all necessary work in that area shall have been
 performed in accordance with SECTION 201; SITE PREPARATION, and all erosion and pollution
 controls shall have been installed in accordance with the applicable requirements of SECTIONS
 206 through 211 of these Specifications.
 The Contractor shall maintain slopes, crowns, berms, and ditches on all excavations to
 insure satisfactory drainage at all times to protect the work, and maintain safe working conditions.
 When the Contractor's excavating operations encounter remains or artifacts of potential
 historical or archaeological significance, the operations shall be temporarily discontinued. The
 Contractor will immediately contact the Engineer who will determine the disposition thereof.
 When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall excavate the site in such a manner as to
 preserve the artifacts encountered and shall remove them for delivery to the custody of the proper
 State authorities. Such excavation will be considered and paid for as Extra Work in accordance
 with Subsection 104.05 of these Specifications.
 a. Rock Excavation-General. Should bedrock be encountered above the design finish
 grade, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer of the change in classification. The
 Contractor shall then continue soil excavation to expose the bedrock surface and to allow the
 Engineer to perform the necessary elevation survey and take cross-sectional measurements.
 Prior to removal of overburden, or presplitting and blasting to excavate to the design rock
 slope face, the Contractor shall locate the presplit line, and the intersection of the crest of the
 design slope with existing ground surface. Elevations of existing ground surface along this
 intersection alignment shall be established at one-half station intervals or as directed by the
 Engineer. The Contractor shall install marker stakes at the directed station intervals, offset as
 directed by the Engineer.
 2-13
 
 Rock Excavation may be performed by blasting, where not prohibited, or by mechanical
 methods. However, where blasting is allowed, whatever the method used, bedrock removal shall
 be classified, measured and paid for as Rock Excavation.
 The Contractor shall be required to submit a Blasting Plan prior to the performance of any
 drilling or blasting. The Plan shall include as a minimum: full details of drilling and blasting
 patterns and techniques proposed for controlled and production blasting. The blasting plan is for
 quality control and record keeping purposes. Review of the blasting plan does not relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to use existing drilling and blasting technology and for obtaining
 the desired results.
 The Contractor shall be required to employ a qualified blasting supervisor, with presplitting
 experience acceptable to the Engineer. This supervisor shall be available, as required,
 throughout the duration of presplitting and fragmentation blasting rock excavation.
 Unless otherwise specified, material classified as rock shall be excavated to a minimum
 depth of 12 inches below subgrade within the limits of the roadbed, and the excavation backfilled
 with material as designated on the Plans or approved by the Engineer.
 Rock removal in excess of 12 inches below subgrade will not be paid for, but will be
 measured by the Engineer to determine excess backfill volume, said volume to be deducted from
 that backfill measured for payment. All backfilling in excess of the 12-inch depth shall be
 performed at the expense of the Contractor.
 1. Rock Excavation-Presplitting. When required, the Contractor shall presplit the rock
 along the designated cut face to produce a uniform plane of rupture, so that the resulting face will
 not be affected by subsequent fragmentation blasting and excavation operations, all in
 accordance with the limits designated or indicated on the Plans.
 Presplitting shall be used whenever the intended exposed rock slope exceeds 10 feet in
 vertical height. Rock cuts more than 25 feet in vertical height may be presplit in stages (lifts) at
 the option of the Contractor, provided, however, that no stage shall be less than 10 feet in depth,
 and further provided that no payment will be made for additional excavation quantities caused by
 the offsetting of presplitting holes beyond the specified face in the top or successive stages.
 Presplitting holes in successive stages shall be offset not more than 2 feet inside of the previously
 presplit stage face.
 When drilling and blasting behind existing previously drilled and blasted rock faces to
 widen the rock cut, the Contractor shall presplit along the new design rock face alignment and
 exercise all due care to prevent overblasting of the new rock face. If after excavating the blasted
 rock, it is not possible to hold a true and neat face-of-rock, then the Contractor will excavate all
 loose and unstable, fractured or seamed rock to an agreed stable face of rock behind the neat
 lines as ordered by the Engineer.
 The drilled presplitting holes shall follow the required rock slope lines and inclinations.
 Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, presplitting holes shall have a maximum spacing
 of 3 feet, center-to-center, and a diameter not greater than 3 inches.
 Presplitting holes shall be extended from the top of solid bedrock surface to 2 feet below
 the design toe of finished bedrock slope, unless different depths are specified on the Plans. The
 proper angle of drilling shall be maintained at all times so that all presplit holes lie essentially in
 2-14
 
 the same plane and are parallel to each other. No hole shall deviate more than one half-foot at
 any place in the plane of the specified slope line, nor in its vertical alignment.
 2. Rock Excavation-Fragmentation Blasting. The Contractor shall adjust his blasting
 operations according to the characteristics and structure of the rock formation to obtain the
 required slope without fracturing rock beyond the presplit face.
 (a) Fragmentation blast holes shall be positioned so that:
 •
 
 No portion of any blast hole 3 inches or less in diameter shall be within 4
 feet of the designated presplit face.
 
 •
 
 No portion of any blast hole greater than 3 inches in diameter shall be
 within 12 feet of the designated presplit face.
 
 (b) The Contractor shall inspect and test each hole for its entire depth to determine the
 possible presence of any obstruction prior to placing the charge. No loading shall be permitted
 until the hole is clear of all obstructions for its entire depth. All necessary precautions shall be
 used in placing the charge to prevent cave-in of material along the sidewall of the hole.
 All space in each hole not occupied by the explosive charge shall be filled with 3/8-inch
 size clean stone chips. No other material or type of stemming will be permitted.
 (c) Blasting for presplitting shall precede fragmentation blasting.
 (d) Remove the blast rock and expose the presplit face such that the surfaces of slopes
 in rock cuts are free from all loose stone or shattered edges.
 All unsuitable material, breakage, and slides, even though located beyond the payment
 lines, shall be removed as directed.
 b. Excavation of Unsuitable Materials. Where unsuitable soils are encountered within
 the excavated section and above the design finish grade, excavation shall be suspended to allow
 area measurements and survey of elevations across the exposed surface. Excavation of
 unsuitable soils shall then proceed until either a change of excavation classification occurs, or
 until the excavation reaches a stable base or as otherwise directed by the Engineer. If a change
 in classification occurs, a second set of surveyed elevations shall be obtained. The Engineer
 shall determine the required transverse spacing and station intervals of survey points.
 Where excavation to the designed subgrade elevation results in a subgrade or slopes of
 unsuitable soil, the Engineer shall require the Contractor to remove the unsuitable materials and
 backfill and compact to the designed subgrade elevation with approved material. The Contractor
 shall conduct his operations in such a way that the Engineer can take the necessary
 cross-sectional measurements before the backfill is placed.
 Material designated as unsuitable shall be legally disposed of at no additional cost to the
 State.
 Prior to placing of any subbase, base or pavement courses, all surplus excavated material
 including stumps, earth, rock, etc., shall be removed and the shoulders, ditches and slopes
 graded to approximate final lines.
 2-15
 
 c. Muck Excavation. If the unsuitable material involved is muck, the excavation will be
 accomplished without entrapping muck within the backfill. The backfilling of the excavation area
 shall proceed immediately behind the muck excavation so material that is displaced by the backfill
 can be removed. The excavation will be backfilled to the ground level or 3 feet above water level,
 whichever is higher, with rock or other suitable granular material selected from the roadway
 excavation. If suitable material is not available from the excavation, it will be obtained from other
 approved sources.
 d. Haulage. Compensation for haulage of earthwork materials within the project limits
 shall not be paid for separately, but shall be deemed to be included in the contract unit prices for
 the respective items.
 202.03.2 Embankment Construction-General. Embankment construction for roadways and
 associated ramps, dikes, and berms shall consist of the placement and compaction of suitable
 earth and rock excavation materials, or borrow material, as required. Construction of
 embankment may continue during cold weather, however, frozen soils shall be removed and shall
 not be permitted as fill for embankment. Rocks, broken concrete, or other solid materials shall
 not be placed in embankment areas where piling, guardrail, electrical poles, conduits, etc., are
 to be driven or placed.
 a. Preparation of Foundation. After cleaning and removal of topsoil where necessary,
 the Contractor shall notify the Engineer and prepare the embankment foundation as follows:
 1. Where embankment will be greater than 4 feet in height above existing ground, the
 Engineer shall determine whether preparation of the foundation will be necessary.
 2. For embankment less than 4 feet in height above existing ground, completely break
 up the cleared ground surface to a minimum depth of 6 inches by plowing or scarifying. Compact
 the existing ground surface in accordance with Subsection 202.03.3.
 3. Where unsuitable soils occur at existing ground surface, excavate and replace
 unsuitable soils with excavation or approved borrow material and compact in accordance with the
 applicable provisions of Subsection 202.03.3.
 4. Where embankment is less than 2 feet in height above an existing road surface,
 scarify or pulverize the existing roadway to a depth of 6 inches below the pavement surface.
 Reduce all particles to a maximum size of 6 inches and produce a uniform material. Compact
 the roadway surface in accordance with the applicable provisions of Subsection 202.03.3.
 b. Roadway Embankment-Earth. Roadway embankments may consist of earth
 excavation, common borrow, gravel borrow, or a combination thereof. Unless the Department
 mandates the sequencing of materials in the embankment, borrow material shall not be placed
 until all suitable and accessible materials from all structure, trench, and roadway excavations
 have been placed. If the Contractor places more borrow than is required and thereby causes a
 waste of excavation, the amount of such waste will be deducted from the borrow volume as
 measured.
 When borrow material is required to construct embankment, the Contractor shall make
 his own arrangements to procure the borrow or open a borrow source. The Contractor shall also
 determine the suitability of the borrow material for use in embankment by appropriate laboratory
 testing.
 2-16
 
 Roadway earth embankments shall be placed in horizontal layers not exceeding 12 inches
 (after compaction) and shall be compacted as specified in Subsection 202.03.3 before the next
 layer is placed.
 All earth embankment material shall be placed to the full width unless otherwise directed.
 The entire area of each layer shall be uniformly compacted to at least the required
 minimum density by use of compaction equipment consisting of rollers, compactors or a
 combination thereof. Earth-moving and other equipment not specifically manufactured for
 compaction purposes shall not be considered as compaction equipment.
 As the compaction of each layer progresses, continuous leveling and manipulating will be
 required to attain uniform density. Water shall be added or removed, if necessary, in order to
 obtain the required density. Construction equipment shall be routed uniformly over the entire
 surface of each layer.
 If the natural-in-place moisture of the excavated material makes it impractical to compact
 the soil, the Contractor shall dry the soil by disking, harrowing, blading or other approved means.
 If these methods do not produce the specified compaction, the Contractor shall strip and replace
 the soil.
 The embankment shall be crowned to shed runoff and constructed such that side slopes
 are protected from erosion.
 c. Roadway Embankment-Rock. Rock fragments or boulders to be used in the construction of embankments shall be reduced to segments with the maximum dimension not
 exceeding 36 inches. The rock fragments and boulders shall be so shaped and proportioned that
 they can be effectively bedded in the top of the existing ground surface or the preceding
 embankment layer. The rock fragments and boulders must be fully embedded in the placement
 layer which is not to exceed 3 feet in depth.
 Each rock fill layer shall be compacted using suitable equipment as described in
 Subsection 202.03.3; Para. a.
 Individual boulders may be placed in embankment. However, boulders shall not be
 nested, and the Contractor shall use appropriate methods and equipment as required to
 satisfactorily embed boulders in soil lifts and to compact adjacent fill.
 Each layer shall be leveled with suitable equipment and the interstices filled with finer
 fragments and earth. The rock lifts shall not be constructed above an elevation 2 feet below the
 finished subgrade. The balance of the embankment shall be composed of suitable material
 compacted as specified herein.
 d. Excess Materials. All excess or unsuitable excavated material, including rock and
 boulders, that cannot be used in embankments may be placed in a satisfactory manner on the
 side slopes of the nearest fill. In case it is impossible to dispose of all such material in the
 manner described above, the remainder shall be legally disposed of by the Contractor at no
 additional cost to the State.
 
 2-17
 
 e. Benching Existing Embankments. When embankment is to be placed and
 compacted against either an existing embankment or slope steeper than 4-to-1, horizontal
 benches shall be cut into the existing slopes to a sufficient width to accommodate placing and
 compaction operations and equipment. The Contractor shall bench the slope as each
 embankment layer is placed and compacted. Each bench shall begin at the intersection of the
 original ground and the vertical cut of the previous bench.
 Benches may be cut to a maximum height of 3 feet. Embankment layers shall be placed
 and compacted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Subsection 202.03.3. There will
 be no separate payment for providing benches other than under the appropriate excavation
 classification.
 f. Embankment Against Structures. If embankment can be deposited on one side only
 of abutments, wing walls, piers or culvert headwalls, care shall be taken that the area immediately
 adjacent to the structure is not compacted to the extent that it will cause overturning of or
 excessive pressure against the structure. When noted on the Plans, the fill adjacent to the
 abutment of a bridge shall not be placed higher than the bottom of the backwall of the abutment
 until the superstructure is in place. When embankment is to be placed on both sides of a
 concrete wall or box type structure, operations shall be so conducted that the embankment is
 always at approximately the same elevation on both sides of the structure. In addition to these
 requirements, refer to Subsection 203.03.5; Backfilling, of these Specifications.
 g. Embankment Below Prevailing Water Level. Backfilling and compacting excavated
 muck areas below prevailing water level may be accomplished as directed by the Engineer until
 the excavated area is backfilled to an initial loose state level not more than 3 feet above the
 prevailing water level.
 Embankments to an elevation 3 feet above the free water surface at the time of filling shall
 be constructed of rock, or a free-draining granular material as approved by the Engineer.
 Where filling in 12-inch layers is impracticable as may be the case of filling in water, the
 Engineer may allow embankment to be constructed in one layer to the minimum elevation at
 which equipment can be operated. Above this elevation, the embankment shall be constructed
 as specified in Subsections 202.03.2b and 202.03.3.
 h. Drainage Extension Embankment Detail. On projects which call for the extension
 of existing drainage lines in excavation and embankment areas, the Contractor shall maintain
 the flow of water throughout the construction process. In such cases, the following method of
 construction shall apply up to a minimum height of 3 feet above the outside diameter of the
 pipe:
 1. Embankment will be constructed to an elevation equal to the invert elevation.
 2. Trench excavation will be performed in the compacted embankment for the placing of
 pipe bedding. The width of trench excavation will be governed by the dimensions specified in
 SECTION 205; TRENCH EXCAVATION.
 3. A layer of bedding material will be placed against the outside of the pipe, its width
 governed by the horizontal pay limits of trench excavation. Outside of these limits common
 2-18
 
 borrow will be placed. Each fill layer will not exceed a thickness of 8 inches, measured after
 compaction.
 4. The bedding material will extend to the height specified under SECTION 701;
 CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS.
 202.03.3 Compaction-General. Each layer shall be uniformly compacted to the specified
 density before the next layer is placed. The specified density shall be obtained by utilizing any
 approved compaction equipment such as: pneumatic tired compaction equipment, or threewheeled power rollers, or vibratory, sheepsfoot, or tamping rollers, or other approved types of
 compaction equipment.
 Dumping and rolling areas shall be kept separate, and no lift shall be covered by another
 until the compaction requirements of this Subsection have been met. Hauling and leveling
 equipment shall be routed and distributed over each layer of the fill so as to make best use of that
 compaction effort.
 a. Densities.
 1. Maximum density will be determined by AASHTO T180.
 2. Field density of soil in place shall be determined by either AASHTO T191 or a nuclear
 moisture density gauge conforming to AASHTO T238 and T239.
 3. The method of correcting for oversize particles in soil compaction test results shall
 conform to AASHTO T224.
 b. Compaction of Earth Embankment.
 1. Subgrade. The resulting subgrade surface shall be compacted as required, to not
 less than 95 percent of maximum density, measured to a depth of 12 inches below the surface.
 2. Embankment Sections. Earth in embankment sections below a plane of three feet
 below subgrade shall be compacted to not less than 90 percent of maximum density. The
 remainder of the roadway section up to subgrade shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum
 density.
 c. Compaction of Rock Embankment. Rock fill layers shall be sized, placed, and
 choked as described in Subsection 202.03.2; Para. c.
 202.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 202.04.1 Excavation-General. The types of excavation specified in this Section will be
 measured on a volume basis as computed from the area in its original position. The volume will
 be determined by differencing the area to be excavated from its original position before
 excavation is begun to the design subgrade after excavation is completed. Differencing will be
 accomplished by taking cross sections at intervals stated herein by standard field survey
 techniques. Two sets of cross sections will be taken over the area to be excavated; one set of
 2-19
 
 the area in its original position and a final set after completion of excavation. (Intermediate sets
 of cross sections may be authorized for progress payment purposes).
 Should the final set of cross sections indicate unauthorized excavation below the design
 subgrade, the excess excavation shall not be measured for payment. However, the excess
 excavation shall be replaced by available suitable excavation or borrow material, all provided,
 placed and compacted at no cost to the State.
 The final set of cross sections may include an amount for overbreakage or slides, as
 subsequently defined, which in the judgment of the Engineer were not caused by any
 carelessness on the part of the Contractor.
 The cross sections will then be plotted and the volume determined by either the average
 end-area method or such other equivalent method acceptable to the Engineer.
 a. Earth Excavation. Earth excavation shall be measured by the cubic yard as
 calculated by differencing the area excavated from its original position before earth excavation
 is begun to its position when:
 1.
 
 There has occurred a change in classification of excavation; or
 
 2.
 
 The design subgrade elevation has been reached; or
 
 3.
 
 The approved limits of excavation of unsuitable soils below design subgrade
 elevation or behind design side slopes are reached; or
 
 4.
 
 The approved limits of excavation of unsuitable soils under shallow embankment
 have been reached.
 
 Area differencing shall be conducted by taking cross sections as described above in this
 Subsection 202.04.1.
 b. Presplit Bedrock. Presplitting of bedrock shall be measured by the number of square
 yards of area of presplit rock face along the alignment at the inclination designated on the Plans.
 This area shall be measured and calculated as follows:
 At one-half station locations, the distance from the top of the presplit face to the toe of the
 presplit face, including toe drain, shall be measured using a steel tape held taut and against the
 top and toe of slope. One-half station areas shall be calculated by multiplying the average of
 adjacent one-half station measurements by a one-half station horizontal distance. The total
 measurement for presplitting will be calculated by summing the one-half station areas.
 c. Rock Excavation and Rock Excavation - Mechanical. When rock surface occurs
 above the design grade of bottom of excavation, the Contractor shall immediately notify the
 Engineer so that determinations of the initial surface elevation and area of rock exposure can be
 made for preparation of cross sections for measurement for payment. Cross sections for rock
 excavation measurement shall be prepared at maximum spacing of one-half stations (50 feet).
 At the completion of rock excavation and clearing of loose fragments, a second set of elevations
 shall be determined for the excavated and cleared rock surface.
 2-20
 
 The volume of rock excavation and rock excavation-mechanical to be measured for
 payment shall be calculated from the difference between the cross-sectional surface elevations,
 using the average end-area method or such other equivalent method acceptable to the Engineer.
 Volume calculated for payment shall include overbreakage of up to 12 inches below the
 design bottom of excavation in rock as described in Subsection 202.03.1; Para. a. Should the
 cross sections indicate bottom overbreakage and excavation in excess of the 12-inch allowance,
 the Contractor shall not be paid for rock excavation in excess of the overbreakage allowance.
 However, he shall provide, place, and compact fill and/or borrow required to replace the excess
 overbreakage at no cost to the State.
 Except for presplit areas, measurement for payment for rock excavation or rock
 excavation-mechanical shall include an allowance for overbreakage along rock side slopes to an
 amount not to exceed, in any half-station of 50 feet, 10 percent of the actual quantity of rock
 excavation measured and calculated for that half-station. Rock side slope overbreakage in
 excess of the allowance will not be included for payment and shall be removed by the Contractor
 at no cost to the State.
 This Subsection 202.04.1; Para. c also applies to Channel Rock Excavation and Channel
 Rock Excavation-Mechanical.
 Rock Excavation in presplit areas shall be measured to the presplit face or design limits,
 whichever is less. Overbreakage from blasting will not be measured for payment but shall be
 removed as directed at no additional cost to the State.
 202.04.2 Embankments. When the Contract specifically provides for payment for embankments, or when embankments are constructed with material obtained from sources other than
 excavation, embankment will be measured by the number of cubic yards of material actually
 placed and compacted within the limits of the design embankment section. The in-place volume
 will be calculated by differencing cross sections taken along the original ground from those taken
 along the top of the completed embankment. The two sets of cross sections will then be plotted
 and the volume determined by either the average end-area method or such other equivalent
 method approved by the Engineer.
 All boulders and detached stones which have a volume in excess of 1 cubic yard and
 which the Contractor desires to incorporate into embankment construction must first be broken
 up into fragments whose respective volumes are 1 cubic yard or less. There will be no additional
 payment for breaking up such boulders and stones.
 When the Contract does not specifically provide for payment for embankment, or when
 embankments are constructed with material obtained solely from excavation, the work of
 embankment construction will not be measured or paid for separately, but will be considered
 incidental to the various classifications of excavation.
 However, when embankment is constructed from excavation material and there is required
 borrow material to complete the embankment, this borrow material shall be measured for
 payment.
 
 2-21
 
 Appurtenances, structures, pipes and drainage structures less than 50 cubic yards in
 volume shall not be deducted from embankment volumes for measurement of embankment or
 measurement of borrow for embankment.
 202.04.3 Measurement of Borrow. Common Borrow, Gravel Borrow, or other borrow
 approved for use to replace unsuitable materials removed by excavation, or to construct
 embankment, shall be measured by the cubic yard as in-place and compacted. This volume shall
 be determined by area differencing using cross sections as described in Subsection 202.04.1;
 Excavation-General.

 Contract.
 
 2-23
 
 203.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 203.03.1 Excavation.
 a. Notification. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer sufficiently in advance of the
 beginning of excavation, and immediately when it believes there is a change in classification of
 structure excavation, in order that cross-sectional elevations and measurements may be taken
 of the undisturbed ground.
 b. Dimensions of Excavation. The excavation for footings shall be of sufficient size
 to accommodate both the placement of the structure as indicated on the Plans and the placement
 and compaction of backfill. Excavation shall extend at least 2 feet horizontally beyond the vertical
 face of footings, and a minimum of 12 inches below the base of footings.
 c. Change in Elevation or Dimension of Excavation. The elevation of the bottoms of
 excavations shall be as indicated on the Plans. However, the Engineer may direct the Contractor
 to make such changes in the elevation or dimensions of the excavation as may be necessary to
 secure a satisfactory foundation.
 Whenever such additional work as described above effects changes in quantities involving
 items designated in the Contract, the provisions relating to such items as specified under
 SECTION 104; SCOPE OF WORK, will apply.
 d. Approval of Foundation. No formwork or permanent work shall commence until after
 the Engineer has approved the depth and dimensions of the excavation, the character of the
 material and the condition of the foundation. Sounding rods shall be driven at such points and
 to such depths as may be directed by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide assistance to the Engineer as may be necessary to make an
 adequate inspection of the foundation material. No extra compensation will be allowed for
 providing this assistance.
 All unsheathed excavation shall have sufficient side slopes to prevent earth sliding in on
 the work.
 e. Utilization of Excavated Materials. All suitable excavated material shall be utilized
 as backfill or in embankments. Surplus excavation or unsuitable materials may be either
 disposed of in non-critical areas within the project limits or legally disposed of.
 f. Blasting. All blasting in connection with rock excavation within project limits shall be
 completed before the placing of any structure concrete unless an exception is granted by the
 Engineer in writing.
 g. Alternatives & Unsatisfactory Bearing Surfaces. Whenever in the opinion of the
 Engineer the natural foundation material is inadequate to safely support the structure, the
 Contractor shall proceed with alternative methods as directed by the Engineer. Where not
 otherwise listed in the Proposal, such operations shall be considered "Extra Work,” and paid for
 in accordance with Subsection 104.05 of these Specifications.
 h. Water. When water is encountered, provisions shall be made for draining or
 dewatering within the excavation. The dewatering work shall be accomplished by means that will
 2-24
 
 prevent disturbing the bottoms of excavations or adjacent structures. When foundation material
 is relatively impermeable, such that water accumulations tend to soften the cementing material
 or puddle the surface, provisions shall be made to drain the excavation by suitable channels
 outside of, and slightly below, the footing level. These channels shall conduct the water to
 outfalls or sump pumps. Foundation material unduly disturbed or softened by the use of
 equipment or by inadequate handling of water shall be removed and replaced with material
 satisfactory to the Engineer and at the Contractor's expense.
 i. Preparation of Bearing Surface. All rock or other hard foundation material shall be
 freed from all loose material, cleaned and cut to a firm surface, either level, stepped or serrated
 as directed by the Engineer. All seams shall be properly cleaned out and filled with concrete
 mortar or grout. All shaping of ledge rock shall be carefully executed to avoid any unnecessary
 excavation of sound rock. No payment for overbreak will be allowed except as provided under
 Subsection 203.04; Method of Measurement.
 203.03.2 Cofferdams. Cofferdams shall be utilized when the bottoms of excavation are below
 the prevailing water surface. Cofferdams, when specified or required in order to dewater such
 excavations, shall consist of timber, steel sheet piling, cylindrical metal shells or other structural
 components. Earthen embankments and dikes will not be classified as cofferdams.
 a. Shop Drawings. For substructure work, the Contractor shall submit drawings
 showing his proposed method of cofferdam construction and other details left open to his choice
 or not fully shown on the Plans. Such drawings shall be approved by the Engineer before
 construction is started, but such approval shall not in any way relieve the Contractor of his
 responsibility under the Contract, to secure a safe and satisfactory cofferdam. Shop drawings
 shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with Subsection 105.02; Plans and Shop
 Drawings, of these Specifications.
 b. Construction. Cofferdams for foundation construction shall, in general, be well braced
 and as watertight as practicable. The interior dimensions of cofferdams shall be such as to give
 sufficient clearance for the construction of forms and the inspection of their exteriors, and to
 permit dewatering outside of the forms. Where piles are required, the cofferdam shall be of
 sufficient size to permit the driving of the piles in the exact positions shown on the Plans without
 interference from the wales or bracing or requiring excessive rebracing. Cofferdams which are
 tilted or moved laterally during the process of installation shall be righted, reset or enlarged to
 provide the necessary clearance. These corrective measures shall be made at the sole expense
 of the Contractor.
 Cofferdams shall be constructed and dewatered to protect green concrete against damage
 from water and to prevent damage to the foundation by erosion.
 No construction materials shall be left in cofferdams in such a way as to extend into the
 substructure masonry.
 c. Tremie Seal. Cofferdams shall be dewatered and the foundations shall be placed in
 the dry. Well point systems and methods will be approved at suitable locations, if required.
 However, when conditions are anticipated which would render it impractical to dewater the
 cofferdam before placing masonry, a tremie seal shall be placed both in accordance with
 Subsection 808.03.5; Para. f of these Specifications, and to the dimensions shown on the Plans.
 
 2-25
 
 During the placing of a tremie seal and until the seal has set, the elevation of the water
 inside the cofferdam shall be controlled to prevent any flow through the seal.
 Pumping to dewater a sealed cofferdam of the gravity type shall not commence until the
 concrete seal has been in place for at least 3 days for spread footing foundations, and at least
 7 days for pile-supported foundations.
 After dewatering, the balance of the foundations shall be placed in the dry, with such
 modifications as may be necessary for structural purposes.
 d. Removal of Cofferdams. Unless otherwise provided, cofferdams including all
 sheeting and bracing, shall be removed by the Contractor as directed by the Engineer. The
 removal operation shall be effected in such manner to not disturb or otherwise damage the work.
 The Contractor shall not remove cofferdams without prior notification and approval of the
 Engineer.
 If the cofferdam is to remain in place, it shall be vented or ported below low water level
 when dewatering is no longer necessary.
 203.03.3 Dewatering. Dewatering from the interior of any foundation enclosure shall be carried
 out in such manner as to preclude the possibility of movement of water through any fresh
 concrete. No pumping will be permitted during the placing of concrete or for a period of at least
 24 hours thereafter, unless it be done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete work by
 a mortar-tight form, bulkhead, or other effective means.
 203.03.4 Embankments Under Structure Foundations. Embankments under stub abutments,
 walls, culverts, footings, and other foundations where stability requirements are essential shall
 be constructed of gravel borrow conforming to Subsection M.01.09, Table I, Column I, except
 that the material shall not contain particles greater than 6 inches maximum dimension.
 Embankments shall be constructed such that side slopes are sufficiently stable, and such
 that the widths of embankments shall extend horizontally 2 feet beyond the vertical faces of
 footings. The gravel borrow shall be placed in layers not exceeding 12 inches in depth before
 compaction and shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by
 AASHTO T180.
 Embankments under pile supported foundations shall be compacted to 90 percent of
 maximum density as determined by AASHTO T180.
 203.03.5 Backfilling.
 a. Protection of Structures During Backfilling. No fill material shall be placed against
 any structure until permission to place fill has been granted by the Engineer and in no case until
 the masonry has obtained the 28-day compressive strength or unless otherwise specified in the
 Special Provisions.
 In all cases proper precautions shall be taken to assure that the method of backfilling
 does not cause movement of or undue strain on any part of the structure. Fill material shall be
 deposited and compacted behind abutments, walls and miscellaneous structures as
 hereinbefore specified. Special precautions shall be taken when placing fill around slender
 foundations, rigid frame legs, piers or over and around arches and box culverts, to deposit the
 2-26
 
 material on both sides of such structures to approximately the same elevation at the same
 time.
 Backfill materials shall be carefully placed to avoid damage to masonry and waterproofing
 treatments. If backfilling or other operations do in fact damage masonry or waterproofing, the
 Contractor shall remove the backfill and replace or repair the damaged work or waterproofing at
 the direction of the Engineer. All such repairs, replacement of materials, and labor shall be
 provided at no additional cost to the State.
 b. Pervious Fill Adjacent to Structures. The material placed adjacent to, or in contact
 with arches, culverts, retaining walls, wingwalls, secondary structures, and other areas indicated
 on the Plans shall be pervious fill.
 Pervious fill shall be placed in layers not over 12 inches in depth before compaction and
 shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by AASHTO T180. In those
 locations not accessible for normal placing and rolling and for minor operations, pervious fill shall
 be placed in lifts not to exceed 8 inches and compacted by means of mechanical tampers, or
 suitable vibratory equipment. For minor operations, hand tamping with heavy iron tampers may
 be used.
 c. Common Backfill. All spaces excavated and not occupied by permanent works,
 pervious fill, or gravel borrow, shall be backfilled with suitable material, such material to be
 compacted in 1-foot lifts up to the surface of the surrounding ground.
 Suitable material shall be free of vegetative matter, organic or compressible soils, and
 shall meet the requirements for Common Borrow except that the material shall not contain
 particles larger than 6 inches. The Engineer may approve excavated soil for re-use as suitable
 material.
 The surface shall then be neatly graded. Backfill shall be compacted to 95 percent of
 maximum density as determined by AASHTO T180. No separate payment will be made for this
 work.
 203.03.6 Crushed Stone Fill Under Structures. The crushed stone shall be placed and
 compacted on a prepared surface to the required thickness indicated on the Plans. A filter fabric
 must be placed between the crushed stone and surrounding soils. The surface of the crushed
 stone must be placed in such a manner that a reasonably uniform texture is provided. The
 surface will have a tolerance of ½-inch, plus or minus, to the grade indicated on the Plans and/or
 as directed by the Engineer.
 203.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 203.04.1 Structure Excavation. Structure excavation of the various classifications will be
 measured by the number of cubic yards of the respective materials actually removed in
 accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer. The volume will be computed by
 taking the difference in elevation between the existing ground surface or the bottom of roadway
 excavation or channel excavation, whichever is lower, and the surface of the completed structure
 excavation at plan grade or approved revised plan grade all between the designated horizontal
 pay lines.
 2-27
 
 Structure excavation in roadway cuts, or embankment areas where the removal of muck
 is indicated on the Plans shall include only that portion below the bottom of the muck.
 Structure excavation in roadway cuts shall include only that portion below the subgrade,
 shoulder foundations, and cut slope lines, or as specifically indicated on the Plans.
 When bedrock, boulders, or masonry are encountered, the Contractor shall notify the
 Engineer and shall expose the same to such an extent that in the Engineer's opinion the
 necessary measurements can be taken for structure excavation. If the Contractor shall fail to give
 such notice or notices, or removes any material prior to the taking of measurements, the Engineer
 shall presume that measurements taken at the time the Engineer first sees the material in
 question will give the true quantity of excavation.
 a. Pay Lines. Horizontal payment limits will be measured between plumb lines and 2
 feet outside of the neat lines of the original foundations only as shown on the Plans. However,
 should the size of the footing be increased more than 2 feet in any direction, the area of the
 footing that extends beyond the original payment lines, as established hereinbefore, will be used
 for determining the additional amount of excavation.
 No allowance for rock overbreak will be made beyond the above limits or more than 6
 inches below bottom of footing, unless indicated otherwise on the Plans.
 203.04.2 Pervious Fill, Gravel Borrow, and Common Borrow. "Pervious Fill,” "Gravel
 Borrow,” and "Common Borrow" will be measured by the number of cubic yards actually placed
 in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 203.04.3 Crushed Stone Fill Under Structures. “Crushed Stone Fill Under Structures” will be
 measured by the number of cubic yards actually placed in accordance with the Plans and/or as
 directed by the Engineer.
 203.04.4 Cofferdams. Cofferdams do not require a measurement for payment.
 203.04.5 Tremie Seals. When underwater concrete is specified, the horizontal and vertical
 payment limits will be those specified for the tremie seal as indicated on the Plans. When
 underwater concrete is not specified, but is required, the horizontal payment limits will be
 extended to the actual inside face of the cofferdam, and the vertical payment limits will be
 established by the Engineer.

 SECTION 205
 TRENCH EXCAVATION
 205.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of the excavation, dewatering, and backfill, or
 disposal, of all materials required for the construction of box culverts, pipe culverts, storm drains,
 drainage structures, utilities, utility structures and ditches in reasonably close conformity with the
 dimension and details indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer, all in accordance
 with these Specifications.
 Trench excavation also includes the provision of temporary or permanent trench protection
 as indicated on the Plans and as specified herein.
 Trench excavation will be subdivided into the following four classifications:
 205.01.1 Trench Excavation; Earth. Trench excavation; earth shall consist of all trench
 excavation not otherwise classified.
 205.01.2 Trench Excavation; Rock. Trench excavation; rock shall consist of the removal of
 bedrock and boulders or detached rock fragments which have a volume of ½ cubic yard or more.
 Boulders and detached fragments which have a volume of less than ½ cubic yard are considered
 Trench Excavation; Earth.
 205.01.3 Trench Rock Excavation - Mechanical. This classification of trench rock excavation
 shall be employed in areas where blasting is prohibited. Trench rock excavated under this
 classification shall be removed by employing hydraulic splitters, air rams, paving breakers, or any
 other mechanical methods approved by the Engineer.
 205.01.4 Ditches. Ditches at inlets and outlets of culverts and any other ditches and waterways,
 except those within normal cut and fill slopes, indicated in the Plans shall be excavated under the
 applicable trench excavation items.
 205.02 MATERIALS. Not applicable.
 205.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 205.03.1 Excavation of Trenches. All unsuitable material shall be excavated to a minimum
 depth of 12 inches below the design invert elevation or as directed by the Engineer. For all pipe
 up to 36 inches in diameter, the width of the trench shall extend 2 feet beyond each side of the
 inside diameter of the pipe. For pipe greater than 36 inches in diameter, trenches shall be
 excavated to 30 inches on each side of the inside diameter of the pipe.
 The material to replace this excavation shall consist of suitable bedding placed and
 compacted under and around the pipe to the horizontal and vertical dimensions indicated on the
 Plans or stated in the Special Provisions. Bedding material may be from suitable trench or
 roadway excavation material. Backfill placed above the bedding may be from suitable trench or
 roadway excavation material, provided it meets the minimum requirements for Common Borrow.
 2-32
 
 Common borrow will be used to replace unsuitable material when no excess suitable material is
 available from on-site.
 The Contractor shall shape the surface of bedding material along the bottom of the trench
 to fit the bell of pipes to a depth equal to the thickness of the pipe or bell, as directed by the
 Engineer.
 205.03.2 Trench Protection. Should trench protection be required in accordance with either
 OSHA Regulations or for the protection of the roadway or utilities, the Contractor will be required
 to provide adequate timber sheeting, steel sheeting or steel box type sheeting acceptable to the
 Engineer. Should the Contract specifically require trench protection of any nature for drainage
 trenches not requiring protection under OSHA Regulations, such use will be specified on the
 construction Plans.
 Sheeting shall be either timber of 3-inch minimum thickness; steel sheet piling or a
 fabricated steel trench box. Except when fabricated steel trench boxes have been approved for
 use by the Engineer, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, for approval, shop drawings and
 computations showing the method and design of the sheeting proposed for use. Shop drawings
 shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with Subsection 105.02; Plans and Shop
 Drawings, of these Specifications.
 Sheeting and supporting systems shall be designed to meet acceptable engineering
 criteria and must be certified by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer. The Engineer's approval of shop drawings shall not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility under the
 Contract for successful completion of the work. The Engineer's written approval of a sheeting
 design will be required prior to the use of any sheeting on the project and prior to commencement
 of any drainage or underground utility work.
 In all cases where sheeting is to be left in place, it shall be cut off a distance of 2 feet
 below subgrade unless otherwise required to support adjacent utilities and structures whose
 elevation is above the aforementioned cut off. The Contractor will not be allowed to use
 fabricated steel trench boxes where the Contract requires the use of either permanent steel or
 permanent timber sheeting.
 The Contractor will be required to protect any and all structures (drainage or otherwise)
 and unsupported utilities encountered in the trench.
 Unless otherwise indicated on the Plans or directed by the Engineer, all sheeting and
 bracing used in conjunction with trench excavation shall be removed by the Contractor following
 the completion of the work.
 205.03.3 Open Cuts in Lieu of Trenches. Should the Contractor elect to excavate to the angle
 of repose as specified in OSHA 2226 (Excavation and Trenching Operations) and the lines of
 angle of repose intersect the ground beyond the pay limits of trench excavation as described
 subsequently in Subsection 205.04.2, any required additional excavation, disposal of unsuitable
 material, backfill, borrow, compaction, replacement of pavement structure, curb, sidewalk, lawn
 area, etc., will be completely at the Contractor's expense. All replacement work shall match the
 existing in kind. This provision is applicable only if the requirements for the Maintenance and
 Protection of Traffic are met to the satisfaction of the Engineer and when trench protection is not
 indicated on the Plans.
 2-33
 
 205.03.4 Dewatering. Trench excavation shall be maintained dry at all times and all
 construction work shall be performed in the dry unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. The
 Contractor shall remove by pumping, draining, bailing, well points, deep wells, or other approved
 method, any water which may accumulate in the trenches formed under this Contract and shall
 form all pump wells, sumps, dams, flumes, or other works required to keep the trenches clear of
 water while pipe and structures are being constructed.
 The Contractor shall exercise caution to avoid loss of fines into bedding, boiling up of the
 trench bottoms, or other disturbances that may cause subsidence or loss of strength of the
 underlying natural soils. If the dewatering procedure being used results in boiling, loss of fines,
 or other detrimental effects, the Contractor shall modify its operations to correct the situation.
 Damage caused by the dewatering operation will be repaired at the Contractor's expense.
 All water from the trench excavations, including water discharged from pumping systems
 and underdrains, shall be removed and legally disposed of.
 205.03.5 Backfill and Compaction. Backfill shall consist of suitable bedding and soil materials
 placed and compacted in layers. These layers shall be compacted to not less than 95 percent
 of maximum density according to AASHTO T180 and shall be no more than 8 inches thick after
 compaction.
 Compaction shall be achieved in accordance with the applicable provisions of Subsection
 202.03.3 of these Specifications. Unless otherwise directed, the backfill shall be brought to the
 surface level of the surrounding ground and neatly graded.
 No backfill shall be placed against newly constructed masonry or concrete structures
 unless authorized by the Engineer.
 205.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 205.04.1 Trench Excavation; Earth. "Trench Excavation; Earth" will not be measured for
 payment.
 205.04.2 Trench Excavation; Rock and Trench Rock Excavation - Mechanical. "Trench
 Excavation; Rock" and "Trench Rock Excavation - Mechanical" will be measured by the cubic
 yard in its original position within the following horizontal and vertical pay limits:
 a. Horizontal Pay Limits. For all pipe up to and including 36 inches in diameter,
 measurement will be made between parallel vertical planes located 2 feet on each side of the
 inside diameter of the pipe.
 For all pipe greater than 36 inches, measurement will be made between parallel vertical
 planes located 30 inches on each side of the inside diameter of the pipe.
 The length of the trench will be measured from 1 foot beyond the outside face of a
 drainage structure to 1 foot beyond the outside face of the adjacent drainage structure.
 b. Vertical Pay Limits in Cut Areas. Within the limits of Roadway Excavation, payment
 lines will extend vertically from one foot below the pipe to the subgrade.
 2-34
 
 Outside the limits of Roadway Excavation, payment lines will extend vertically from one
 foot below the pipe to existing ground surface.
 c. Vertical Pay Limits in Fill. Within the limits of fill areas, payment lines will extend
 vertically from invert elevation to a maximum cover of approximately 3 feet of fill over the pipe.
 205.04.3 Sheeting for Trench Protection.
 a. Steel Sheeting. Temporary steel sheeting, temporary steel sheeting abandoned in
 place, and/or permanent steel sheeting will be measured for payment only if such sheeting is
 specifically called for on the Plans. In such cases, "Temporary Steel Sheeting," “Temporary Steel
 Sheeting Abandoned in Place,” and/or "Permanent Steel Sheeting" will be measured by the
 number of square feet calculated according to the following dimensions: The height shall be the
 distance from the ground surface or the top of sheeting, whichever is less, to 2 feet below the
 bottom of the excavation. The length of steel sheeting shall be the continuous length measured
 as described below in Para. c of this Subsection.
 b. Timber Sheeting. Temporary timber sheeting and/or permanent timber sheeting will
 be measured for payment only if such sheeting is specifically called for on the Plans. In such
 cases, "Temporary Timber Sheeting" and/or "Permanent Timber Sheeting" will be measured by
 the number of square feet calculated according to the following dimensions: The height shall be
 the distance determined using the vertical pay limits described above in Para. a of this
 Subsection. The length of timber sheeting shall be the continuous length measured as described
 below in Para. c of this Subsection.
 c. Prohibition Against Odd Shapes. The inside face of sheeting will be the plane of
 the horizontal pay limit for trench excavation as noted in, Subsection 205.04.2; Para. a.
 Regardless of the type of sheeting used, timber or steel, measurement will be on the horizontal
 plane area, not on any odd shapes developed by the sheeting by virtue of its cross-sectional
 configurations.
 d. Open Cuts in Lieu of Trenches. No measurement will be made for additional
 excavation, disposal of unsuitable material, borrow, compaction, or replacement of site features
 should the Contractor elect to excavate to the angle of repose in lieu of installing trench
 protection.
 205.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT.
 205.05.1 Trench Excavation; Earth. There will be no direct payment for trench excavation;
 earth required for the installation of drainage pipes, pipe culverts, ditches, utilities or minor
 structures such as drop inlets, manholes and catch basins or for shaping trenches relative to
 drainage installations. The cost of such excavation, including dewatering, shall be included in the
 respective contract unit prices listed in the Proposal for the various classifications of pipe, ditches,
 and drainage/utility structures.
 205.05.2 Trench Excavation; Rock and Trench Rock Excavation - Mechanical. The
 accepted quantities of "Trench Excavation; Rock" or "Trench Rock Excavation - Mechanical" will
 be paid for at their respective contract unit prices per cubic yard as listed in the Proposal. The
 prices so-stated constitute full and complete compensation for all labor, materials, and
 2-35
 
 equipment, dewatering, and all other incidentals required to finish the work, complete and
 accepted by the Engineer.
 205.05.3 Backfilling of Trenches. The cost of placing and compacting backfill in trenches is
 not included in any of the classifications of Trench Excavation. These costs shall be included in
 the respective contract unit prices listed in the Proposal for the various classifications of pipe and
 drainage/utility structures. Excavated material which the Engineer determines to be unsuitable
 or not appropriate for backfilling around or above utilities shall be either removed to stockpile at
 the direction of the Engineer, or legally disposed of. Any additional borrow material required for

 operations. This will entail the constant monitoring of equipment, materials, and production
 activity to insure that bituminous mixtures meet all applicable requirements and are produced
 within the allowable tolerances. The Contractor shall be responsible for conducting any tests and
 making any analysis necessary to make certain that all mixtures are produced within the limits
 of the Specifications.
 The Contractor has the option of using the acceptance test results as part of its process
 control.
 b. Acceptance Testing. Acceptance testing will be conducted in the plant field laboratory
 by the Engineer.
 The results of an acceptance test are satisfactory only when all specification requirements
 are met. Neither the asphalt content nor the percent passing any sieve may vary from the mix
 design by more than the specified job mix tolerance. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of
 any unsatisfactory acceptance test result. Another acceptance test will be performed as soon as
 it is possible to sample mix produced after the Contractor has been given sufficient time to take
 corrective action. In no case will this be longer than the maximum prescribed acceptance testing
 interval.
 The Contractor shall cease production and delivery of any class of mix for the following
 reasons:
 1. The asphalt content or the percent passing any individual sieve varies from the mix
 design by more than twice the specified job mix tolerance in any single acceptance test.
 2. Either the asphalt content or the aggregate gradation exceeds the job mix tolerance
 on both of two consecutive acceptance tests on the same class of mix.
 3. The results of three acceptance tests within a 24-hour period on the same class of mix
 are unsatisfactory for any reason or combination of reasons.
 4-3
 
 4. Production of that class of mix will be allowed to resume on that day or on any
 succeeding day only after completion of a successful trial batch and it has been demonstrated
 to the satisfaction of the Engineer that material can be produced consistently and within
 specification.
 Failure to meet requirements will be cause for rejection by the Engineer of the nonconforming material produced.

 no case shall such rollers be operated at speeds in excess of five miles per hour.
 Vibratory rollers shall have separate controls for energy and propulsion and shall be
 acceptable for bituminous mixture compaction.
 One roller used for compaction shall be equipped with an infrared thermometer with
 remote sensor that will continuously indicate the temperature of the pavement and be visible to
 the operator during the rolling process.
 401.03.5 Conditioning of Existing Surfaces. Surfaces of curbs, gutters, vertical faces of
 existing pavements, and all structures to be in contact with the bituminous mixture shall be given
 a thin, even coating of bituminous material. Care shall be taken to avoid the splattering of
 surfaces which will not be in contact with the bituminous mixture.
 When a tack coat is required, the type and grade of bituminous material and the
 application methods shall conform to the applicable provisions of both SECTION M.03;
 MATERIALS and SECTION 403; ASPHALT EMULSION TACK COAT, of these Specifications.
 After a tack coat is applied, no bituminous mix shall be placed on it until the emulsion has
 broken. The tack coat shall be applied only as far in advance of the placing of mix as is
 necessary to obtain the proper condition of tackiness.
 401.03.6 Preparation of Bituminous Material. The bituminous material shall be heated to the
 specified temperature in a manner that will avoid local overheating and provide a continuous
 supply of the bituminous material to the mixer at a uniform temperature at all times.
 401.03.7 Preparation of Aggregates. The aggregates for the mixture shall be dried and heated
 to the required temperature. Flames used for drying and heating shall be properly adjusted to
 avoid damage to the aggregate and to avoid soot on the aggregate.
 In batch type plants, immediately after heating and drying, the aggregates shall be
 screened into two or more fractions as necessary and conveyed into separate compartments
 ready for batching and mixing with bituminous material.
 401.03.8 Mixing. The dried aggregates shall be combined in the mixer in the amount of each
 fraction of aggregates required to meet the job mix formula. The bituminous material shall be
 4-12
 
 measured or gauged and introduced into the mixer in the amount specified by the job mix
 formula.
 In batch type plants, the aggregates shall be mixed dry for a period of five (5) seconds;
 the asphalt cement shall then be added and mixing continued for a minimum total time of fortyfive (45) seconds or as directed or established by the Engineer.
 The temperature of the mixture shall be that established and approved by the job mix
 formula. The measurement of the mixing temperature shall be made as soon as possible after
 completion of the mixing cycle.
 401.03.9 Spreading and Finishing. The mixture shall be laid upon an approved cleaned
 surface, spread and struck off to the grade and elevation established. Bituminous pavers shall
 be used to distribute the mixture either over the entire width or over such partial width as may be
 practicable.
 The practices and guidelines for placing hot mix asphalt as outlined in Asphalt Institute
 Publication MS-22, “Construction of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements” shall be adhered to unless
 otherwise permitted by the Engineer.
 The maximum compacted lift thickness shall be 2 inches for surface courses and 3 inches
 for any other courses.
 Excessive and unnecessary walking on the uncompacted bituminous mat shall not be
 allowed.
 Before beginning a new lane, the screed shall be heated to the proper operating
 temperature and any clumps of cold material in the paver hopper shall be removed.
 No trucks or other equipment shall be allowed on freshly placed bituminous pavement
 unless specifically permitted by the Engineer.
 On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical
 spreading and finishing equipment impracticable, the mixture shall be placed as close to its final
 position as possible. It shall then be spread, raked, and luted by hand tools in a manner which
 will minimize segregation and result in the required compacted thickness.
 Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, any layer of bituminous pavement, i.e.,
 surface, binder, or base course, called for on side streets or driveways must be placed to a
 distance of at least three feet beyond the gutter line at the same time that layer is being placed
 on the adjacent project roadway. The practice of placing pavement on side streets after the main
 roadway has been paved results in cold joints at the gutter line and, therefore, such practice is
 not acceptable.
 a. Bituminous Overlay - Bridge Binder. When a bridge binder course is being placed
 on a surface which is covered with a waterproofing membrane, the following precautions should
 be observed:
 1. No traffic other than paving equipment should be allowed on the membrane.
 
 4-13
 
 2. The paver must be moved carefully on and off the membrane. Initial proper adjustment
 of the paver to the correct depth is very important to prevent tearing the membrane. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for making any repairs to the membrane or to the asphalt
 concrete overlay necessary to correct damage caused by the paving operation, all at its expense.
 3. Any and all tears of the membrane by the paver or trucks should be repaired
 immediately. Vehicle tires shall be clean of any rocks or materials that would puncture the
 membrane.
 4. The paving trucks are not to be pushed with the paver.
 5. Truck drivers shall not make quick stops and starts, nor turn the wheels while parked,
 nor cross the deck at an angle.
 401.03.10 Compaction. Immediately after the bituminous mixture has been spread, struck
 off, and surface irregularities adjusted, it shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted by
 rolling.
 The surface shall be rolled when the mixture is in the proper condition and when rolling
 does not cause undue displacement, cracking, and shoving.
 Two rollers shall be required for all paving operations that exceed a daily total of 500 tons,
 except in the case of driveway, sidewalk and bridge deck paving operations. The number, weight
 and type of roller(s) shall be sufficient to compact the mixture to the required density before it
 reaches the minimum compaction temperature. Vibratory rollers used for compaction shall be
 operated in the vibratory mode. All rollers used for compaction shall have a manufacturer’s rating
 of ten tons or greater. The use of equipment which results in excessive crushing of the aggregate
 will not be permitted.
 The sequence of rolling operations and the selection of roller types shall be such as to
 obtain the required density. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum acceptable density shall
 be 95 percent of the corresponding daily plant Marshall density (AASHTO T245).
 Density measurements shall be made with a nuclear density gauge. In the event of a
 dispute as to the credibility of the results, the density shall be determined from cores taken from
 the pavement.
 The rolling of a bridge binder course shall begin when the temperature of the mat is not
 more than 240OF. The ideal temperature for initial compaction of all other types of hot mix is
 275OF. Final compaction shall be completed before the temperature of the mat drops below
 175OF. The typical time that shall elapse between spreading and completion of the rolling
 process shall not normally exceed fifteen minutes. This time limit may be modified by the
 Engineer depending on temperature conditions, but under no circumstances will rolling be
 allowed when the temperature of the material is less than 175OF.
 The speed of a static weight, steel wheel roller, pneumatic tire roller, or vibratory roller
 shall not exceed five miles per hour.
 
 4-14
 
 Rollers shall not be temporarily parked on hot mix. When reversing direction, the action
 should be smooth, not abrupt. The drive wheel should approach the new mix, not the tiller wheel.
 When a vibratory roller is used for finish rolling, it shall be used in the static mode. Finish
 rolling shall continue until all roller marks are eliminated.
 Unless otherwise directed, rolling shall start longitudinally at the sides and gradually
 progress toward the center of the pavement, except on super-elevated curves where the rolling
 shall begin on the low side and progress to the high side, overlapping on successive trips by at
 least one-half the width of tandem rollers and uniformly lapping each preceding track.
 The motion of the rollers shall be slow enough at all times to avoid displacement of the
 hot mixture and any displacement resulting from reversing the direction of the rollers, or from any
 other cause, shall be satisfactorily corrected. The wheels of steel-wheel rollers shall be kept
 moist and clean to prevent adhesion of the fresh material, but an excess of water will not be
 permitted.
 If satisfactory density cannot be obtained in any lift, and if the Engineer determines it to
 be structurally inadequate and/or incapable of maintaining material integrity, the Contractor shall
 be required to remove and replace any such area at its own expense.
 Any mixture that becomes loose and broken, mixed with dirt, or is in any way defective
 shall be removed and replaced with fresh hot mixture, which shall then be compacted to conform
 with the surrounding area. Any area showing an excess or deficiency of bituminous material shall
 be removed and replaced.
 401.03.11 Joints. Placing of the bituminous paving shall be as continuous as possible. Rollers
 shall not pass over the unprotected end of a freshly laid mixture unless authorized by the
 Engineer.
 Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be made in a careful manner. Well bonded and
 sealed joints are required. Both longitudinal and transverse joints in successive courses shall be
 staggered so as not to be one above the other. Longitudinal joints shall be staggered a minimum
 of 6 inches and shall be arranged so that the longitudinal joint in the top course being constructed
 shall be at the location of the line dividing the traffic lanes. Joints between old and new
 pavements, or between successive days' work, shall be carefully made in such a manner as to
 insure a thorough and continuous bond between the old and new surfaces. The edge of the old
 pavement or previously placed new pavement, shall be cut back a sufficient distance to expose
 a fresh, full thickness, vertical face. To obtain a well bonded joint, this face shall be brush-painted
 or pressure sprayed with a bituminous tack coat, after which the hot bituminous mixture shall be
 placed in contact with it. Any bituminous material that falls on the cold side of the mat during
 paving operations shall be raked onto the hot joint. Care shall be taken to insure that the material
 pushed onto the hot side of the joint remains in the joint area and is not broadcast over the
 pavement. The edge of a newly placed pavement that has not been opened to traffic need not
 be cut back but will require tack coat.
 Immediately after compaction, the surface tolerance adjacent to each transverse cold joint
 shall be tested by placing an approved 10-foot straightedge perpendicular to the cold joint such
 that the midpoint of the straightedge rests on the cold joint. The variation of the surface from the
 4-15
 
 testing edge of the straightedge at any point between contacts with the surface shall not exceed
 1/4-inch.
 401.03.12 Pavement Samples. When specified, the Contractor shall cut samples from the
 compacted pavement for testing by the Engineer. Samples of the mixture shall be taken for the
 full depth of the course at the locations directed by the Engineer.
 Where samples have been taken, new material shall be placed and compacted to conform
 with the surrounding area.
 401.03.13 Surface Tolerances. The surface will be tested by the Engineer at selected
 locations, using an approved 10-foot straightedge furnished by the Contractor. The variation of
 the surface from the testing edge of the straightedge between any two contacts with the surface,
 shall at no point exceed 1/4-inch. All humps or depressions exceeding the specified tolerance
 shall be corrected by removing defective work and replacing it with new material as directed.
 401.03.14 Thickness Requirements. The thickness of a pavement shall be that as shown on
 the Plans and shall not vary from the specified thickness by more than that specified in
 Subsection 401.04, below, except as otherwise provided for in resurfacing existing pavements.
 401.03.15 Weather Limitations. Bituminous concrete shall not be placed on any wet surface,
 or when weather conditions otherwise prevent the proper handling or finishing of the bituminous
 mixtures.
 a. Restrictions. Bituminous concrete paving may not be placed under any of the
 following conditions:
 1. When the underlying layer contains frozen moisture.
 2. When the temperature of the underlying layer, in the shade and away from any source
 of heat, is below 32OF.
 3. When the temperature of the underlying layer, in the shade and away from any source
 of heat, is below 34OF and the thickness of the lift to be placed is 1½ inches, or less.
 b. Compaction. Rollers shall follow pavers as close as possible to provide the specified
 compaction. Should additional rollers be required, they will be provided in a timely manner.
 Specification density shall be achieved before the mix temperature drops below 175OF.
 401.03.16 Cold Weather Paving. If the existing pavement is removed before the winter
 shutdown, the Contractor shall not close the project for the season until a new bituminous binder
 course has been placed and striped with temporary pavement markings.
 401.03.17 Drop-Offs.
 a. Longitudinal Drop-Offs. A longitudinal drop-off occurs along the outside edges of
 pavement and is the difference in elevation between the top of recently placed bituminous
 pavement and the top of existing ground (or pavement).
 
 4-16
 
 1. For Posted Speeds of 35 mph or Less. Drop-offs greater than 3 inches but less
 than 5 inches shall be tapered to a maximum 1-to-1 slope to existing ground or pavement. Dropoffs 5 inches, or greater, shall be tapered to a maximum 4-to-1 horizontal to vertical slope to
 existing ground or pavement.
 2. For Posted Speeds Greater than 35 mph. Longitudinal drop-offs will not be
 permitted within 2 feet of a travel lane. The first 2 feet adjacent to a travel lane must be at grade
 with the travel lane. However, should either the sequence of operation required by the Contract
 or the Contractor’s approved sequence of operation result in overnight drop-offs greater than 3
 inches occurring between 2 and 6 feet from the edge of a travel lane, then such drop-offs shall
 be tapered to a 4-to-1 horizontal to vertical slope to existing ground or pavement.
 All tapers shall be constructed with hot mix asphalt conforming to the requirements of this
 SECTION 401 of these Specifications.
 Longitudinal drop-offs within the roadway cross section will not be allowed except as
 otherwise detailed on the Plans or as described in a Special Provision.
 Longitudinal drop-offs will not be paid for separately, but will be included in the contract
 unit price for bituminous pavements as listed in the Proposal.
 b. Transverse Drop-Offs. Transverse drop-offs occur as follows:
 Pavement removal. A transverse drop-off occurs when pavement removal operations
 cease at the end of a working day. The drop-off is the difference in elevation between the bottom
 of the excavated pavement and the top of the existing pavement.
 Pavement overlay. A transverse drop-off occurs when pavement overlay operations
 cease at the end of a working day. The drop-off is the difference in elevation between the top of
 the overlay pavement and the top of the existing pavement.
 In each case, at the end of a working day, either the pavement removal operations or the
 pavement overlay operation must be left in a “squared-off” condition, or approximately
 perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
 If traffic is allowed across either of these drop-offs during the period prior to the
 resumption of pavement removal or pavement overlay operations, tapers must be provided as
 follows:
 1. For Posted Speeds of 35 mph or Less. Transverse drop-offs in place at the end of
 a working day shall be graded at a slope of 5 feet horizontal to 1 inch vertical.
 2. For Posted Speeds Greater than 35 mph. Transverse drop-offs in place at the end
 of a working day shall be graded at a slope of 10 feet horizontal to 1 inch vertical.
 All slopes shall be constructed with hot mix asphalt conforming to the requirements of
 SECTION 401 of these Specifications.
 The Contractor shall place one W8-1 (30" x 30") “BUMP” sign at each drop-off for each
 direction of traffic.
 4-17
 
 Prior to the resumption of pavement overlay operations the transition slope shall be
 removed as follows: The pavement overlay shall be saw cut back approximately 6 inches to
 expose a fresh, full thickness vertical face. This face shall be brush-painted or pressure sprayed
 with bituminous tack coat, after which the bituminous paving may resume.
 Transverse drop-offs will not be paid for separately, but will be included in the contract unit
 prices for bituminous pavements as listed in the Proposal.
 401.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 401.04.1 Measurement of Bituminous Concrete Pavement. Bituminous Concrete Pavements,
 will be measured by the number of tons actually placed in accordance with the Plans and/or as
 directed by the Engineer. As an alternative, batch weights may be used for measurement so long
 as the automatic proportioning and recording equipment provisions of Subsection 401.03.1;
 Bituminous Mixing Plants, are satisfied. In such case the cumulative weight of all the batches
 will be used for payment.
 a. Determination of Thickness. The thickness of each course as well as of the total
 asphalt concrete pavement shall be that indicated on the Plans, or as ordered by the Engineer.
 Prior to the determination of thickness, the roadway shall exhibit acceptable workmanship
 and all defects shall have been corrected. The thickness of the total asphalt concrete pavement
 will be determined by cutting or coring holes to full depth. At least two cores will be taken from
 each lane mile, except that there will be a minimum of ten cores per project, all at the discretion
 of the Engineer. Cores will be measured in accordance with ASTM D3549; Standard Test
 Method for Thickness or Height of Compacted Bituminous Paving Mixture Specimens. The depth
 measurement will be considered as applying for the full width of the lane. Measurements will be
 made at random locations determined by the Engineer and all information relative thereto will be
 recorded in the project records.
 For the determination of thickness, a shoulder width of six feet or greater will be
 considered to be a separate lane of the roadway. A shoulder width of less than six feet will be
 considered part of the adjacent lane. The Contractor shall fill any holes cut or cored in the
 pavement by the Department with a compacted, dense bituminous hot mix material which is
 acceptable to the Engineer. If required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall maintain and control
 traffic while the pavement samples are being taken and while the holes are being filled and
 compacted. Payment will be made for the applicable traffic control item(s).
 b. Adjustment of Tonnage Quantity. The following definitions shall apply:
 1. Bituminous Base Course. Base course shall be as indicated on the Plans.
 2. Surface Course. The surface course shall consist of bituminous concrete constructed
 on a prepared base in accordance with these Specifications and in conformity with the lines,
 grades, thickness and typical cross sections shown on the Plans. For these measurements the
 binder course shall be considered part of the surface course.
 The pavement thickness will be considered acceptable if both of the following
 requirements are met:
 4-18
 
 (a) The total asphalt concrete tonnage delivered and placed does not exceed the tonnage
 calculated from the approved area measured from the final surface course width by the project
 length and the pavement thickness specified in the Contract Documents by more than 10 percent.
 and,
 (b) When Specification Conformity Analysis (Federal Highway Administration Technical
 Advisory T5080.12; dated June 23, 1989) is applied to the entire roadway or sections thereof as
 determined by the Engineer, at least 80 percent of the total asphalt concrete pavement will have
 a thickness that meets the minimum pavement thickness. The minimum pavement thickness is
 that contained in the contract documents minus ½-inch, (e.g., a total pavement thickness of 7
 inches will have a minimum pavement thickness requirement of 6.5 inches).
 If the first requirement is not met, no payment will be made for all tonnage exceeding 10
 percent, unless unusual field conditions are present and documented (e.g., pavement rutting).
 If the second requirement indicates that the pavement thickness is deficient, the
 Contractor with permission of the Engineer shall place a correction course not less than one inch
 in depth after compaction, provided an acceptable grade and cross section can be achieved.
 Where an acceptable grade and cross section cannot be achieved through the above means, the
 Contractor shall reconstruct by cutting back and into the pavement a sufficient distance to permit
 the placement of an acceptable depth and place new material to achieve the proper depth, cross
 section and profile. These areas where a corrective course is placed or reconstruction of the
 pavement is performed, will be measured again as though originally constructed; no compensation will be made to the Contractor for the material removed or removal of materials and disposal
 thereof or for restoration of affected supporting base or adjacent construction, or for traffic control,
 adjusting all utility appurtenances in the roadway or for correcting pavement striping. Compensation will be made for the additional pavement (Class I-1) correction course accepted in place.
 Determination of the quantity to be used for adjusted payment or exclusion for payment
 will be based on tons per square yard per inch thickness as determined by Marshall core
 (AASHTO T245) densities using the accepted job mix formula.
 Sweeping and cleaning, as included in the items covered by this section, refers to the
 normal removal of dust, debris, etc. only. Any sweeping and cleaning necessary due to
 construction being held over for the winter season, in accordance with the approved construction
 schedule, will be paid for separately.
 Work described in Subsection 401.03.5; Conditioning of Existing Surface, will be paid
 for at the contract unit prices for the material used.
 401.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantities of the various types of "Bituminous
 Pavements" i.e., Base Courses, Binder Courses, and Surface Courses, will be paid for at their
 respective contract unit prices per ton as listed in the Proposal. The prices so-stated constitute
 full and complete compensation for all labor, materials and equipment, and for all other
 incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted by the Engineer.

 To provide adequate stripping resistance, the asphalt cement shall be blended with an
 approved anti-stripping compound (100 percent active). The dosage level shall be as
 recommended by the manufacturer. The anti-stripping compound shall be heat stable and
 capable of remaining in storage indefinitely.
 402.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 402.03.1 General Requirements. The mixing, placing and finishing of bituminous friction course
 shall conform to the applicable requirements of Subsection 401.03 of these Specifications,
 together with the following exceptions and additional conditions:
 a. Both the mixing temperature and the temperature of the friction courses at the time of
 placement shall be within the range of 240OF to 280OF.
 b. The plant shall operate solely for the production of this mixture and exclusively for the
 State of Rhode Island. The unloading of silos must commence within one hour from the time
 loading begins, and silos must be completely emptied within one hour from the time they are
 filled. The use of silos for storage will not be permitted.
 4-21
 
 c. The mixture shall be compacted to the required density with adequately ballasted static
 steel wheel rollers. Adequately ballasted vibratory rollers may be allowed provided they are used
 in the static mode.
 d. The mixture shall be placed as soon as possible after completion of mixing at the plant.
 It shall be placed within 90 minutes from the time it is loaded in the truck, subject to the specified
 placement temperature range.
 402.03.2 Production and Placement. When placed on a newly reconstructed surface, the
 thickness shall be as shown on the Plans with a tolerance of ±¼ inch. When used to overlay an
 existing roadway, the thickness shall be minimum of 1 inch and a maximum of 1¾ inches to
 accommodate for rut depths of up to ¾ inch on the existing pavement.
 The surface on which the friction course is to be placed shall be treated with a tack coat.
 Tack coat must be applied uniformly over the surface of the underlying pavement. It may be
 diluted up to 50 percent with water during the manufacturing process. The surface shall be
 broom cleaned before the application of tack coat. The application rate shall be 0.03 ±.01 gallons
 per square yard.
 Spreading of the mixture shall be performed carefully and the operation shall be as
 continuous as possible. Particular attention shall be given to the joints and any irregularities shall
 be removed before compacting.
 After placement, the mixture shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted with power
 rollers as directed by the Engineer. Sufficient rollers shall be furnished to handle the output of
 the plant. Rolling shall continue until all roller marks are eliminated, the surface is of uniform
 texture and true to grade and cross section.
 When friction course is placed, compaction with a static steel wheel roller shall be
 accomplished immediately after lay down when the temperature of the layer is 240OF ±20OF.
 Over-rolling or rolling when the material is too cool should be avoided so as not to crush the
 aggregate. In-place density shall be a minimum of 96 percent of Marshall density as determined
 at the plant. Density shall be attained before the temperature of the surface falls below 175OF.
 Excess concentrations of asphalt can be easily detected during paving operations. All
 "fat" areas shall be removed immediately. The wasted quantity, as determined by the Engineer,
 shall be subtracted from the quantity shipped that day.
 402.03.3 Weather Limitations. Friction course shall not be placed on a wet or damp surface
 or when the temperature of the surface course, in the shade, is less than 40OF, measured prior
 to placement. It shall only be placed when the air temperature, in the shade, is at least 40OF and
 rising.
 402.03.4 Time Limitation. Friction course shall only be placed between the period of June 1st
 to August 31st.
 
 4-22
 
 402.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 402.04.1 Dense Friction Course. "Dense Friction Course" will be measured by the number of
 tons actually placed in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.

 tons actually placed in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 402.04.3 Ten Percent Limitation. Pavement thickness will be considered acceptable when
 placed within the tolerances specified. The total tonnage delivered and placed shall not exceed
 the tonnage calculated from the approved areas measured from the final surface course width,
 by the project length, and the pavement thickness in the Contract, by more than 10 percent.
 A thicker pavement may be acceptable; however, no payment shall be made for any
 quantity of asphalt concrete delivered which exceeds 110 percent of the final measured length,
 times measured width, times specified thickness, times unit weight.
 402.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantities of "Dense Friction Course" and "Ramp
 Friction Course" will be paid for at their respective contract unit prices per ton as listed in the
 Proposal. The prices so-stated constitute full and complete compensation for all labor, materials
 and equipment and all other incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted by the
 Engineer.
 SECTION 403

 403.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of furnishing, delivering, and placing a liquid asphalt
 tack coat on bituminous concrete or Portland cement concrete, prior to the placement of a
 bituminous concrete overlay, all in accordance with these Specifications.
 403.02 MATERIALS. The asphalt emulsion shall be SS-1, SS-1h, CSS-1, or CSS-1h.
 403.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 403.03.1 Equipment. Application of the asphalt emulsion tack coat shall be by means of a
 pressure distributor capable of producing a uniform continuous fine spray, through multiple
 nozzles, resulting in a uniform continuous coat of asphalt emulsion over the section to be treated.
 Any puddles of tack coat must be squeegeed or broomed out.
 403.03.2 Application of Bituminous Material.
 a. Application Rates. The asphalt emulsion shall be applied at the following rates over
 the entire area to be overlayed:
 
 4-23
 
 1. Old Pavement. The application rate shall be 0.08 gallons per square yard, plus-orminus 0.02 gallons per square yard.
 2. New Pavement.
 (a) Thirty days old or has been opened to traffic: The application rate shall be 0.06
 gallons per square yard, plus-or-minus 0.02 gallons per square yard.
 (b) Less than thirty days old and has not yet been opened to traffic: Tack coat is not
 required.
 b. Nozzle Settings. Tack coat shall be applied using the proper nozzle settings and the
 “double coverage” or “triple coverage” techniques as outlined in Chapter 5 of Asphalt Institute
 Publication MS-22, “Construction of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements.”
 c. Additional Requirements. Special care shall be taken at gore areas to insure that
 asphalt emulsion is not sprayed or tracked onto precast reflectorized gore markers. This shall
 be accomplished by placing a covering over the gore markers, anchored in place prevent any
 displacement.
 403.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Asphalt Emulsion Tack Coat" will be measured by the
 number of square yards actually spread in the designated area(s) and at the specified rate, all
 in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 403.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantity of "Asphalt Emulsion Tack Coat" will be
 paid for at the contract unit price per square yard as listed in the Proposal. The price so-stated
 constitutes full and complete compensation for all labor, materials, and equipment, and all other
 incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted by the Engineer.
 SECTION 404
 PRIME COAT

 JOINTS IN BITUMINOUS CONCRETE PAVEMENTS OVER RIGID BASE
 409.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of making a saw cut transversely across the finished
 bituminous surface pavement and filling it with a hot poured asphalt rubber compound at the
 locations indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer, all in accordance with these
 Specifications.
 409.02 MATERIALS. Poured joint seal material shall be an asphalt rubber compound of the hot
 poured type conforming to AASHTO M173 and approved by the Engineer.
 409.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 409.03.1 Equipment. The equipment to be used shall conform to the applicable requirements
 of Subsection 408.03.1, with the following exceptions:
 a. Router. A router will not be required.
 b. Power Saw and Blades. Saw and blades of such size and configuration that saw cuts
 can be made with one pass, and shall not cause damage or ravelling to the adjacent pavement
 sidewalls.
 409.03.2 Operation.
 a. General. The cut shall be made directly over the existing underpavement's transverse
 joints. The existing joints shall be located and marked so as to insure that the saw cuts are made
 directly over them.
 b. Sawing Joints. The joints shall be constructed no sooner than 30 days after the
 surface course has been applied.
 4-37
 
 The saw cutting of the joints shall be made with an approved power driven saw. The cuts
 shall be 3/8-inch wide by 3/4-inch deep. The saw cuts shall be made with an abrasive blade and
 sawn dry.
 The completed cuts shall extend in a straight line transversely across the pavement to the
 extent of the existing underpavement's transverse joints. Each joint to be sawed will be referenced by the Contractor. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to insure that the saw cuts
 are constructed directly over the existing underpavement's transverse joints.
 c. Cleaning and Sealing Joints. A sawed joint shall be air cleaned and sealed
 immediately after the saw cut has been made. Traffic shall not be allowed to knead together or
 damage the sawed joint. Each joint shall be thoroughly cleaned and dried prior to placement of
 the sealing compound. Any cleaning required shall be performed by blowing out all dirt, dust or
 deleterious matter that may have accumulated in the newly sawed joint. Sufficient air pressure
 shall be provided to insure thorough cleaning.
 The melter shall be either oil or gas-fired, and shall be of the double walled, oil bath type
 with a power driven mechanical agitator and circulation pump. The melter shall be equipped with
 a thermostat to maintain the sealing compound within the range of temperatures specified by the
 manufacturer and with a suitably mounted thermometer to indicate the temperature of the sealing
 compound in the melter. The melting temperature of the sealer will be furnished by the
 manufacturer, and shall not be exceeded by more than 10OF.
 The joint seal shall be applied with a pressurized mobile carriage and rubber shoe and the
 system shall have a flow control valve which allows all cracks to be filled to refusal so as to
 eliminate all voids or entrapped air and so as to not leave unnecessary surplus crack sealer on
 the pavement surface. The hot seal shall completely fill the joint, such that, after cooling, the
 level of the sealer will be flush with the pavement surface. Any depression in the seal shall be
 brought up to the specified limit by the further addition of hot seal. Care shall be taken in the
 sealing of the joints such that the final appearance will present a neat fine line. Overfilling of the
 joints will not be allowed, and spillage of the sealer should be avoided. All workmanship shall be
 of the highest quality, and all excess or spilled sealer must be removed from the pavement by
 approved methods and discarded.
 409.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Sawing and Sealing Transverse Joints in Bituminous
 Concrete Pavement" will be measured by the number of linear feet of sealed joint actually
 installed in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 409.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantity of "Sawing and Sealing Transverse Joints
 in Bituminous Concrete Pavement" will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot as
 listed in the Proposal. The price so-stated constitutes full and complete compensation for all
 labor, materials and equipment, and for all other incidentals required to finish the work, complete
 and accepted by the Engineer.

 PART 500
 CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
 SECTION 501
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT AND BASE
 501.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of constructing Portland cement concrete base or
 pavement, with or without reinforcement, on a prepared subgrade or subbase in reasonably close
 conformity with the dimensions and details indicated on the Plans, all in accordance with these
 Specifications.
 501.02 MATERIALS. Materials shall meet the requirements of SECTION M.02; PORTLAND
 CEMENT CONCRETE and SECTION M.05; METALS, of these Specifications.
 501.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 501.03.1 Construction Requirements. The classifications, proportioning, testing, batching,
 mixing, handling, placing, finishing and curing of Portland cement concrete pavement or base
 shall conform to the applicable requirements of SECTION 601; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE, of these Specifications.
 501.03.2 Equipment.
 a. Finishing Machines. Equipment for finishing concrete pavement shall be mechanical,
 self-propelled, spreading and finishing machines capable of consolidating the concrete and
 producing a finished surface as specified herein. Finishing machines shall be equipped with at
 least two oscillating type transverse screeds which shall be adjustable to produce a crowned or
 flat surface as required.
 b. Vibrators. Vibrators, for full width vibration of concrete paving, may be either the
 surface pan type or the internal types with either immersed tube or multiple spuds. They may be
 attached to the spreader or the finishing machine, or may be mounted on a separate carriage to
 accommodate either slip form or side form paving methods. They shall not come in contact with
 the joint, load transfer devices, subgrade, reinforcing, or side forms. The frequency of the surface
 vibrators shall not be less than 3,500 impulses per minute and the frequency of the internal type
 shall not be less than 5,000 impulses per minute for tube vibrators and not less than 7,000
 impulses per minute for spud vibrators.
 Vibrators shall be rubber tipped to prevent damage to epoxy-coated reinforcing steel.
 c. Concrete Saw. When sawing joints is elected or specified, the Contractor shall
 provide sawing equipment adequate in number of units and power to complete the sawing with
 a water-cooled diamond edge saw blade or an abrasive wheel to the required dimensions and
 at the required rate. The Contractor shall provide at least one standby saw in good working order.
 5-1
 
 An ample supply of saw blades shall be maintained at the site of the work at all times during
 sawing operations. The Contractor shall provide adequate artificial lighting facilities for night
 sawing.
 d. Forms. Straight side forms shall be made of a metal having a thickness of not less
 than 7/32-inch and shall be furnished in sections not less than 10 feet in length. Forms shall have
 a depth equal to or greater than the prescribed edge thickness of the concrete, without horizontal
 joint, and a base width equal to or greater than the depth of the forms. Flexible or curved forms
 of proper radius shall be used for curves of 100-foot radius or less. Flexible or curved forms shall
 be of a design acceptable to the Engineer. Forms shall be provided with adequate devices for
 secure setting so that when in place they will withstand, without visible spring or settlement, the
 impact and vibration of the consolidating and finishing equipment. Flange braces shall extend
 outward on the base not less than two-thirds the height of the form. Forms with battered top
 surfaces, and bent, twisted, or broken forms shall be removed from the work. Repaired forms
 shall not be used until inspected and approved by the Engineer. Built-up forms shall not be used
 except where the total area of pavement of any specified thickness on the project is less than
 2,000 square yards. The top face of the form shall not vary from a true plane more than 1/8-inch
 in 10 feet, and the upstanding leg shall not vary more than 1/4-inch. The forms shall contain
 provisions for locking the ends of abutting form sections together tightly, and for secure setting.
 501.03.3 Preparation of Grade. After the roadbed has been graded and compacted to meet
 the density requirements of Subsection 301.03.2 of these Specifications, the grade shall be
 trimmed approximately to correct elevation, extending the work at least 2 feet beyond each edge
 of the proposed concrete pavement or base.
 501.03.4 Setting Support.
 a. Base Support. The foundation under the forms shall be hard and true to grade so that
 the form, when set, will be firmly in contact for its whole length and at the specified grade.
 b. Form Setting. Forms shall be set sufficiently in advance of the point where concrete
 is being placed. Forms shall be staked into place with not less than 3 pins for each 10-foot
 section. A pin shall be placed at each side of every joint. Form sections shall be tightly
 interlocked, free from play or movement in any direction. The forms shall not deviate from true
 line by more than 1/4-inch at any point. No excessive settlement or springing of forms under the
 finishing machine will be tolerated. Forms shall be cleaned and oiled prior to the placing of
 concrete.
 c. Grade and Alignment. The alignment and grade elevations of the forms shall be
 checked and corrections made by the Contractor before placing the concrete. When any form
 has been disturbed or any grade has become unstable, the form shall be reset and rechecked.
 501.03.5 Conditioning of Subgrade or Base Course. When side forms have been securely
 set to grade, the subgrade or base course shall be brought to proper cross section. High areas
 shall be trimmed to proper elevation. Low areas may be filled and compacted to a condition
 similar to that of surrounding grade, or filled with concrete integral with the pavement. The
 finished grade shall be maintained in a smooth and compacted condition until the pavement is
 placed.
 
 5-2
 
 Unless waterproof subgrade or base course cover material is specified, the subgrade or
 base course shall be uniformly moist when the concrete is placed. If it subsequently becomes
 too dry, the subgrade or base course shall be sprinkled, but the method of sprinkling shall not be
 such as to form mud or pools of water.
 501.03.6 Placing Concrete. Concrete shall not be placed on soft, muddy, or frozen subgrade
 or subbase. Also, concrete shall not be placed when subgrade is frozen under adjacent
 pavement which is to remain in place.
 The concrete shall be deposited on the grade in such manner as to require as little
 rehandling as possible. Unless truck mixers, truck agitators, or nonagitating hauling equipment
 are equipped with means for discharge of concrete without segregation of the materials, the
 concrete shall be unloaded into an approved spreading device and mechanically spread on the
 grade in such manner to prevent segregation of the materials. Placing shall be continuous
 between transverse joints without the use of intermediate bulkheads. Necessary hand spreading
 shall be done with shovels, not rakes. Workmen shall not be allowed to walk in the freshly mixed
 concrete with boots or shoes coated with earth or foreign substances.
 Where concrete is to be placed adjoining a previously constructed lane of pavement and
 mechanical equipment will be operated upon the existing lane of pavement, that pavement shall
 meet the minimum flexural strength of 525 pounds per square inch when tested by the third-point
 method in accordance with AASHTO T97. If only finishing equipment is carried on the existing
 lane, paving in adjoining lanes may be permitted after three days.
 Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated against and along the faces of all forms and
 along the full length and on both sides of all joint assemblies, by means of internal vibrators
 inserted in the concrete. Vibrators shall not be permitted to come in contact with a joint assembly,
 the grade, reinforcement, or a side form. In no case shall the vibrator be operated longer than
 10 seconds in any one location. The vibration shall be of sufficient duration to thoroughly
 consolidate the concrete but not so long as to produce segregation.
 Concrete shall be deposited as near to expansion and contraction joints as possible
 without disturbing them, but shall not be dumped from the discharge bucket or hopper onto a joint
 assembly unless the hopper is well centered on the joint assembly.
 Should any concrete materials fall on or be worked into the surface of a completed slab,
 they shall be removed immediately by approved methods.
 501.03.7 Test Specimens. The Contractor shall furnish the concrete necessary for casting test
 beams and cylinders. The beams shall be cured by a designated method as specified for the
 pavement according to AASHTO T23.
 501.03.8 Strike-off of Concrete and Placement of Reinforcement. Following the placing of
 the concrete, it shall be struck off to conform to the cross section shown on the Plans and to an
 elevation such that when the concrete is properly consolidated and finished, the surface of the
 pavement will be at the elevation shown on the Plans. When reinforced concrete pavement is
 placed in two layers, the entire width of the bottom layer shall be struck off to such length and
 depth that the sheet of fabric or bar mat may be laid full length on the concrete in its final position
 without further manipulation. The reinforcement shall then be placed directly upon the concrete,
 after which the top layer of the concrete shall be placed, struck off and screeded. Any portion of
 the bottom layer of concrete which has been placed more than 30 minutes without being covered
 5-3
 
 with the top layer shall be removed and replaced with freshly mixed concrete at the Contractor's
 expense. When reinforced concrete is placed in one layer, the reinforcement may be positioned
 in advance of concrete placement or it may be placed in plastic concrete, after spreading by
 mechanical or vibratory means. The surface of reinforcing steel shall be free from any material
 which could impair bond of the steel with the concrete, all in accordance with the applicable
 requirements of SECTION 808; CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY, of
 these Specifications.
 501.03.9 Joints. Joints shall be constructed of the type and dimensions, and at the locations
 required by the Plans or Special Provisions.
 a. Longitudinal Joint. Longitudinal sawed joints shall be cut by means of approved
 concrete saws to the depth, width and line shown on the Plans. Suitable guide lines or devices
 shall be used to assure cutting the longitudinal joint on the true line as shown on the Plans. The
 longitudinal joint shall be sawed before the end of the curing period and before any equipment
 or vehicles are allowed on the pavement. The sawed area shall be thoroughly cleaned and, if
 required, the joint shall immediately be filled with sealer.
 b. Transverse Expansion Joints. The expansion joint filler shall be continuous from
 form to form, shaped to the subgrade and to the keyway along the form. Preformed joint filler
 shall be furnished in lengths equal to the pavement width or equal to the width of one lane.
 Damaged or repaired joint filler shall not be used unless approved by the Engineer.
 The expansion joint filler shall be held in a vertical position. An approved installing bar,
 or other device, shall be used if required to secure preformed expansion joint filler at the proper
 grade and alignment during placing and finishing of the concrete. Finished joints shall not deviate
 more than 1/4-inch in the horizontal alignment from a straight line. If joint fillers are assembled
 in sections, there shall be no offsets between adjacent units. No plugs of concrete shall be
 permitted anywhere within the expansion space.
 c. Transverse Contraction Joints. Transverse contraction joints shall consist of planes
 of weakness created by cutting grooves in the surface of the pavement and, when shown on the
 Plans, shall include load transfer assemblies.
 1. Sawed Contraction Joints shall be created by sawing grooves in the surfaces of the
 pavement or base to the dimensions and at the spacing and lines shown on the Plans with an
 approved concrete saw. After each joint is sawed, the saw cut and adjacent concrete surface
 shall be thoroughly cleaned.
 If curing blankets are used they shall be removed from the pavement only at the
 location(s) where a joint is to be sawed and only a sufficient width to allow the cut to be made.
 As soon as the cut has been made curing material shall be replaced. In no case shall either the
 top or edges of concrete be left unprotected for more than one-half hour.
 Sawing of the joints shall commence as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently
 to permit sawing without excessive raveling, usually 4 to 24 hours. All joints shall be sawed
 before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking takes place. If necessary, the sawing operations shall be
 carried on during the day and night, regardless of weather conditions. The sawing of any joint
 shall be omitted if a crack occurs at or near the joint location prior to the time of sawing. Sawing
 shall be discontinued when a crack develops ahead of the saw. The pavement within the lane
 where cracks occur shall be removed to the full width of the lane and replaced. The minimum
 5-4
 
 lane length of pavement replacement shall be 6 feet. If cracking occurs on both sides of the
 same joint, the dowel assembly and a minimum of 3 feet on each side of the joint shall be
 removed and replaced, all at the Contractor's expense.
 In general, all joints should be sawed in sequence. All contraction joints in lanes adjacent
 to previously constructed lanes shall be sawed before uncontrolled cracking occurs. If extreme
 conditions exist which make it impractical to prevent erratic cracking by early sawing, the
 contraction joint groove shall be formed prior to initial set of concrete.
 2. Transverse Construction Joints shall be constructed when there is an interruption
 of more than 30 minutes in the concreting operations. No transverse joint shall be constructed
 within 10 feet of an expansion joint, contraction joint, or plane of weakness. If sufficient concrete
 has not been mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at least 10 feet long, the excess
 concrete back to the last preceding joint shall be removed and disposed of.
 3. Load Transfer Devices. Dowels, when used, shall be held in position parallel to the
 surface and centerline of the slab by a metal device that is left in the pavement.
 The dowels shall be thoroughly coated with an approved lubricant to prevent the concrete
 from binding to that portion of the dowel. An approved metal dowel cap or sleeve shall be
 furnished for each dowel bar used with the expansion joints. The caps or sleeves shall fit the
 dowel bar tightly and the closed end shall be watertight.
 In lieu of using dowel assemblies at contraction joints, dowel bars may be placed in the
 full thickness of pavement by a mechanical device approved by the Engineer.
 501.03.10 Final Strike-off, Consolidation and Finishing of Concrete Pavement.
 a. Sequence. The sequence of operations shall be the strike-off and consolidation;
 machine finishing; floating; straightedging; and texturing.
 Following the placement of concrete, it shall be struck off to conform to the cross section
 indicated on the Plans and to an elevation such that once the concrete is properly consolidated
 and finished, the surface of the pavement will be at the elevation indicated on the Plans.
 In general, the addition of surficial water to the surface of the concrete to assist in finishing
 operations will not be permitted. If the application of water to the surface is permitted, it shall be
 applied as a fog spray by means of approved spray equipment.
 b. Finishing at Joints. The concrete adjacent to joints shall be compacted or firmly
 placed without voids or segregation against the joint material, also under and around all load
 transfer devices, joint assembly units, and other features designed to extend into the pavement.
 Concrete adjacent to joints shall be mechanically vibrated as required in Subsection 501.03.6.
 After the concrete has been placed and vibrated adjacent to the joints as required in
 Subsection 501.03.6, the finishing machine shall be brought forward, operating in a manner to
 avoid damage or misalignment of joints. If uninterrupted operation of the finishing machine, to,
 over, and beyond the joints causes segregation of concrete, damage to, or misalignment of the
 joints, the finishing machine shall be stopped when the front screed is approximately 8 inches
 from the joint. Segregated concrete shall be removed from in front of and off the joint; the front
 5-5
 
 screed shall be lifted and set directly on top of the joint and the forward motion of the finishing
 machine resumed. When the second screed is close enough to permit the excess mortar in front
 of it to flow over the joint, it shall be lifted and carried over the joint. Thereafter, the finishing
 machine may be run over the joint without lifting the screeds, provided there is no segregated
 concrete immediately between the joint and the screed or on top of the joint.
 c. Machine Finishing.
 1. Nonvibratory Method. The concrete shall be distributed or spread as soon as placed.
 As soon as the concrete has been placed, it shall be struck off and screeded by an approved
 finishing machine. The machine shall go over each area of pavement as many times and at such
 intervals as necessary to give the proper compaction and to leave a surface of uniform texture.
 Excessive operation over a given area shall be avoided. The tops of the forms shall be kept
 clean by an effective device attached to the machine and the travel of the machine on the forms
 shall be maintained true without lift, wobbling, or other variation tending to affect the precision
 finish.
 During the first pass of the finishing machine, a uniform ridge of concrete shall be
 maintained ahead of the front screed for its entire length.
 2. Vibratory Method. When vibration is specified, vibrators for full width vibration of
 concrete paving slabs shall meet the requirements in Subsection 501.03.2, Para. b. If uniform
 and satisfactory density of the concrete is not obtained by the vibratory method at joints, along
 forms, at structures, and throughout the pavement, the Contractor will be required to furnish
 equipment and methods which will produce pavement conforming to the Specifications. All the
 provisions in Para. c.1, above, not in conflict with the provisions for the vibratory method shall
 govern.
 d. Hand Finishing. Unless otherwise specified, hand finishing methods will not be
 permitted except under the following conditions:
 In the event of breakdown of the mechanical equipment, hand methods may be used to
 finish the concrete already deposited on the grade when the breakdown occurs.
 Narrow widths or areas of irregular dimensions where operations of the mechanical
 equipment is impractical may be finished by hand methods.
 Concrete, as soon as placed, shall be struck off and screeded. An approved portable
 screed shall be used. A second screed shall be provided for striking off the bottom layer of
 concrete, if reinforcement is used.
 The screed for the surface shall be at least 2 feet longer than the maximum width of the
 slab to be struck off. It shall be of approved design, sufficiently rigid to retain its shape, and be
 constructed either of metal or of other suitable material shod with metal.
 Consolidation shall be attained by the use of a suitable vibrator or other approved
 equipment. If necessary, this shall be repeated until the surface is of uniform texture, true to
 grade and cross section, and free from porous areas.
 
 5-6
 
 e. Floating. After the concrete has been struck off and consolidated, it shall be further
 smoothed, trued, and consolidated by means of a longitudinal float, using one of the following
 methods as specified or permitted:
 1. Hand Method. The hand-operated longitudinal float shall be not less than 12 feet in
 length and 6 inches in width, properly stiffened to prevent flexibility and warping. The longitudinal
 float, operated from foot bridges resting on the side forms and spanning but not touching the
 concrete, shall be worked with a sawing motion, while held in a floating position parallel to the
 road centerline, and passing gradually from one side of the pavement to the other. Movement
 ahead along the centerline of the pavement shall be in successive advances of not more than
 one-half the length of the float. Any excess water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side
 forms on each pass.
 2. Mechanical Method. The mechanical longitudinal float shall be of a design approved
 by the Engineer, and shall be in good working condition. The tracks from which the float operates
 shall be accurately adjusted to the required crown. The float shall be accurately adjusted and
 coordinated with the adjustments of the transverse finishing machine so that a small amount of
 mortar is carried ahead of the float at all times. The forward speed shall be adjusted so that the
 float will lap the distance specified by the Engineer on each transverse trip. The float shall pass
 over each area of pavement at least two times, but excessive operation over a given area will not
 be permitted. Any excess water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side forms on each
 pass.
 3. Alternative Mechanical Method. As an alternative to the Mechanical Method
 described above, the Contractor may use a machine composed of a cutting and smoothing float,
 or floats, suspended from and guided by a rigid frame. The frame shall be carried by four or more
 visible wheels riding on, and constantly in contact with, the side forms.
 If necessary, following one of the preceding methods of floating, long-handled floats
 having blades not less than 5 feet in length and 6 inches in width may be used to smooth and fill
 in open textured areas in the pavement. Long-handled floats shall not be used to float the entire
 surface of the pavement in lieu of, or supplementing, one of the preceding methods of floating.
 When strike-off and consolidation are done by the hand methods and the crown of the pavement
 will not permit the use of the longitudinal float, the surface shall be floated transversely by means
 of the long-handled float. Care shall be taken not to work the crown out of the pavement during
 the operation. After floating, any excess water and laitance shall be removed from the surface
 of the pavement by a straightedge 10 feet or more in length. Successive drags shall be lapped
 one-half the length of the blade.
 f. Straightedge Testing and Surface Correction. After the floating has been completed
 and the excess water removed, but while the concrete is still plastic, the surface of the concrete
 shall be tested for trueness with a 10-foot straightedge. For this purpose the Contractor shall
 furnish and use an accurate 10-foot straightedge swung from handles 3 feet longer than one-half
 the width of the slab. The straightedge shall be held in contact with the surface in successive
 positions parallel and perpendicular to the road centerline and the whole area gone over from
 one side of the slab to the other as necessary. Advance along the road shall be in successive
 stages of not more than one-half the length of the straightedge. Any depressions found shall be
 immediately filled with freshly mixed concrete, struck off, consolidated, and refinished. High
 areas shall be cut down and refinished. Special attention shall be given to assure that the surface
 across joints meets the requirements for smoothness. Straightedge testing and surface
 5-7
 
 corrections shall continue until the entire surface is found to be free from observable departures
 from the straightedge and the slab conforms to the required grade and cross section.
 g. Final Finish. The final finish shall be specified or shown on the Plans and shall
 consist of one of the three finishes described as follows:
 1. Broom Finish. If the surface texture is to be a broom finish, it shall be applied when
 the water sheen has practically disappeared. The broom shall be drawn from the center to the
 edge of the pavement with adjacent strokes slightly overlapping. The brooming operation shall
 be so executed that the corrugations produced in the surface shall be uniform in appearance and
 not more that 1/8-inch in depth. Brooming shall be completed before the concrete is in such
 condition that the surface will be torn or unduly roughened by the operation. The surface thus
 finished shall be free from rough and porous areas, irregularities, and depressions, resulting from
 improper handling of the broom. Brooms shall be of the quality, size, and construction and be
 so operated as to produce a surface finish meeting the approval of the Engineer. Subject to
 satisfactory results being obtained and approval of the Engineer, the Contractor will be permitted
 to substitute mechanical brooming in lieu of the manual brooming as herein described.
 2. Belt Finish. If the surface texture is to be a belt finish, when straightedging is
 complete and water sheen has practically disappeared and just before the concrete becomes
 nonplastic, the surface shall be belted with a 2-ply canvas belt not less than 8-inches wide and
 at least 3 feet longer than the pavement width. Hand belts shall have suitable handles to permit
 controlled, uniform manipulation. The belt shall be operated with short strokes transverse to the
 road centerline and with a rapid advance parallel to the centerline.
 3. Drag Finish. If the surface texture is to be a drag finish, a drag shall be used which
 shall consist of a seamless strip of damp burlap or cotton fabric, which shall produce a uniform
 surface of gritty texture after dragging it longitudinally along the full width of pavement. For
 pavement 16 feet or more in width, the drag shall be mounted on a bridge which travels on the
 forms. The dimensions of the drag shall be such that a strip of burlap or fabric at least 3 feet wide
 is in contact with the full width of pavement surface while the drag is used. The drag shall consist
 of not less than 2 layers of burlap with the bottom layer approximately 6 inches wider than the
 upper layer. The drag shall be maintained in such condition that the resultant surface is of
 uniform appearance and reasonably free from grooves over 1/8-inch in depth. Drags shall be
 maintained clean and free from encrusted mortar. Drags that cannot be cleaned shall be
 discarded and new drags substituted.
 h. Edging at Forms and Joints. After the final finish, but before the concrete has taken
 its initial set, the edges of the pavement along each side of each slab, and on each side of
 transverse expansion joints, formed joints, transverse construction joints, and emergency
 construction joints, shall be worked with an approved tool and rounded to the radius required by
 the Plans. A well-defined and continuous radius shall be produced and a smooth, dense mortar
 finish obtained. The surface of the slab shall not be unduly disturbed by tilting of the tool during
 use.
 At all joints, any tool marks appearing on the slab adjacent to the joints shall be eliminated
 by brooming the surface. In doing this, the rounding of the corner of the slab shall not be
 disturbed. All concrete on top of the joint filler shall be completely removed.
 
 5-8
 
 All joints shall be tested with a straightedge before the concrete has set, and corrections
 made if one side of the joint is higher than the other or if they are higher or lower than the
 adjacent slabs.
 i. Concrete Base. In the case of concrete base, the above requirements for finishing
 and/or longitudinal floating are waived.
 501.03.11 Surface Test.
 a. Concrete Pavement. As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently, the
 pavement surface shall be tested with an approved 10-foot straightedge furnished by the
 Contractor. Areas showing high spots of more than 1/4-inch but not exceeding 1/2-inch in ten
 feet shall be marked and immediately ground down with an approved grinding tool to an elevation
 where the area or spot will not show surface deviations in excess of 1/4-inch when tested with
 a 10-foot straightedge. Where the departure from correct cross section exceeds ½-inch, the
 pavement shall be removed and replaced by and at the expense of the Contractor.
 Any area or section so removed shall be not less than 10 feet in length nor less than the
 full width of the lane involved. When it is necessary to remove and replace a section of
 pavement, any remaining portion of the slab adjacent to the joints that is less than 10 feet in
 length, shall also be removed and replaced.
 b. Concrete Base. The surface of the concrete base shall be roughened by any means
 acceptable to the Engineer such as brooming, tinning, or burlap drag. The surface shall be
 finished so that there will be no deviation of more than 3/8-inch between any two contact points
 when tested with a 10-foot straightedge.
 501.03.12 Curing. Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and as soon
 as marring of the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be
 cured in accordance with the applicable provisions of Subsection 601.03.8 of these Specifications.
 501.03.13 Removing Forms. Unless otherwise provided, forms shall not be removed from
 freshly placed concrete until it has set for at least 12 hours, except auxiliary forms used
 temporarily in widened areas. Forms shall be removed carefully so as to avoid damage to the
 pavement. After the forms have been removed, the sides of the slab shall be cured as outlined
 in one of the methods indicated above. Major honeycombed areas will be considered as
 defective work and shall be removed and replaced. Any area or section so removed shall not be
 less than 10 feet in length nor less than full width of the lane involved. When it is necessary to
 remove and replace a section of pavement, any remaining portion of the slab adjacent to the
 joints that is less than 10 feet in length, shall also be removed and replaced.
 501.03.14 Sealing Joints. If the joints are to be sealed, they shall be filled with joint sealing
 material before the pavement is opened to traffic, and as soon after completion of the curing
 period as is feasible. Just prior to sealing, each joint shall be thoroughly cleaned of all foreign
 material, including membrane curing compound and the joint faces shall be cleaned and surface
 dry when the seal is applied. Material for seal applied hot shall be stirred during heating so that
 localized overheating does not occur.
 The sealing material shall be applied to each joint opening to conform to the details shown
 5-9
 
 on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. The pouring shall be done in such a manner that
 the material will not be spilled on the exposed surfaces of the concrete. Any excess material on
 the surface of the concrete pavement shall be removed immediately and the pavement surface
 cleaned. The use of sand or similar material as a cover for the seal will not be permitted. Poured
 joint-sealing material shall not be placed when the air temperature in the shade is less than 50OF,
 unless approved by the Engineer.
 When specified, preformed compression seals and lubricant adhesive shall conform to
 Subsection M.02.10.3 of these Specifications.
 501.03.15 Protection of Pavement. The Contractor shall protect the pavement and its
 appurtenances against both public traffic and traffic caused by his own employees and agents.
 Any damage to the pavement, occurring prior to final acceptance, shall be repaired or the
 pavement replaced.
 501.03.16 Opening to Traffic. The Engineer will decide when the pavement or base shall be
 opened to traffic. Pavement or base will not be opened to traffic until specimen beams have
 attained a flexural strength of 525 pounds per square inch when tested by the third-point method,
 in accordance with AASHTO T97.
 501.03.17 Concrete Pavement-Slip Form Method. If the Contractor elects to use the slip-form
 method, the following provisions shall apply:
 a. Grade. After the grade or base has been placed and compacted to the required
 density, the areas which will support the paving machine shall be cut to the proper elevation by
 means of a properly designed machine. The grade on which the pavement is to be constructed
 shall then be brought to the proper profile by means of a properly designed machine. If the
 density of the base is disturbed by the grading operations, it shall be corrected by additional
 compaction before concrete is placed. The grade should be constructed sufficiently in advance
 of the placing of the concrete. If any traffic is allowed to use the prepared grade, the grade shall
 be checked and corrected immediately ahead of the placing of the concrete.
 b. Placing Concrete. The concrete shall be placed with an approved slip-form paver
 designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float-finish the freshly placed concrete in such
 manner that a minimum of hand finish will be necessary to provide a dense and homogenous
 pavement in conformance with the Plans and Specifications. The machine shall vibrate the
 concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of pavement being placed. Such vibration shall
 be accomplished with vibrating tubes or arms working in the concrete. The sliding forms shall
 be rigidly held together laterally to prevent spreading of the forms. The forms shall trail behind
 the paver for such a distance that no appreciable slumping of the concrete will occur, and that
 necessary final finishing can be accomplished while the concrete is still within the forms.
 The concrete shall be held at a uniform consistency, having a slump of not more than 2
 inches. The slip-form paver shall be operated with as nearly a continuous forward movement as
 possible and all operations of mixing, delivering and spreading concrete shall be so coordinated
 as to provide uniform progress with stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum. If, for
 any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward movement of the paver, the vibratory and tamping
 elements shall also be stopped immediately. No tractive force shall be applied to the machine,
 except that which is controlled from the machine.
 5-10
 
 c. Finishing. The surface smoothness and texture shall meet the requirements of
 Subsection 501.03.10 and Subsection 501.03.11.
 d. Curing. Unless otherwise specified, curing shall be done in accordance with one of
 the methods included in Subsection 601.03.8. The curing media shall be applied at the
 appropriate time and shall be applied uniformly and completely to all surfaces and edges of the
 pavement.
 e. Joints. All joints shall be constructed in accordance with Subsection 501.03.9 and
 sealed in accordance with Subsection 501.03.14.
 f. Protection Against Rain. In order that the concrete may be properly protected against
 the effects of rain before the concrete is sufficiently hardened, the Contractor will be required to
 have available at all times materials for the protection of the edges and surface of the
 unhardened concrete. Such protective materials shall consist of standard metal forms or wood
 plank having a nominal thickness of not less than 2 inches and a nominal width of not less than
 the thickness of the pavement at its edge for the protection of the pavement edges, and covering
 material such as burlap or cotton mats, curing paper, or plastic sheeting material for the
 protection of the surface of the pavement. When rain appears imminent, all paving operations
 shall stop and all available personnel shall begin placing forms against the sides of the pavement
 and covering the surface of the unhardened concrete with the protective covering.
 501.03.18 Tolerance in Pavement or Base Thickness. The thickness of the pavement or base
 will be determined by the average caliper measurement of cores tested in accordance with
 AASHTO T148.
 For the purpose of establishing an adjusted unit price for the pavement or base, units to
 be considered separately are defined as 1,000 linear feet of pavement in each traffic lane starting
 at the end of the pavement bearing the smaller station number. The last unit in each lane shall
 be 1,000 feet plus the fractional part of 1,000 feet remaining. One core will be taken at random
 by the Department in each unit. When the measurement of the core from a unit is not deficient
 more than 3/8-inch from the Plan thickness, full payment will be made. When such measurement
 is deficient more than 3/8-inch and not more than 1 inch from the Plan thickness two additional
 cores at intervals of not less than 300 feet will be taken and used in the average thickness for that
 unit. An adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection 501.05.2 will be paid for the unit
 represented.
 Other areas such as intersections, entrances, crossovers, ramps, etc., will be considered
 as one unit and the thickness of each unit will be determined separately. Small irregular unit
 areas may be included as part of another unit. At such points as the Engineer may select in each
 unit, one core will be taken for each 1,000 square yards of base or pavement, or fraction thereof,
 in the unit. If the core so taken is not deficient more than 3/8-inch from the Plan thickness, full
 payment will be made. If the core is deficient in thickness by more than 3/8-inch but not more
 than 1 inch from the Plan thickness, two additional cores will be taken from the area represented
 and the average of the three cores determined. If the average measurement of these three cores
 is not deficient more than 3/8-inch from the Plan thickness, full payment will be made. If the
 average thickness of the three cores is deficient more than 3/8-inch but not more than 1 inch from
 the Plan thickness, an adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection 501.05.2 will be paid for the
 area represented by these cores.
 
 5-11
 
 In calculating the average thickness of the base, measurements which are in excess of
 the specified thickness by more than 3/8-inch will be considered as the specified thickness plus
 3/8-inch, and measurements which are less than the specified thickness by more than 1 inch will
 not be included in the average.
 When the measurement of any core is less than the Plan thickness by more than 1 inch,
 the actual thickness of the base in this area will be determined by taking additional cores at 10foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction from the affected location until in each
 direction a core is found which is not deficient by more than 1 inch. Areas found deficient in
 thickness by more than 1 inch shall be evaluated by the Engineer. If the Engineer decides that
 the deficient areas should be removed, they shall be removed and replaced with concrete of the
 thickness shown on the Plans. Exploratory cores for deficient thickness will not be used in
 averages for adjusted unit price.
 The method of establishing the adjusted unit price for pavement based on the
 measurement of cores is specified below in Subsection 501.05.2.
 501.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Portland Cement Concrete Pavement" and "Portland
 Cement Concrete Base" will be measured by the number of square yards of each actually
 provided in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 The width for measurement will be the width of the pavement shown on the typical cross
 section of the Plans, additional widening where called for, or as otherwise directed in writing by
 the Engineer. The length will be measured horizontally along the centerline of each roadway or
 ramp.
 501.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT.
 501.05.1 General. The accepted quantities of "Portland Cement Concrete Pavement" and
 "Portland Cement Concrete Base" will be paid for at their respective contract unit prices per
 square yard as listed in the Proposal. The prices so-stated constitute full and complete
 compensation for all labor, materials and equipment, including reinforcing steel, dowels, joint
 material, and other incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted by the
 Engineer.
 501.05.2 Price Adjustments. Where the average thickness of pavement is deficient in
 thickness by more than 3/8-inch, but not more than 1 inch, payment will be made at an adjusted
 price as specified in the following table:
 
 5-12

 cement being used. Deliveries may be directed to the site or through a regional distribution base.
 No cement may be used for the project without a Certificate of Compliance issued by the
 manufacturer.
 In addition, the following will be required:
 a. The manufacturer's Certificate of Compliance as referenced above and signed by the
 company representative having legal binding authority shall accompany each shipment of
 cement. The Certificate of Compliance shall conform to the Department's requirements. Copies
 of a standard form are available from the Department upon request.
 b. Each shipment or truckload thus received will be sampled and tested by the Engineer.
 If rejected, the degree to which a structure has been affected by the use of this non-conforming
 product will be assessed and either the removal of the structure or an adjustment in price will be
 warranted.
 c. Under all steps and conditions, delivery shall be made in weatherproofed and sealed
 transporting equipment. All cement shall be well protected from moisture and contaminants. Any
 cement which fails to meet any of the requirements mentioned above shall be rejected and
 removed from the work. Any hydraulic cement stored by the Contractor for a period longer than
 60 days shall be retested in accordance with AASHTO M85 by an independent laboratory at the
 Contractor's expense and approved by the Engineer before being used on the work.
 601.02.2 Chemical Admixtures. Previously approved admixtures shall be used when specified
 or ordered by the Engineer, or may be used at the Contractor's option if approved by the Engineer
 as described herein.
 Admixtures used in Portland cement concrete shall conform to the requirements of
 SECTION M.02. No admixture shall be used in the work unless it is approved by the Engineer.
 Physical and chemical properties of admixtures shall be uniform throughout their use in
 the work. Should it be found that an admixture as furnished is not uniform in properties, its use
 shall be discontinued.
 If more than one admixture type or brand is used, said admixtures shall be compatible with
 each other so that the desirable effects of all admixtures used will be realized.
 When the Contractor proposes to use an admixture of a brand and type on the
 Department's Approved Materials List, he shall furnish a Certificate of Compliance from the
 manufacturer, certifying that the admixture furnished conforms to the chemical and physical
 requirements as specified by the Department. The Engineer may take samples for testing at any
 time.
 
 6-3

 appropriate pay items at no extra compensation. The quantity of admixture used shall be in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommended minimum and maximum dosage range.
 Air-entraining admixture shall be used in amounts to produce a concrete having the
 specified air-content.
 Chemical admixtures, including air-entraining admixtures, shall be dispensed in liquid
 form. If more than one chemical admixture is used in the concrete mix, a separate dispensing
 measuring unit shall be provided for each admixture. Dispensing shall be accomplished in
 accordance with manufacturer's approved recommendations. Dispensers for chemical
 admixtures shall have sufficient capacity to measure at one time the prescribed quantity required
 for each batch of concrete. Each dispenser shall include a graduated measuring unit into which
 liquid admixtures are measured to within plus or minus 2 percent of the prescribed quantity
 (volume or weight, as applicable) for each batch of concrete. Dispensers shall be located and
 maintained so that the graduations can be accurately read from the point at which proportioning
 operations are controlled to permit a visual check of batching accuracy prior to discharge. Each
 dispensing unit shall be clearly marked for the type and quantity of admixture.
 Each liquid admixture dispensing system shall be equipped with a sampling device
 consisting of a valve located in a safe and readily accessible position such that a sample of the
 admixture may be withdrawn by the Engineer.
 For all types of admixtures the water content as determined by manufacturer's
 recommendations and/or Departmental testing must be taken into account when calculating the
 total unit free water of the concrete mix.
 601.02.3 Pozzolans. Mineral admixtures such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
 may be permitted as a partial replacement of Portland cement in any concrete as approved by
 the Engineer. Mineral admixtures shall conform to the requirements of both Subsection M.02.06
 and SECTION 602 of these Specifications, and furthermore, shall be listed on the Department's
 Approved Materials List. The Engineer will evaluate requests of alternate cement/pozzolans
 combinations in the concrete mix design. The Engineer's evaluation may include laboratory
 testing, field trial runs and other related work required to determine equivalency with specified
 materials, mix designs, and performance.
 The Contractor shall provide suitable means for storing and protecting the pozzolans
 against moisture. Pozzolans that become partially hydrated or contain lumps will be rejected.

 601.02.4 Aggregates. Coarse and Fine Aggregates shall conform to the requirements of
 Subsections M.01.05 and M.02.02, respectively, of these Specifications.
 a. Sources of Aggregates. Aggregates shall be obtained from sources which have been
 previously tested and approved by the State. Results and information of such tests may be
 obtained from the Engineer upon request. If the Contractor proposes to obtain aggregates from
 sources that have not been tested and approved, the Contractor shall:
 1. Notify the State three months in advance of use, together with relevant test results in
 accordance with SECTIONS M.01 and M.02. These tests shall be performed by an AASHTO or
 CCRL accredited laboratory and signed by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer.
 2. Submit report of test results ASTM C295 "Petrographic Examination of Aggregates
 for Concrete" for the proposed aggregates. This test shall be performed by an independent
 laboratory and signed by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer.
 3. Provide a sufficient quantity of aggregate samples to the Engineer for verification
 testing three months in advance of use.
 4. Assume all costs for sampling and testing, except for the cost of verification testing
 which shall be borne by the State.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to the fact that the above requirements may have
 a direct impact on project schedules.
 All proposed aggregates from sources not previously approved will be tested by the State
 and must produce concrete which has freeze-thaw durability of 80 percent as determined by the
 relative dynamic modulus (ASTM C215, Transverse Method) at 300 cycles as tested in
 accordance with ASTM C666 - Procedure A, as modified by the Department. Copies of
 modification may be obtained from the Engineer upon request.
 Aggregates shall be handled or conveyed from stockpiles or other sources to the batching
 plant in such manner as to secure a uniform grading of the material.
 The batch plant site, layout, equipment and provisions for transporting material shall be
 such as to assure a continuous supply of material to the work. Stockpiles shall be built up in
 layers of not more than 3 feet in thickness. Each layer shall be completely in place before
 beginning the next, which shall not be allowed to "cone" down over the next lower layer.
 The Contractor, at his expense, shall provide safe and suitable facilities for obtaining and
 storing samples of aggregates.
 Aggregates from different sources and of different gradings shall not be stockpiled
 together. Aggregates that have become segregated, mixed with foreign materials, or
 contaminated by aggregates of different gradings shall not be used. All aggregates produced or
 handled by hydraulic methods shall be stockpiled or binned for draining at least 12 hours before
 being batched. Rail shipments requiring more than 12 hours will be accepted as adequate
 binning only if the car bodies permit free drainage. In case the aggregates contain high or
 nonuniform moisture content, storage or stockpile periods in excess of 12 hours may be required
 6-5
 
 by the Engineer. In no event shall the moisture content of the fine aggregate at the time of
 batching exceed 8 percent of its dry weight.
 601.02.5 Water. Water used in mixing and curing of concrete shall be subject to approval and
 shall conform to Subsection M.02.07 of these Specifications.

 Note 1:
 i) In general, with the exception of the Class Z mix, if additional workability is desired the Engineer
 may allow a slump increase of up to 1 inch if an ASTM C494 Type A - Water Reducing Admixture
 is used, or an increase of up to 3 inches if an ASTM C494 Type F or G - High Range Water
 Reducing admixture is used. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to assure that the required
 slump is maintained at all times.
 ii) ASTM C494 Type F or G - High Range Water Reducing Admixture is required when concrete
 is to be placed by pumping equipment. Admixtures must be used in accordance with manufacturers' recommended dosages.
 
 Slump shall be determined in accordance with AASHTO T119, and air content in
 accordance with AASHTO T152. Compressive strength test specimens shall be made and cured
 in accordance with AASHTO T23 and tested in accordance with AASHTO T22.
 b. Design and Approval of Concrete Mixtures. The Contractor shall design the
 concrete mixtures for each class of concrete specified. The concrete mix components shall be
 proportioned using the absolute volumes method in accordance with the requirements for each
 class as specified herein and methods outlined in the American Concrete Institute's "Manual of
 Concrete Practice,” 2000 edition; Standard 211.1, "Recommended Practice for Selecting
 Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete"; and Standard 301, "Specifications for
 Structural Concrete in Buildings - Section 4.2.3.3.”
 Step 1. Laboratory Testing. At least 60 days prior to production, the Contractor shall
 submit in writing its concrete mix design on Department forms, and trial batch reports supported
 by laboratory test data to the Engineer for review.
 The trial batch test reports shall include the following information:
 (a) Contractor/Testing Laboratory name.
 (b) The coarse and fine aggregate gradations and sources.
 (c) The fine aggregate finess modulus (FM).
 (d) Any other pertinent information (i.e., aggregate specific gravities, unit weights,
 absorptions, or any other material properties).
 (e) Date of mixing.
 (f) Mixing equipment and procedures used.
 (g) The size of batch in cubic yards.
 (h) Weight/volume, type, source/manufacturer of all ingredients used in the mix.
 (i) Slump.
 
 6-7
 
 (j) The air content of the mix.
 (k) Concrete temperature.
 (l) Unit weight of fresh concrete.
 (m) Curing method, age at time of testing and compressive strength of concrete.
 Note: All testing shall conform to the applicable AASHTO and/or ASTM requirements listed
 in these Specifications.
 All concrete mix designs with trial batch test reports shall be signed by a Rhode Island
 Registered Professional Engineer.
 Step 2. Trial Runs. Once the concrete mix design provided by the Contractor has been
 reviewed and no exception taken by the Engineer, the Contractor will conduct trial runs prior to
 production using the submitted mix design's component materials and proportions including the
 amount of admixtures which will be necessary to meet the specifications and produce concrete of
 the required plasticity, workability, air content, compressive strength, flexural strength, or any other
 specified concrete property. The Contractor shall conduct the trial runs by employing the concrete
 batch plant, mixer and handling equipment which the Contractor proposes to use in production. All
 equipment employed in the batching, mixing, transporting, and testing shall be properly calibrated
 and meet the requirements listed herein prior to commencement of the trial runs. The Contractor
 shall attempt to produce concrete using the maximum amount of water and air content specified
 in the submitted mix design during the trial runs. The Engineer shall be notified by the Contractor
 at least 48 hours in advance of performing the trial runs so that he can witness the test procedures.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to the time required to test trial runs. The Contractor
 shall be responsible for production of trial runs at a sufficiently early date so that the commencement of the work is not delayed.
 Once the concrete temperature, slump and air content are tested and found to be in
 compliance with the Specifications listed herein, the Engineer shall fabricate compressive strength
 specimens to be tested at 28 days or earlier as determined by the Engineer.
 When all specified concrete parameters have been met, the Engineer shall approve the
 proposed mix design for production.
 The approved mix design proportions will govern during the progress of the work.
 No changes in the sources or character of the materials shall be made without approval of
 the Engineer. New materials shall not be used until a revised mix design and new proportions
 based on laboratory tests and trial mixes are approved by the Engineer.
 601.03.2 Batching Plants and Equipment.
 a. General. Equipment and tools necessary for handling materials and performing all
 parts of the work must meet with the approval of the Engineer as to design, capacity, and
 
 6-8
 
 mechanical condition and the equipment must be available sufficiently ahead of the start of
 construction operations to be examined thoroughly for approval.
 The batching plant shall include bins, weighing hoppers, and scales for the fine aggregate
 and for each size of coarse aggregate. Cement shall be weighed independently on a separate
 scale. The weighing hopper shall be properly sealed and vented.
 b. Bins and Hoppers. Bins and hoppers with adequate separate compartments for fine
 aggregate and for each size of coarse aggregate shall be provided in the batching plant.
 c. Cement Silos. Separate silos or holding bins shall be provided for each cement type
 and pozzolan. The bins shall protect the cement and pozzolan from rain and moisture.
 A log must be maintained showing deliveries which will include the brand, supply, location,
 type, quantity and date. This log shall be maintained by the Contractor on a weekly basis to fully
 document the cement on hand. All received cement must conform to the specified quality
 requirements. This log will also contain data showing the quantitative distribution of all cement
 used on both private and State projects. Copies of the log will be submitted to the Engineer upon
 request and attested to by the Contractor or his representative.
 d. Discharge Chutes. All discharge chutes shall be arranged so that materials will not
 lodge or be lost on discharge.
 e. Scales. The scales for weighing aggregates and cement shall be either the beam-type
 or the springless-dial type of standard make and design. They shall be accurate within 0.50
 percent throughout the range of use and have minimum graduations not greater than 0.50 percent
 and shall be readable and sensitive to 0.25 percent or less. The preceding percentages are based
 on total batch weight.
 When beam-type scales are used, provision, such as a "telltale" dial, shall be made for
 indicating to the operator that the required load in the weighing is being approached. A device on
 weighing beams shall indicate critical position clearly. Poises shall be designed to be locked in any
 position and to prevent unauthorized change. The scale, weigh beam and "telltale" device shall
 be in full view of the operator while charging the hopper, and he shall have convenient access to
 all controls.
 Scales shall be sealed as often as the Engineer may deem necessary to assure their
 continued accuracy. The Contractor shall have on hand not less than ten, 50-pound weights for
 frequent testing of all scales. For each scale, a cradle or platform, approved by the Engineer shall
 be provided for applying the test weights.
 All plant scales and water meters, including truck scales, involved in the plant operation
 shall be tested at the expense of the Contractor by a commercial scale company as follows:
 1. Annually prior to use in State work.
 2. At intervals of not more than 60 calendar days.
 3. At any time ordered by the Engineer.
 
 6-9
 
 Note: Every 60 days, the plant owner must submit to the Engineer a certificate from the
 commercial scale company making the checks attesting to the accuracy of all plant scales. The certificate
 must be signed by the technician or a responsible representative of the scale company making the check.
 f. Automation and Recordation. Plants producing Portland cement concrete for the State
 of Rhode Island shall conform to the following plant equipment requirements:
 1. Automatic Proportioning. Portland cement concrete shall be produced in batch type
 mixing plants equipped with approved automatic proportioning devices. Such devices shall include
 equipment for accurately proportioning batches of the various components of the mixture by weight
 or volume in the proper sequence. Cement and aggregates shall be proportioned by weight.
 Water and admixtures shall be proportioned by weight or volume. The batch weights will have to
 be adjusted periodically to take into account the actual moisture content of the aggregates at time
 of use. Plants shall be automatically equipped to control the batching sequence and timing of
 operations. There shall be auxiliary interlock cutoff circuits to interrupt and stop the automatic
 cycling of the batching operations at any time an error in weighing occurs, when an aggregate bin
 becomes empty or when there is a malfunction of any portion of the control system.
 2. Recording Equipment. The plant shall be equipped with a DIGITAL RECORDER which
 will automatically print the following data on delivery tickets and it shall reproduce the reading of
 the scale being recorded within ±0.1 percent of scale capacity.

 inspection/witnessing has been accomplished.
 There shall be sufficient copies of delivery tickets to provide a copy for the plant inspector
 and a copy for the Resident Engineer for permanent project record.
 3. Equipment Failure. If at any time the recording devices become inoperative, the plant
 may be allowed to batch materials for a period of not more than 1 work day from the time of
 breakdown, if approved by the Engineer. Written permission of the Engineer will be required for
 periods of operations without automatic proportioning facilities longer than 1 work day. As a
 condition for continued use with inoperative recording devices the Contractor will be required to
 manually record all required information on all delivery tickets.
 4. Batching Controls. Batching controls shall be electrically interlocked with the scales
 to prevent cycling or recycling of batching until scales tare zero.
 The batching controls shall meet the following tolerances with respect to the various
 components weighed in each batch:

 The total weight of the batch shall not vary more than ±1.0 percent from the theoretical
 design weight.
 601.03.3 Concrete Mixing, Delivery, and Discharge. Concrete may be mixed at the site of
 construction, at a central point, or in transit mixers, all in accordance with these Specifications.
 
 6-11
 
 a. Equipment - Mixers and Agitators. Mixers may be stationary mixers or truck mixers.
 Agitators may be truck mixers or truck agitators.
 Stationary mixers shall be equipped with a metal plate or plates on which are plainly marked
 the mixing speed of the drum or paddles, and the maximum capacity in terms of the volume of
 mixed concrete. When used for the complete mixing of concrete, stationary mixers shall be
 equipped with an acceptable timing device that will not permit the batch to be discharged until the
 specified mixing time has elapsed.
 Each truck mixer or agitator shall have attached thereto in a prominent place a metal plate
 or plates on which are plainly marked the gross volume of the drum, the capacity of the drum or
 container in terms of the volume of the mixed concrete, and the minimum and maximum mixing
 speeds of rotation of the drum, blades, or paddles. When the concrete is truck-mixed the volume
 of concrete mixed per batch shall not exceed the mixer's nominal capacity as shown on the
 manufacturer's standard rating plate on the mixer, except that an overload up to 10 percent above
 the mixer's nominal capacity may be permitted, provided concrete test data for strength,
 segregation, and uniform consistency are satisfactory, and provided no spillage of concrete takes
 place.
 Truck mixers and agitators shall be equipped with means by which the number of
 revolutions of the drum, blades, or paddles may be readily verified. Truck mixers must also have
 a means of measuring the amount of water added during retempering such as a water meter or
 other method approved by the Engineer.
 All stationary and truck mixers shall be capable of combining the ingredients of the concrete
 within the specified time or number of revolutions specified herein into a thoroughly mixed and
 uniform mass and of discharging the concrete so that no less than 5 of the 6 requirements shown
 in AASHTO M157-93 Table A1 shall have been met.
 The agitator shall be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete in a thoroughly mixed and
 uniform mass and of discharging the concrete with a satisfactory degree of uniformity as defined
 by AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1.
 Slump tests of individual samples taken after discharge of approximately 15 percent and
 85 percent of the load may be made for a quick check of the probable degree of uniformity. These
 two samples shall be obtained within an elapsed time of not more than 15 minutes. If these slumps
 differ more than that specified in AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1, the mixer or agitator shall not be
 used unless the condition is corrected.
 Mixers and agitators shall be examined or weighted routinely as frequently as necessary
 to detect changes in condition due to accumulations of hardened concrete or mortar and examined
 to detect wear of blades. When such changes are extensive enough to affect the mixer
 performance, the proof-tests described in AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1 shall be performed to show
 whether the correction of deficiencies is required.
 b. Mixing and Delivery. Ready-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered to the point
 designated by the Engineer by means of one of the following combinations of operations, centralmixed and truck-mixed concrete.
 
 6-12
 
 Agitators and non-agitating equipment shall only be used for delivering pre-mixed concrete.
 Mixers and agitators shall be operated within the limits of capacity and speed of rotation
 designated by the manufacturer of the equipment.
 1. Central Mixed Concrete. Concrete that is mixed completely in a stationary mixer and
 transported to the point of delivery either in a truck agitator, or a truck mixer operating at agitating
 speed, or in non-agitating equipment approved by the Engineer and meeting the requirements
 specified herein shall conform to the following: The mixing time shall be counted from the time all
 the solid materials are in the drum. The batch shall be so charged into the mixer that some water
 will enter in advance of the cement and aggregate, and all water shall be in the drum by the end
 of the first one-fourth of the specified mixing time.
 Where no mixer performance tests are made, the acceptable mixing time for mixers having
 capacities of 1 cubic yard or less shall not be less than 1 minute. For mixers of greater capacity,
 this minimum shall be increased 15 seconds for each cubic yard or fraction thereof of additional
 capacity. For mixer performance refer to AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1.
 2. Truck Mixed Concrete is that which is completely mixed in a truck mixer, 70 to 100
 revolutions at the mixing speed designated by the manufacturer, to produce the uniformity of
 concrete indicated in AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1. Concrete uniformity tests shall be made in
 accordance with AASHTO M157-93 and if requirements for uniformity of concrete indicated in
 AASHTO M157-93 Annex A1 are not met with 100 revolutions of mixing, after all ingredients,
 including water, are in the drum, that mixer shall not be used until the condition is corrected.
 When satisfactory performance is found in one truck mixer, the performance of mixers of
 substantially the same design and condition of blades may be regarded as satisfactory. Additional
 revolutions of the mixer beyond the number found to produce the required uniformity of concrete
 shall be at a designated agitating speed.
 3. Use of Nonagitating Equipment. Central-mixed concrete may be transported in
 suitable nonagitating equipment approved by the Engineer. The proportions of the concrete shall
 be approved by the Engineer and the following limitations shall apply:
 Bodies of nonagitating equipment shall be smooth, watertight, metal containers equipped
 with gates that will permit control of the discharge of the concrete. Covers shall be provided for
 protection against the weather when required by the Engineer.
 The concrete shall be delivered to the site of the work in a thoroughly mixed and uniform
 mass and discharged with a satisfactory degree of uniformity as prescribed in AASHTO M157-93
 Annex A1.
 c. Discharge.
 1. Time and Rate. The time elapsing from the time water is added to the mix until the
 concrete is in the forms at the site of the work shall not exceed 90 minutes when hauled in truckmixers or truck-agitators, or 30 minutes when concrete is hauled by nonagitating equipment.
 Concrete not discharged into its final place within 90 minutes (30 minutes when using nonagitating
 
 6-13
 
 equipment) after batching shall be wasted at no additional expense to the State, even if a retarder
 is used.
 The rate of discharge of mixed concrete from transit mixers or agitators shall be controlled
 by the speed of rotation of the drum in the discharge direction with the discharge gate fully open.
 These limits shall not be exceeded.
 If the discharge of concrete is accomplished by tilting the body, the surface of the load shall
 be restrained by a suitable baffle to prevent segregation.
 2. Retempering. Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be
 permitted until after arrival on the job site and only when delivered in truck mixers. Additional water
 or admixtures may be added to the batch materials and additional mixing performed to increase
 the slump or air content to meet the specified requirements, if permitted by the Engineer, and
 provided that:
 (a) All these operations are performed within 60 minutes after the initial mixing operation,
 (b) The maximum water-cement ratio is not exceeded,
 (c) The admixture dosages do not exceed manufacturer's recommendations.
 If additional water is to be incorporated into the concrete, the drum shall be revolved not
 less than 30 revolutions at mixing speed immediately after retempering the concrete and before
 discharge is commenced.
 All admixtures shall be added at the plant. The Engineer may approve chemical admixture
 (superplasticizers, air entrainment, etc.) adjustments at the job site by means of a metered,
 pressurized wand with the exception of silica fume. The manufacturer’s recommended dosage
 shall not be exceeded.
 If additional admixtures are incorporated into the concrete, the drum shall be revolved not
 less than 30-to-60 revolutions at mixing speed immediately after retempering the concrete and
 before discharge is commenced.
 Concrete that is not within the specified slump or air content limits at the time of placement
 shall not be used. The Contractor shall assume the responsibility of any concrete retempering at
 the site as permitted by the Engineer. Retempering with admixtures will be permitted only with the
 approval of the Engineer or when specifically provided for in the Contract.
 601.03.4 Limitations of Mixing. No concrete shall be mixed, placed, or finished when the natural
 light is insufficient, unless an adequate artificial lighting system is operational and approved by the
 Engineer.
 The Contractor, at all times during and immediately after placement, shall protect the
 concrete from adverse affects of rain.
 
 6-14
 
 When there is a probability of air temperature below 35OF, the Contractor shall submit for
 approval by the Engineer, a cold weather concreting and curing plan detailing the methods and
 equipment which will be used to assure that the concrete temperature does not fall below 50OF
 during the first 5 days after placement and shall be considered the protection period. Concrete
 mixing operations during cold weather shall conform to Subsection 601.03.5; Cold Weather
 Concrete.
 Concrete mixing operations during hot weather shall conform to Subsection 601.03.6; Hot
 Weather Concrete.
 601.03.5 Cold Weather Concrete. When concreting is authorized by the Engineer during cold
 weather, the aggregates and/or water may be heated by either steam or dry heat prior to being
 placed in the mixer. The apparatus used shall heat the mass uniformly and shall be so arranged
 as to preclude the possible occurrence of overheated areas which might injure the materials.
 Unless otherwise authorized, the temperature of the mixed concrete shall be not less than 50OF,
 and not more than 90OF at the time of placing it in the forms.
 If the air temperature is 35OF or less at the time of placing concrete, the Engineer may
 require the water and the aggregates to be heated to not less than 70OF, nor more than 150OF, and
 be verifiable by a temperature measuring device. No concrete shall be placed on frozen subgrade
 nor shall frozen aggregates be used in the concrete.
 Stockpiled aggregates may be heated by the use of dry heat or steam. Aggregates shall
 not be heated directly by gas or oil flame or on sheet metal over fire.
 When aggregates are heated in bins, steam-coil or water-coil heating, or other methods
 which will not be detrimental to the aggregates, may be used. The use of live steam on or through
 binned aggregates will not be permitted without approval by the Engineer.
 Sufficient heating devices of a type approved by the Engineer shall be installed under an
 enclosure or covering, capable of maintaining at all times and under all weather conditions during
 the protection period, a uniform concrete temperature of not less than 50OF. Heating devices shall
 be arranged to prevent overheating any areas of forms or concrete. Before any concrete is placed,
 the enclosure and heating apparatus shall be as nearly complete as the placing of the concrete will
 permit. The minimum temperature shall be continuously maintained around deposited concrete
 for a period of 5 days immediately after concrete has been placed and then reduced gradually so
 the concrete will not be subjected to sudden change in temperature. When permitted by the
 Engineer, the heating period may be reduced when the concrete units involved will not be subjected
 to any appreciable bending stress from dead or live load until after seasonal conditions have
 permitted normal curing.
 In general, a steam heating system may be used to supply heat during the protection
 period. Auxiliary devices such as stoves, covered salamanders with stacks or unit heaters shall
 be provided for use during the periods required for preheating the forms, reinforcing steel and
 previously placed concrete to 50OF minimum prior to placing the concrete, during placing of
 concrete, during the time required for the removal of forms and during the surface finishing
 operations.
 When approved by the Engineer, heat for protection may be supplied by any method which
 will maintain the required temperature of not less than 50OF. When methods other than live steam
 
 6-15
 
 are used, provisions shall be made in the enclosure being heated to maintain a humid condition
 of sufficient vapor (minimum humidity of 100 percent) content to prevent the moisture in the
 concrete from being evaporated.
 The Contractor shall provide adequate fire protection when heating is in progress and shall
 maintain watchmen or other attendants to keep heating units in continuous operation. The use of
 open fires will not be permitted.
 When approved by the Engineer, concrete may be protected and cured by the use of
 insulating materials of sufficient thickness to properly maintain the concrete at the specified
 minimum temperature. The insulating materials and methods of application shall meet with the
 approval of the Engineer. In general, the insulating material used on vertical forms shall consist
 of blankets having a durable liner on the side exposed to the weather. The liners shall be asphaltbonded to both sides of the insulating mat. The insulation material shall be applied tightly against
 the wood form with the nailing flanges extending out from the blanket so they can be stapled or
 battened to the sides of the horizontal or vertical studs, spaced as required. The top of all piers,
 abutments and like concrete shall be covered with the insulating blanket, tightly secured to prevent
 loss of heat. Areas around protruding reinforcing which cannot be protected with the insulation
 blankets shall be first covered with sufficient straw or hay to prevent loss of heat from the concrete.
 In addition to the above, tarpaulins shall be used as an overall cover on top of such concrete.
 Failure to attain satisfactory control and results with insulation materials will be cause for rejection.
 The Contractor will keep a daily permanent record of the concrete surface temperatures
 throughout the curing period with the use of a 24-hour temperature recording device (disc or other
 approved type). The Engineer will retain these records.
 During freezing weather, all keyways, anchor bolt holes or other depressions in exposed
 horizontal concrete surfaces shall be sealed against the admission of water, and any damage to
 the concrete due to the freezing of water in such depressions shall be repaired if practicable, or the
 concrete shall be replaced by the Contractor at his expense and as directed by the Engineer.
 Although permission may be granted to mix and place concrete under the conditions
 described above, the Contractor is not relieved of any responsibility for obtaining satisfactory
 results. Unsatisfactory concrete placed under such conditions shall be removed and replaced at
 the Contractor's expense.
 601.03.6 Hot Weather Concrete. For the purpose of these Specifications, Hot Weather shall be
 as defined in The American Concrete Institute Manual of Concrete Practice, 1993 Edition. During
 concreting operations in hot weather, appropriate measures shall be taken to reduce the hazards
 of increased rate of cement hydration, flash set, loss of water due to evaporation, high concrete
 ingredient temperatures, and the increased difficulty of concrete placing and finishing. The following
 requirements shall be met during concrete placement operations in hot weather:
 a. Concrete Temperature. The temperature of the concrete at the point of discharge shall
 not exceed 90OF.
 
 6-16
 
 b. Cooling Materials. The Contractor may reduce the temperature of the concrete by
 cooling one or more of several ingredients. The aggregates may be cooled by fogging, or other
 suitable means which will not result in a high variation of moisture content within the stockpile.
 Chipped or crushed ice may be used in the mix as a portion of the mixing water on a pound for
 pound basis, provided such measure is determined at the time it is placed in the mix.
 If used, all ice shall be melted before the batch is discharged from the mixing unit. Water
 may also be cooled by refrigeration or other means which provide a uniform mixing water
 temperature.
 c. Concrete Placing. Immediately before the concrete is placed, the forms and
 reinforcement steel shall be cooled by spraying with water. In no case shall there be any
 standing water in the concrete forms as a result of the spraying procedures. The Contractor shall
 have sufficient skilled men and adequate equipment to place the concrete without delays which
 may cause excessive slump loss and evaporation due to over-mixing or exposure before it is
 placed.
 d. Finishing. To prevent thermal and shrinkage cracking resulting from moisture loss, the
 Contractor may be required to furnish wind screens, to use water fogging, or other approved means
 of supplying moisture. Finishing operations shall follow as closely as practicable behind the placing
 operation so that curing may begin as soon as possible.
 601.03.7 Testing of Concrete.
 a. Process Control of Concrete. In the production and placement of all Portland cement
 concrete, the Contractor shall be responsible for the process control of all materials during the
 handling, blending, mixing and placement operations.
 The Contractor shall have a competent and experienced concrete technician in charge of
 the mixing operations and overall quality control. Production control procedures shall be such to
 insure that the concrete produced complies with these Specifications.
 The Contractor shall furnish a minimum of one concrete specimen curing box that meets
 the requirements of Subsection 929.03.6c of these Specifications. The curing box will be used
 for the curing of acceptance concrete test specimens and it will be required for all classes of
 concrete.
 b. Acceptance Sampling and Testing. The Contractor shall afford the Engineer all
 reasonable access, without charge, for making necessary checks of the production facilities and
 securing and furnishing the necessary samples to determine if the concrete is being produced in
 accordance with the Specifications.
 Samples of fresh concrete for testing shall be taken after all concrete retempering is
 performed. When sampling from within the forms is impractical, samples shall be taken at the
 nearest accessible point in the conveyance system prior to placement into the forms.
 Acceptance sampling and testing shall be in accordance with the Rhode Island
 Department of Transportation Project Schedule for the Sampling, Testing and Certification of
 
 6-17
 
 Materials and/or as modified in these Specifications. Sampling and testing shall be in accordance
 with the applicable requirements as follows:
 1.
 
 Sampling for temperature, air content, and slump; AASHTO T141.
 
 2.
 
 Air Content; AASHTO T152.
 
 3.
 
 Slump; AASHTO T119.
 
 4.
 
 7 and 28-Day Compressive Strength; AASHTO T23 and AASHTO T22.
 
 5.
 
 Unit Weight and Temperature; AASHTO T121.
 
 Every batch shall be sampled and tested for air content, slump and temperature during
 concrete placement or production (100-percent sampling and testing).
 Random sampling and testing for air content, slump and temperature may be substituted
 for 100-percent sampling and testing if test results are shown to be within the specification
 limitations. However, 100-percent sampling and testing will be reinstated if a test result for any
 random sample is outside the specification limitations for air content, slump, or concrete
 temperature.
 Compressive strength test specimens shall be standard 6" x 12" cylinders unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 c. Acceptance Plan. The following is the acceptance plan necessary to obtain samples,
 perform tests and provide inspection of the work. The terms used in this acceptance plan are
 defined as follows:
 1. Acceptance Plan. The method of taking and making measurements on a sample, for
 the purpose of determining the acceptability of a Lot of material or construction.
 2. Lot. An isolated quantity of material from a single source. A measured amount of
 construction produced by the same process.
 3. Sublot. Equal divisions or portions of a Lot.
 4. Random Sample. A sample chosen in such a manner that each increment in the Lot
 has an equal probability of being selected.
 5. Acceptance. As defined in Table 3 - Lot Acceptance Schedule.
 6. Rejection. When used in this context "rejection" shall mean remove, dispose and
 replace at the Contractor's expense, or at the discretion of the Engineers' "rejection" may imply
 acceptance at a lower price.
 7. Batch. A quantity of concrete not exceeding 10 cubic yards produced and delivered.
 
 6-18
 
 d. Twenty Eight (28)-Day Concrete Compressive Strength. For a given class of
 concrete, the portions of a concrete structure constructed during one continuous concrete
 placement operation shall be called the Lot.
 The Lot shall be divided into Sublots when the total quantity of concrete placed for each
 continuous concrete operation exceeding 150 cubic yards, as such, the Sublot shall represent a
 quantity of 150 cubic yards or less.
 Six cylinders shall be cast for each 150 cubic yards or less of concrete delivered for each
 class of concrete. The casting of any set of 6 cylinders from the same sample of concrete shall
 not be permitted. The following procedure shall be used to insure Random Sampling: each
 quantity of 150 cubic yards or less shall be divided into thirds and 2 cylinders shall be cast from
 each third.
 e. Evaluation. Acceptance for compressive strength will be evaluated relative to
 compliance with the minimum 28-day compressive strength (f'c) shown on the Plans for each class
 of concrete produced in accordance with TABLE 3 - Lot Acceptance Schedule.
 Three cylinders randomly selected from each set of 6 cylinders representing 150 cubic
 yards or less of concrete placed shall be tested for 28-day compressive strength.
 f. Case A: Lot Quantity of 150 Cubic Yards or Less. When the lot quantities are 150
 cubic yards or less, the average 28-day compressive strength of 3 cylinders selected from a set
 of 6 cylinders and the Range, the difference between the largest and the smallest test result, will
 be used to calculate the acceptance of the Lot. The following formula will be used to calculate the
 Lot Acceptance Test Result (LATR).

 6-20
 
 Acceptance at the 0.70 or 0.50 Lot Pay Factor (LPF) in lieu of remove, dispose and
 replacement will be as determined by the Engineer on the basis of the effect of the defective Lot
 on the structural integrity of the concrete structure.
 The Contractor may elect to remove and dispose any defective material and replace it with
 new material to avoid a pay factor of less than 1.00. Any such new material will be sampled,
 tested, and evaluated for acceptance in accordance with the applicable requirements of this
 SECTION 601.
 The Engineer may reject any quantity of material which appears to be defective based on
 visual inspection or test results. Such rejected material shall not be used in the work and the
 results of the tests run on the rejected material will not be included in the calculation of the Lot
 Acceptance Test Results.
 h. Independent Assurance Testing. Verification testing shall be performed by the State
 in accordance with the Rhode Island Department of Transportation publication for the Project
 Schedule for Sampling, Testing, and Certification of Materials.
 601.03.8 Curing.
 a. Curing Plan. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval a plan detailing
 his scheme for achieving the curing of the concrete for the various structural elements as required
 by these Specifications. This detailed plan shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
 1. Curing method.
 2. Providing for enclosures, indicating method of holding down enclosure safely in place.
 3. Heat devices, types and location around the structure.
 4. Method of monitoring the temperature of hardened concrete.
 5. Back up systems as required.
 The temperature on the surface of the hardened concrete shall not fall below 500F at any
 time during the first 5 days of curing.
 Curing operations on all exposed surfaces shall commence immediately after the placing
 and finishing operations have been completed. The method of curing selected shall be that allowed
 under the various concrete items and shall be continued throughout the work unless the Engineer
 determines that the curing plan results in unsatisfactory concrete curing.
 Any changes in the method of curing must be authorized in writing. In all cases in which
 curing requires the use of water, the curing shall have prior right to all water supply or suppliers.
 Failure to provide sufficient cover material of whatever kind the Contractor may elect to use, or lack
 of water to adequately take care of both curing and other requirements, shall be cause for
 immediate suspension of concreting operations. The concrete shall not be left exposed for more
 than ½ hour between stages of curing and during the curing period.
 
 6-21
 
 All newly placed concrete shall be cured in accordance with the methods set forth in these
 Specifications.
 b. Water Method. The concrete shall be kept continuously wet by the application of water
 for a minimum period of 7 days after the concrete has been placed.
 Cotton mats, rugs or carpets may be used as a curing medium to retain the moisture during
 the curing period. When cotton mats, rugs or carpets are to be used to retain the moisture, the
 entire surface of the concrete shall be kept damp by applying water with a nozzle so that the flow
 is atomized in the form of a mist rather than a spray, until the surface of the concrete is covered
 with the curing medium. The moisture from the nozzle shall not be applied under pressure directly
 upon the concrete and shall not be allowed to accumulate on the concrete in a quantity sufficient
 to cause a flow or wash the surface. At the expiration of the curing period, the concrete surfaces
 shall be cleared of all curing mediums.
 When concrete bridge decks and flat slabs are to be cured without the use of a moisture
 retaining medium, the entire surface shall be kept damp by the application of water with an
 atomizing nozzle as specified in the preceding paragraph, until the concrete has set, after which
 the entire surface of the concrete shall be sprinkled continuously with water for a period of not less
 than 7 days.
 c. Curing Compound Method. Concrete that is treated with any additional coatings or
 overlays shall not be cured as provided in this Section.
 Surfaces of the concrete which are exposed to the air shall be sprayed uniformly with a
 curing compound.
 Curing compound shall be applied at a rate in accordance with the manufacturer's
 recommendation.
 Runs, sags, thin areas, skips, or holidays in the applied curing compound shall be evidence
 that the application is not satisfactory. If a clear color curing compound is used, a fugitive dye shall
 be added to the curing compound to insure complete coverage.
 Curing compounds shall be applied using power operated atomizing spray equipment. The
 power operated spraying equipment shall be equipped with an operational pressure gauge and a
 means of controlling the pressure.
 The curing compound shall be applied to the concrete following the surface finishing
 operation immediately before the moisture sheen disappears from the surface, but before any
 drying, shrinkage, or craze cracks begin to appear. In the event of any drying or cracking of the
 surface, application of water with an atomizing nozzle as specified above for the "Water Method,"
 shall be started immediately and shall be continued until application of the compound is started or
 resumed. However, the compound shall not be applied over any resulting freestanding waters.
 Should the film of compound be damaged from any cause before the expiration of 7 days after the
 concrete is placed in the case of structures and 72 hours in the case of pavement, the damaged
 portion shall be repaired immediately with additional compound.
 
 6-22
 
 All curing compounds shall remain sprayable at temperatures above 400F. They shall not
 be diluted or altered in any manner after manufacture.
 When the curing compound is shipped in tanks or tank trucks, a shipping invoice shall
 accompany each load. The invoice shall contain the same information as that required herein for
 container labels.
 Curing compounds may be sampled by the Engineer at the source of supply or at the job
 site, or at both locations.
 The curing compound shall be used within 120 days of its manufacture.
 All tests will be conducted in accordance with the latest test methods of the American
 Society for Testing Materials.
 d. Waterproof Membrane Method. The exposed finished surfaces of concrete shall be
 sprayed with water, using a nozzle that atomizes the flow so that a mist and not a spray is formed,
 until the concrete has set, after which the curing membrane shall be placed. The curing membrane
 shall remain in place for a period of not less than 72 hours.
 Sheeting material for curing concrete shall conform to the specifications of AASHTO M171
 for white reflective materials.
 The sheeting material shall be fabricated into sheets of such width as to provide a complete
 cover for the entire concrete surface. All joints in the sheets shall be securely cemented together
 in such a manner as to provide a waterproof joint. The joint seams shall have a minimum lap of
 6 inches.
 The sheets shall be securely weighted down by means satisfactory to the Engineer. No
 rocks, sand or loose debris shall be used as ballast.
 Should any portion of the sheets be broken or damaged before the expiration of 72 hours
 after being placed, the broken or damaged portions shall be immediately repaired with new sheets
 properly secured into place.
 Sections of membrane which have lost their waterproof qualities or have been damaged
 to such an extent as to render them unfit for curing the concrete shall not be used.
 e. Forms-In-Place Method. Formed surfaces of concrete may be cured by retaining the
 forms in place. The forms shall remain in place for a minimum period of 7 continuous days after
 the concrete has been placed, except that for members over 20 inches in least dimension the forms
 shall remain in place for a minimum period of 5 continuous days. The forms shall be removed no
 later than 3 weeks maximum.
 All joints in the forms and the joints between the end of forms and concrete shall be kept
 moisture tight during the curing period. Cracks in the forms and cracks between the forms and the
 concrete shall be resealed by methods subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 f. Curing Precast Concrete Members. Precast concrete members shall be cured for not
 less than 7 days in conformance with "Water Method," steam curing, or by radiant heat at the
 
 6-23
 
 option of the Contractor. Steam curing for precast members shall conform to the following
 provisions:
 1. After placement of the concrete, members shall be held for a minimum 4-hour
 presteaming period. If the ambient air temperature is below 50OF, steam shall be applied during
 the presteaming period to hold the air surrounding the member at a temperature between 50 and
 90OF.
 2. To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces during the pre-steaming period, members
 shall be covered as soon as possible after casting or the exposed surfaces shall be kept wet by fog
 spray or wet blankets.
 3. Enclosures for steam curing shall allow free circulation of steam about the member and
 shall be constructed to contain the live steam with a minimum moisture loss. The use of tarpaulins
 or similar flexible covers will be permitted, provided they are kept in good repair and secured in
 such a manner to prevent the loss of steam and moisture.
 4. Steam at the jets shall be low pressure and in a saturated condition. Steam jets shall
 not impinge directly on the concrete, test cylinders, or forms. During application of the steam the
 temperature rise within the enclosure shall not exceed 40OF per hour. The curing temperature
 throughout the enclosure shall not exceed 150OF, and shall be maintained at a constant level for
 a sufficient time necessary to develop the required transfer strength. Control cylinders shall be
 covered to prevent moisture loss and shall be placed in a location where temperature is
 representative of the average temperature of the enclosure.
 5. Calibrated temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous
 permanent record of the curing temperature shall be provided. A minimum of one temperature
 recording device per 100 feet of continuous bed length will be required for checking temperature.
 6. Once minimum transfer compressive strength is achieved, members in tension shall be
 detensioned immediately after the termination of steam curing while the concrete and forms are
 still warm or the temperature under the enclosure shall be maintained above 60OF until the stress
 is transferred to the concrete.
 7. Initial curing of precast concrete will be considered complete once specified transfer
 strength is verified by compressive strength test results.
 8. Radiant heat may be applied by means of pipes circulating steam, hot oil or hot water,
 or by electric heating elements. Radiant heat curing shall be done under a suitable enclosure to
 contain the heat and moisture loss and shall be minimized by covering all exposed concrete
 surfaces with plastic sheeting.
 If the Contractor proposes to cure by any other special method, the method and its details
 shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 601.03.9 Method for Placement of Portland Cement Concrete by Pumping. Placement of
 concrete by pumping will be permitted as approved by the Engineer. The equipment shall be so
 arranged that no vibrations result which might damage freshly placed concrete. Where concrete
 is conveyed and placed by mechanically applied pressure, the equipment shall be suitable in kind
 
 6-24
 
 and adequate in capacity for the work. The operation of the pump shall be such that a continuous
 stream of concrete without air pockets is produced. To facilitate the continuity of the stream, an
 elbow is required at the end of the discharge trunkline. When pumping is completed, the concrete
 remaining in the pipeline, if it is to be used, shall be ejected in such a manner that there will be no
 contamination of the concrete or separation of the ingredients.
 Concrete shall be placed so as to avoid segregation of materials and displacement of
 reinforcement. Prior to the actual placement of concrete, the Engineer may require the Contractor
 to demonstrate the capability of the equipment to convey the concrete mixture to maintain the
 specified quality. No further verification of the equipment's capability will be required unless
 evidence of nonuniform concrete is observed by the Engineer during placement.
 Concrete shall not come in contact with aluminum during conveying and placing operations.
 The lines shall have a minimum diameter of 5 inches. The specific pumping equipment which the
 Contractor proposes to use shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 All chutes, troughs and pipes shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened
 concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after each run; water used for flushing shall be
 discarded clear of the concrete already in place.
 Dropping concrete a distance of more than 5 feet or depositing a large quantity at any point
 and running or working it along the forms shall not be permitted.
 Special care shall be taken to fill each part of the form by depositing concrete directly in the
 form as near to its final position as possible, to work the coarser aggregates back from the face
 of the concrete and to force the concrete under and around the reinforcement. After the concrete
 has taken its initial set, care shall be exercised to avoid jarring the forms or placing any strain on
 the ends of projecting reinforcement.
 The Contractor shall have the option to submit for approval by the Engineer a "pump" mix
 design formula of the concrete mixture to be used with the specific pumping equipment. The
 concrete mixture shall meet the specific requirements of paragraph entitled "Proportioning" for air
 content, cement factor and slump for the various classes of concrete specified.
 
 601.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Portland Cement Concrete" will be measured as
 provided for in the Specifications and/or Special Provisions for the particular item or items under
 which it is paid.
 
 601.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. "Portland Cement Concrete,” complete in place and fully accepted,
 will be paid for as provided in the Specifications covering the particular use. Any Portland cement
 concrete not otherwise provided for will be paid for under the item of concrete masonry of the class
 indicated and required. These payments shall constitute full compensation for furnishing all labor,
 materials, equipment, tools, and incidentals to produce, place, and protect the concrete as herein
 specified, in addition to any requirements in the Specifications for the particular use, except that
 a reduction in payment will be made for each Lot of Concrete not fully accepted. This reduction
 in payment for each Lot will be determined by multiplying the price of the various classes of
 
 6-25
 
 concrete per cubic yard, by the pay factor determined in Subsection 601.03.7; Testing of
 Concrete.
 
 SECTION 602
 MINERAL ADDITIVES FOR PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 
 602.01 DESCRIPTION. This Specification covers the requirements for either partial replacement
 of Portland cement with a mineral additive or as an addition to the minimum specified cement
 factor. Concrete containing mineral additives shall conform to the applicable requirements of
 SECTION 601; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE, of these Specifications together with the
 additional provisions set forth below.
 
 602.02 MATERIALS. All material components shall conform to the applicable requirements of
 SECTION M.02 of these Specifications and shall also be included on the Department's Approved
 Materials List.
 602.02.1 Mix Design and Approval Process. The mix design and approval process of the
 Portland cement concrete containing mineral additives shall conform to the provisions of
 Subsection 601.03.1 of these Specifications. Some adjustments in yield will have to be made in
 the mix design to compensate for the different specific gravity of the mineral additive. The
 water/cement ratio shall be based on a combined weight of Portland cement and the weight of the
 mineral additive.
 
 602.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS. Construction methods shall conform to Subsection 601.03
 of these Specifications except as otherwise provided herein.
 The Contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Compliance from the manufacturer certifying
 that the mineral additive being supplied conforms to the chemical and physical requirements as
 specified by the Department.
 No mineral additives shall be added to the concrete at the construction site.
 Mineral additives replacement quantities or additions other than those herein specified, shall
 not be allowed unless specifically called for on the Contract Documents or as authorized by the
 Engineer.
 Separate storage silos will be made available for each mineral additive and they shall be
 protected from rain and moisture. Unless otherwise noted, mineral additives shall be handled in
 the same manner as Portland cement.
 All storage silos shall be completely empty and clean before any mineral additive is
 deposited therein unless the silo contains a mineral additive of the same type.
 
 6-26

 or a combination of the following methods.
 1. Method A - Wave Equation Analysis. The ultimate bearing capacity of piles with
 design loads of less than or equal to 50 tons shall be determined by using a wave equation
 analysis prepared by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer. Unless otherwise stated
 in the Special Provisions, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the wave equation
 analysis. The results of the analysis, driving system specifications and data, and the proposed
 driving criteria shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Engineer for approval. Project test
 boring logs shall be provided in the Plans or otherwise made available to the Contractor for his
 use in preparing the analysis.
 Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall perform a separate wave equation
 analysis for each design pile type, load and length shown in the Plans, and for each driving
 system the Contractor proposes for use. The analysis shall take into account the proposed
 hammer assembly, pile cap, blocks, and cushion characteristics, pile properties and estimated
 lengths, and anticipated soil properties. Pile driving equipment properties shall be as
 recommended or provided by the manufacturer of such materials and equipment. The design
 bearing capacity of a pile shall be 0.364 of the calculated ultimate bearing capacity as determined
 by a wave equation analysis alone. The analysis may, at the discretion of the Engineer, be used
 to establish design capacities of greater than 50 tons if similar piles have been installed in similar
 soil conditions in close proximity to the site.
 
 8-12
 
 2. Method B - Wave Equation Analysis Calibrated With Dynamic Pile Tests. When
 specified in the Contract, the Contractor shall perform a wave equation analysis and conduct
 dynamic load testing for each design pile type, load, and length, and proposed driving system.
 The Contractor shall retain or employ a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer to
 perform, supervise, and interpret the analysis and dynamic measurements. The results of the
 dynamic load test, the wave equation analysis results, and proposed ultimate pile capacity shall
 be submitted to the Engineer for approval.
 Wave equation analyses calibrated with dynamic pile load test measurements may be
 used to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of piles with design loads of equal to or less than
 50 tons.
 At the discretion of the Engineer, this method may be used to establish design capacities
 of greater than 50 tons if similar piles have been installed in similar soil conditions in close
 proximity to the project site. The design bearing capacity of a pile shall be 0.444 of the ultimate
 bearing capacity determined from a wave equation which has been calibrated to the results of a
 dynamic pile load test.
 The Contractor shall furnish and maintain in working order all force or stain transducers,
 acceleration-velocity-or-displacement transducers, transmission cables, and appropriate
 instrumentation for recording, reducing, and displaying the dynamic testing data. The Contractor
 shall furnish the electrical power required. Field generators shall be equipped with functioning
 meters for monitoring voltage and frequency. The Contractor shall also provide temporary shelter
 of adequate size to protect the dynamic test equipment from the elements.
 (a) General Procedures for Wave Equation Analysis Calibrated with Dynamic Pile
 Tests.
 (1) Pretest Pile Calibration. For timber and concrete piles, the Contractor shall initially
 determine strain wave speed for each pile to be dynamically tested during driving. Initial wave
 speed determination shall not be required for steel piles. The pile shall be supported horizontally
 above the ground, clear of other piling or obstructions, and its length measured and recorded.
 An accelerometer shall be securely attached to one end of the pile (bolted, glued, or welded).
 The Contractor shall provide and affix an impact cushion at the pile head as directed by the
 Engineer. A sledge hammer or other suitable weight shall be used to strike the end of the pile.
 The accelerometer signal shall be recorded and displayed, and the time between acceleration
 peaks measured for as many cycles as deemed necessary by the Engineer. The first impact
 should not be counted. The wave speed for the particular pile shall be calculated as the time
 divided by the corresponding travel length of the strain waves during the time interval.
 (2) Prior to Driving. The Contractor shall furnish and attach transducers to the pile or
 provide access to the pile for the Engineer to attach instruments. Transducers shall be capable
 of independently measuring strain and acceleration verses time at a specific location along the
 pile axis during driving impact. A minimum of two, each, of strain and acceleration transducers
 shall be attached to the pile at the locations specified or directed by the Engineer. For mandrel
 driven piles, the mandrel may be instrumented similarly to a driven pile.
 At any point along the length of the pile as specified or directed by the Engineer, a
 minimum of two, each, of strain and acceleration transducers shall be attached to the pile face
 or web as the case may be. Transducers shall be located at equal radial or cross-sectional
 distances on diametrically opposite sides of piles. They shall be located the same axial distance
 8-13
 
 804.03.9 Determination of Bearing Capacity (continued).
 from the bottom of the pile, and when near the upper end, they shall be attached at least 1½ pile
 diameters below the pile head. The Contractor shall align and protect the transmission cables
 to suit his method of operation but maintain the operation of the equipment during driving.
 (3) Driving. The test pile shall be clearly marked at appropriate intervals throughout its
 length. The pile shall be positioned and aligned in the leads such that hammer impact is applied
 axially and concentrically with the pile. The Contractor shall drive the test pile to the depth at
 which the dynamic test equipment indicates that the design bearing capacity indicated on the
 Plans or specified in the Special Provisions has been achieved, unless otherwise directed by the
 Engineer. If upon further driving test piles "break through" after attaining the design bearing
 capacity, at the discretion of the Engineer, the Contractor shall further advance piles until the
 required bearing capacity is again indicated. The Contractor shall adjust the driving energy to
 maintain acceptable stresses in the pile, and shall realign the driving system if the testing
 equipment indicates that hammer impact is not delivered axially to the pile.
 The Contractor shall monitor and record: ram travel length, bounce chamber pressure,
 and/or steam or air pressure at the inlet to the hammer as appropriate for the driving system
 used, and a record of blow counts for specific intervals of penetration during driving of test piles.
 Dynamic force and velocity measurements for a specific penetration shall be taken for the
 impacts during the specified intervals to be monitored and for routine observations of penetration
 resistance as the Engineer may direct. Properties shall be determined from the specified
 minimum number of impact records during initial driving, and from representative blows at the
 beginning of any restriking. As specified or directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall delay
 restriking a sufficient period of time after the end of initial driving to allow pore water pressure and
 soil strength changes to occur. The maximum amount of penetration or maximum total number
 of blows on restrike shall be as specified or directed by the Engineer. Pile capacity shall be
 determined from the results of the dynamic testing and wave equation analysis, and submitted
 to the Engineer for approval.
 3. Method C - Static Pile Load Tests. When the design capacity of piles is greater than
 50 tons, or as otherwise specified in the Contract, the driving criteria and ultimate load capacity
 shall be established for each pile type and capacity following procedures set forth in ASTM
 D1143, "Piles Under Static Axial Compressive Load,” using the quick load compression test,
 except that the test shall be taken to plunging failure, or three times the design load, or 1,000
 tons, whichever first occurs. Testing equipment and measuring systems shall conform to ASTM
 D1143 or as specified in the Special Provisions. Telltales and/or elastic strain gauges,
 appropriately sheathed, shall be installed in or along piles at the intervals specified, and vertical
 movements or incremental strain measurements shall be monitored. Dial gauges capable of
 reading increments of 0.001-inch shall be calibrated and used to monitor relative movements or
 strains at the pile tip, head, or specified interval along the pile length.
 The Contractor shall submit for the Engineer's approval, a wave equation analysis for each
 type and capacity of pile to be tested, and, detailed plans of the proposed pile load test apparatus,
 including load frame and reference members, load cell or jacking apparatus, reaction system, and
 proposed method and intervals for telltale installation and protection. The wave equation analysis
 and pile load test plans shall be prepared by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer,
 retained or employed by the Contractor. The load test apparatus shall be designed and
 8-14
 
 constructed to allow the various load increments to be placed gradually without causing vibration
 to the pile. The wave equation analyses shall demonstrate that piles will not be damaged during
 driving and shall determine the blow count necessary to achieve the required ultimate static
 capacities. The driving criteria proposed by the Contractor shall be subject to review and
 approval by the Engineer.
 The design bearing capacity shall be defined as 50 percent of the failure load. The failure
 load of a pile under axial compressive load is that load which produces a settlement of the pile
 head at failure equal to:
 Sr = S + (0.15 + 0.008D), where
 Sr = Settlement at failure, in inches;
 D = Pile Diameter or Width, in inches;
 S = Elastic Deformation of total unsupported pile length, in inches;
 Piles to be utilized for load tests shall be manufactured or furnished with telltales and
 protective sleeves incorporated into or along the length of the pile as specified in the Plans or
 Special Provisions. The Contractor shall submit his proposed telltale design and method of
 installation to the Engineer for approval prior to manufacture or furnishing of piles. The telltales
 shall be suitably sleeved and protected during driving and shall be functional throughout the pile
 load test. Sleeves shall be properly secured and cast in the interior of precast or cast-in-place
 concrete piles, secured to the interior walls of steel pipe piles, or affixed to the faces of steel pipe,
 timber and precast piles or the web of H-section piles as shown on the Plans.
 Telltales shall consist of solid, flush-joint sections of steel rods, which shall extend to and
 screw into threaded steel mounts affixed to or cast into the pile at the specified points along the
 pile length. Telltale sleeves shall be plastic or steel tubing as specified, and shall be properly
 aligned, installed and affixed to the screw mounts to the extent that tell tale rods can be lowered
 into the sleeves entirely under their own weight. Where permitted by the dimensions of the test
 pile, the Contractor may choose to protect the tubes by installing them inside steel or PVC pipe.
 Sleeves and rods shall be furnished with end caps and otherwise suitably protected during
 driving of piles. Prior to installation of the telltale rods, sleeves shall be filled with a sufficient
 quantity of oil or grease to fully occupy the annular space between the sleeve and the rod.
 Telltale rods shall be installed into sleeves under the inspection of the Engineer. Any telltale rod
 installed without the Engineer's inspection shall be removed, measured, and re-inserted under
 the inspection of the Engineer.
 The number and location of test piles shall be as shown in the Plans or specified in the
 Special Provisions, or as directed by the Engineer. Load test piles shall be driven to the minimum
 tip elevations and to the driving criteria determined based upon the wave equation analysis. The
 elevation of the top of the test pile shall be determined immediately after driving, after driving
 anchor piles, and just before load testing to determine heave. Any test pile which has heaved
 more than 1/4-inch shall be redriven or jacked to the original tip elevation prior to load testing.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, a minimum three-day waiting period shall
 be observed between the driving of any anchor piles or the load test pile, and the commencement
 of the pile load test.
 
 8-15
 
 The Contractor shall exercise care to prevent eccentric loading of the pile. If the test fails
 due to eccentric loading, no payment shall be made for the test and no future test shall be
 performed on the eccentrically loaded pile.
 When the approved test method requires the use of tension (anchor) piles which will later
 be used as permanent piles in the work, such tension piles will be of the same type and diameter
 as the production piles and shall be driven in the location of the permanent piles.
 The "Boot Strap" method shall be performed by jacking down on the test pile or piles with
 a calibrated hydraulic jack placed beneath a girder. The girder shall be anchored to tension piles
 located at least 6 feet from the test pile or piles. In no case shall piles closer than 6-feet from the
 test pile or piles be used to assist in anchoring the girder. Connections of the girder to the
 anchors and hydraulic jack shall be tight when the test is commenced and the jack shall be
 capable of moving the test pile or piles a vertical distance of at least 5 inches during the test.
 If the load is applied to the test pile or piles by jacking against a dead load, such dead load
 shall not have supports closer than 6 feet from the test pile or piles. The jack shall be capable
 of moving the test pile or piles a vertical distance of 5 inches.
 The Contractor shall have a qualified employee present at all times during the
 performance of the test to maintain the required load. If the test is stopped before completion and
 the load wholly or partially removed from the pile or piles due to defects in the jack, yield of
 connections, insufficient load or travel capacity of the jack, or for other mechanical reasons, the
 Engineer shall order the load test abandoned and replaced by a new test to be conducted on
 another pile or piles at an adjacent location. Where a loading test is abandoned because of
 reasons for which the Contractor is responsible, there shall be no payment for such an abandoned test.
 804.03.10 Pile Driving Equipment.
 a. General - Approval of Driving System. All pile driving equipment, including the
 hammer, hammer cushion, drive head, pile cushion, and other appurtenances to be furnished by
 the Contractor shall be approved in advance by the Engineer prior to beginning work. The
 Contractor shall submit a description of his proposed equipment a minimum of two weeks before
 starting work. Whenever the bearing capacity of piles is specified to be determined by a wave
 equation analysis, the Contractor shall submit calculations based upon the wave equation
 analysis (WEAP or other equivalent analysis) which shall demonstrate that the piles can be driven
 to the ordered length with a reasonable driving energy without damage to the piles. In the
 absence of other supporting data, the following hammer efficiencies shall be used in the analysis:
 Hammer Type
 Single-Acting, Air/Steam
 Double-Acting, Air/Steam
 Diesel
 
 Efficiency, Percent
 67
 50
 72
 
 The Contractor's proposed driving equipment shall be evaluated based upon the required
 number of hammer blows per inch of pile penetration and the pile stresses at the required
 ultimate pile capacity. The required number of hammer blows indicated by the calculations for
 8-16
 
 the required bearing capacity shall be between 4 and 10 blows per inch in order for the equipment
 to be considered acceptable.
 In addition, for the driving equipment to be considered acceptable, calculated pile stresses
 corresponding to the driving criteria and required pile capacity shall be less than the stress level
 that will result in damage to the pile. For steel piles compressive driving stresses shall not
 exceed 90 percent of the yield point (0.9 Fy) of the pile. For concrete piles, tensile stresses shall
 not exceed 3 times the square root of the concrete compressive strength, f'c, of the pile plus the
 effective prestress value, i.e., [3 x (f'c)½ + prestress]. Compressive stresses in concrete piles
 shall not exceed 85 percent of the concrete compressive strength minus the effective prestress:
 (0.85 f'c - prestress). For timber piles, compressive stresses shall not exceed 3 times the
 allowable static design strength listed in the Plans.
 During pile driving operations, the Contractor shall use the approved driving system. Any
 change in the driving system or equipment will be considered only after the Contractor has
 submitted revised pile driving equipment data and calculations for corresponding driving criteria
 and pile stresses.
 The Engineer's approval of the pile driving equipment shall not relieve the Contractor of
 his responsibility to drive piles, free of damage, to the required bearing and tip elevations shown
 on the Plans or specified in the Special Provisions.
 b. Hammers. Piles may be driven with drop hammers; single-, double- or differentialaction compressed air or steam operated hammers, diesel hammers conforming to these
 Specifications. Vibratory or other pile driving methods may be used only when specifically
 authorized by the Engineer or allowed in the Special Provisions. Hammers shall be selected to
 suit the conditions to be encountered. If the selected hammer used is found to be unsatisfactory,
 it shall be replaced with a larger or smaller hammer of the same type or an alternate hammer
 type.
 1. Gravity or Drop Hammers. Gravity or drop hammers may be used for driving timber
 piles, but shall not be used for precast concrete piles or for piles with design capacities greater
 than 30 tons. When gravity hammers are allowed, the ram weight shall be at least equivalent to
 the combined weight of the drive cap and the pile. In no case shall the ram weight be less than
 3,000 pounds, and the fall height shall not exceed 12 feet. All drop hammers shall be equipped
 with hammer guides to insure concentric impact on the drive head or pile cushion.
 In general energy developed by the hammer shall be at least one foot-pound for each
 pound of weight of the pile or casing being driven, but in no case shall it be less than 8,000 footpounds energy per blow.
 2. Air- or Steam-Operated Hammers. The weight of the striking part of air- or steamoperated hammers shall not be less than 1/3 of the combined weight of the pile and drive cap,
 and in no case shall the striking part weigh less than 2,750 pounds.
 Steam or air hammers to drive timber piles less than 50 feet in length shall develop not
 less than 8,000 foot-pounds of energy per blow; for timber piles 50 feet or greater in length, not
 less than 15,000 foot-pounds of energy per blow. Unless otherwise specified, hammers used
 for driving precast concrete piles, metal shells, steel H-section or pipe piles, shall develop not less
 than 15,000 foot-pounds of energy per blow.
 8-17
 
 The plant and equipment furnished shall have sufficient capacity to maintain, under
 working conditions, the pressure at the hammer as specified by the manufacturer. Boilers and
 compressors shall be equipped with accurate pressure gauges and a second gauge shall be
 applied at the hammer intake, unless other methods of determining hammer efficiency are
 authorized.
 3. Diesel Hammers. Open-end (single-acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with
 a device to permit the Engineer to determine hammer stroke at all times during pile driving
 operations. Closed-end (double-acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with a bounce
 chamber pressure gauge, in good working order, mounted near ground level so that it can be
 easily read. A correlation chart of bounce chamber pressure and delivered hammer energy shall
 be provided by the Contractor.
 4. Vibratory Pile Drivers. Vibratory pile drivers may be used, subject to the Engineer's
 approval, provided that sufficient correlated data is developed and furnished to permit a
 satisfactory evaluation of pile load-carrying capacity and performance. These characteristics
 shall be established by direct comparison with the penetration and performance of the same
 type(s) of pile, driven with conventional impact hammers under similar conditions and in
 corresponding locations.
 A number of length determination piles as ordered by the Engineer shall be driven using
 a conventional hammer to determine with reasonable accuracy the depth of acceptable
 penetration throughout the area of each foundation or trestle bent. Subsequent piles to be driven
 using the accepted alternative method shall be driven to corresponding depths of penetration with
 minor adjustments if driving conditions change.
 A representative number of such piles as designated by the Engineer shall be load tested
 to the required capacity, along with a corresponding number of those piles driven using the
 alternative method and equipment. Load test data shall be carefully recorded and correlated.
 A sufficient number of load tests shall be performed on piles driven using the alternative method
 as required to verify the results and insure design capacity.
 No payments will be made to the Contractor for pile load tests in excess of those which
 would be required for piles driven by conventional methods, unless field conditions are such that
 the alternative methods must be used to advance piles. In such cases, such additional load tests
 will be measured for payment provided the Engineer has ordered the tests in writing, and the
 tests are carried to completion.
 804.03.11 Driving Appurtenances.
 a. Hammer Cushions. All impact driving equipment except gravity hammers shall be
 equipped with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the pile or
 hammer and to insure uniform driving behavior. Hammer cushions shall be made of durable
 manufactured materials which will retain uniform properties during driving. Wood, wire rope, and
 asbestos hammer cushions shall not be permitted. A striker plate shall be placed on the hammer
 cushion to insure uniform compression of the cushion material. The hammer cushion will be
 inspected by the Engineer prior to beginning pile driving and after each 100 hours of pile driving.
 The Contractor shall replace the hammer cushion when there has occurred a thickness reduction
 of 25 percent of the original cushion thickness.
 
 8-18
 
 b. Pile Drive Head. Piles driven with impact hammers shall be fitted with an adequate
 drive head to distribute the hammer blow to the pile head. The drive head shall be axially aligned
 with the hammer and pile. The drive head shall be guided by leads and shall not be free
 swinging. The drive head shall fit around the pile in such a manner as to prevent transfer of
 torsional forces during driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.
 For steel and timber piles, the pile shall be cut off square and a drive head provided to
 hold the pile in line with the axis of the hammer. For precast and precast-prestressed concrete
 piles, the pile head shall be plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent
 eccentric impacts from the drive head. For special pile types, appropriate drive heads, mandrels,
 or other devices shall be provided so that piles can be driven without damage.
 c. Pile Cushion. Concrete piles shall be protected by a pile cushion when the nature of
 driving is such as to unduly injure the piles. Where plywood is used, a minimum of 4 inches shall
 be placed on the pile head prior to driving. A new cushion shall be placed when the initial cushion
 is compressed to one-half its original thickness, or when the cushion begins to burn. The pile
 cushion dimensions shall be such that the hammer energy is uniformly distributed to the pile
 head.
 d. Leads. Pile driving leads shall be used throughout the pile driving operation and shall
 support the pile and hammer in proper positions. Leads shall be constructed in a manner that
 affords freedom of movement of the hammer while maintaining alignment of the hammer and pile
 to insure concentric impact for each blow. The leads shall be of sufficient length to make the
 need for a follower unnecessary, and shall be designed to permit proper alignment of batter piles.
 e. Followers. Followers shall only be used when specifically allowed in the Special
 Provisions or authorized in writing by the Engineer. When permitted, the first pile in every bent
 and the tenth pile driven thereafter shall be furnished sufficiently long and driven full length
 without a follower to verify that adequate pile penetration is being attained to develop the required
 capacity for those piles driven using a follower.
 The follower and pile shall be held and maintained in equal and proper alignment during
 driving. The follower shall be of such material and dimensions to permit piles to be driven to the
 length determined to be necessary from the driving of the full length piles without a follower. The
 final position and alignment of the first two piles installed with followers in each substructure unit
 shall be verified to be in accordance with the location tolerances specified herein before additional
 piles are installed.
 804.03.12 Preparation for Driving.
 a. Preconstruction Survey and Vibration Monitoring. Unless otherwise specified in
 the Special Provisions, a preconstruction survey of any structure within 200 feet of pile driving
 shall be performed by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer employed or retained
 by the Contractor and submitted to the Engineer prior to beginning work. The survey shall
 document the existing pre-construction condition of structures such that potential impacts due to
 pile driving can be assessed.
 During pile driving the Contractor shall monitor vibrations at structures within 200 feet of
 pile driving using a seismograph capable of measuring vibration accelerations, velocities, and
 amplitudes in three mutually perpendicular directions. The vibration monitoring shall be
 8-19
 
 performed under the direction of a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer. The
 Contractor shall adjust his pile driving operations to limit construction vibration peak particle
 velocities to 1 inch per second, unless a lower limit is warranted based on the preconstruction
 survey. Daily summaries of peak particle velocities and vibration records shall be submitted to
 the Engineer on a weekly basis.
 b. Layout and Elevation and Location Control. Unless otherwise specified in the
 Plans or Special Provisions, the Contractor shall be responsible for layout of all pile locations
 using offsets from the project baselines. The Contractor shall establish ground surface elevation
 at the proposed driving locations to the nearest 0.1-foot, referenced to the project elevation
 datum. The Contractor shall set tideboards as needed and as specified in the Plans or Special
 Provisions when driving piles on water. Mudline elevations shall be determined at each pile
 location on water prior to starting driving.
 The Contractor shall verify the tip elevation of driven piles to the nearest 0.01-foot relative
 to the project elevation datum. Where foundation or trestle piles are driven in groups, or where
 piles are to be restruck, the Contractor shall check each pile tip elevation prior to and after
 restriking as required by the Engineer.
 c. Excavations and Sheeting. In general, piles shall not be driven until after excavations
 are completed. Any material forced up between or around piles as a result of driving shall be
 removed to the correct elevation and that surface densified before any foundation concrete is
 placed.
 Where sheeting or cofferdams are to be constructed, and piles will be driven within
 sheeting alignments, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the Contractor shall
 submit his proposed sequence of operations for the Engineer's approval prior to beginning any
 driving of sheeting or piles. The Contractor shall use those methods such that sheeting
 installation shall not interfere with, obstruct, damage or otherwise impact the function of bearing
 piles.
 d. Preboring. When required by the Special Provisions or as shown in the Plans, the
 Contractor shall prebore holes at pile locations to the depths shown on the Plans, specified in the
 Special Provisions, or authorized by the Engineer. Prebored holes shall generally smaller in
 diameter than the diameter or diagonal of the cross section of the pile, except in the case where
 preboring is specified where driving vibrations are not permissible. Preboring shall be of sufficient
 depth to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface obstructions are
 encountered, the hole diameter may be increased to the least dimension which is adequate for
 pile installation. Any void space remaining around the pile after completion of driving or other
 installation, shall be filled with sand or other approved material. The use of spuds to make a hole
 for inserting a pile shall not be permitted in lieu of preboring, unless specifically allowed in the
 Special Provisions or authorized in writing by the Engineer.
 Piles to be driven through newly constructed embankments shall be driven in holes drilled
 or spudded through the embankment when the embankment is in excess of 5 feet in height. The
 hole shall have a diameter of not less than the greatest dimension of the pile cross section plus
 6 inches. After driving the pile, the space around the pile shall be filled to the surface of the
 embankment with dry sand or fine gravel. Material resulting from drilling holes shall be disposed
 of as approved by the Engineer.
 
 8-20
 
 e. Templates and Support Spuds. The Contractor shall furnish and fabricate templates
 as he deems necessary to align and maintain piles at their proper location, alignment, or batter
 throughout driving. Such templates shall be securely fixed using such temporary spud piles or
 other appropriate bracing at the option of the Contractor. Template configurations and support
 piles shall be situated so as not to injure or displace driven piles nor interfere with pile driving or
 other portions of the work. The Contractor shall maintain templates in place after initial driving
 and until restriking has been completed. The Contractor shall dismantle and remove templates
 and temporary supports or piles so as not to damage, or misalign completed production piling.
 Templates and support piles shall remain the property of the Contractor, and no separate
 payment shall be made for furnishing materials or labor to construct templates or for support
 piles.
 f. Measurement and Marking of Piles. The Contractor shall measure the total length
 of each pile to be driven, and shall clearly mark each pile in the increments and using the marking
 material specified in the Plans, the Special Provisions, or as directed by the Engineer. The
 Contractor shall notify the Engineer of the total measured length of each pile and shall allow the
 Engineer time to verify the length and to approve the pile marking prior to placing piles in the
 leads for driving.
 During driving, the Contractor shall provide such markings on the leads or shall provide
 a graduated gauge which shall be clearly marked and situated at ground level to allow verification
 of the final driving resistance for each pile driven.
 g. Jetting. Water jetting shall not be permitted unless specifically allowed in the Special
 Provisions, or authorized in writing by the Engineer. When water jetting is used, the Contractor
 shall determine the number of jets and volume and pressure at the jet nozzles, which are
 sufficient to freely erode material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the
 final in-place pile. The Contractor shall be responsible for restoring or repairing all damage to the
 site resulting from jetting. When jetting is specifically required in the Special Provisions, the plant
 shall have sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch at
 two, 3/4-inch jet nozzles. Whether specified or approved by the Engineer, jetting shall be ceased
 and the jets removed when the pile tip is at a minimum of 5 feet above the required tip elevation.
 The pile shall then be driven by impact hammer to the required tip elevation and bearing capacity.
 The Contractor shall control, treat as necessary, construct and maintain appropriate settlement
 basins, and legally dispose of sediments and expended jetting water as specified in the Special
 Provisions or as approved by the Engineer.
 804.03.13 Driving Piles.
 a. Pile Driving Records. The Contractor shall keep records for each pile driven of the
 number of blows required for each foot of penetration for the entire pile and penetration under the
 final series of blows (blows per inch for a minimum of the last 12 inches of driving). The records
 shall include the type and size of hammer used, rate of hammer operation, type and dimensions
 of driving helmet and cushion block. The records shall include the date, starting time, total driving
 time, pile location and identification number, pile type and size, ground elevation from which the
 pile is driven, and final elevation of the pile tip and butt. The records shall also indicate the
 quantity of concrete which may be placed in the pile.
 b. General. Driving shall in general conform to the following procedure: in order to offset
 the progressive consolidation effect of pile grouping, where underground utilities are located in
 the immediate vicinity, the first pile driven shall be the one nearest the utility.
 8-21
 
 If, in the opinion of the Engineer, conditions during driving indicate that resistance is due
 to an obstruction, the Contractor shall employ adequate methods to drive the pile through the
 obstruction or he shall remove the obstruction. In the event that the Engineer agrees that the
 obstruction cannot be economically removed, the Contractor shall be allowed the option of driving
 an alternative pile (or piles) at a location designated by the Engineer. The initial pile shall be
 removed or cut off as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall be paid for the alternate pile
 or piles at Contract unit prices. However there shall be no payment for the initial pile or for any
 costs of attempting to remove the obstruction. The Contractor shall have no claim for delay if this
 contingency should arise and no claim for moving his equipment to and from the pile location.
 c. Driving Test Piles. When specified in the Special Provisions, preliminary test piles
 and piles designated for dynamic or static load tests shall be driven at the locations and to the
 depths directed by the Engineer, before other production piles are ordered or driven in the area
 represented by the test. All test piles shall be driven with equipment identical to that which the
 Contractor proposes to use for production piles.
 Test piles shall be driven to a hammer blow count established by the Engineer at the
 estimated tip elevation. Test piles which do not attain the specified hammer blow count at a
 depth of 1 foot above the estimated tip elevation shall be allowed to set up for a period
 determined by the Engineer before being redriven. If possible, the hammer shall be warmed up
 before redriving begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. If the specified hammer
 blow count is not attained upon redriving, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to drive a
 portion or all of the remaining pile length and repeat the set up and redrive procedure. When
 ordered by the Engineer, test piles driven to plan tip elevation without attaining the required
 hammer blow count, shall be spliced and driven until the required blow count is attained.
 d. Utilization of Preliminary Test Piles and Loaded Test Piles. After the completion
 of loading tests, loaded test piles may be utilized in the permanent structure if found satisfactory
 for such use. Preliminary test piles driven to the required capacities may similarly be utilized in
 the permanent structure. Loaded test piles or preliminary piles determined not suitable for use
 in the permanent structure shall be removed, or cut off below ground and below base-of-footing
 or pile cap elevation, or disposed of in any other manner, all as directed by the Engineer.
 e. Penetration of Piles. All piles shall be driven to a penetration such that the minimum
 pile tip elevation is attained, and such that the pile bearing value, determined as specified herein,
 is not less than that indicated on the Plans.
 Piles located offshore, alongshore, in stream beds or along stream banks shall be driven
 to such penetration as the Engineer deems necessary for protection from scour.
 If, after a test pile or production pile is driven through and below a hard stratum, the
 bearing value of the pile drops below the capacity required on the Plans, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to drive permanent piles through the hard stratum to a penetration at which
 the required capacity is again attained.
 When production friction piles fail to achieve design bearing capacities after driving the
 full finished lengths, these piles, when approved by the Engineer, can be left for a minimum of
 24 hours to allow soil setup before attempting to splice. After the waiting period has passed, the
 Contractor shall redrive one representative pile in each pile group to check the gain in bearing
 8-22
 
 upon soil setup. The soil setup bearing shall be based upon the number of redriving blows
 necessary to drive the pile an additional 3 inches. These piles may be accepted without splicing
 if they exhibit the required bearing capacities upon redriving.
 f. Driven Pile Location and Alignment Tolerances. All piles shall be driven at the
 locations and alignments shown on the Plans unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. Piles
 shall be driven to within an axial tolerance not to exceed 1/4-inch per foot variation from the
 vertical or from the design batter orientation. Piles for trestle bents shall be driven such that the
 bent cap may be constructed in its design location without inducing excessive stresses in the
 piles. The final position of the axial center of driven foundation piles, measured in the plane of
 the cut-off elevation, shall not deviate from the design location by more than 6 inches or 1/4 of
 their diameter, whichever is greater, provided that:
 1. The average deviation along a line of piles in any direction within the bent shall not
 exceed 3 inches from the line through the pile center locations shown on the Plans; and,
 2. The nearest edge of any pile shall not be closer than 9 inches from the design position
 of the edge of footing or pile bent cap; and,
 3. The minimum distance between the centers of any two adjacent piles is not less than
 24 inches at the cut-off elevation.
 4. The center of gravity of the pile group at any trestle bent or foundation as calculated
 at the cut-off elevation, shall not exceed the tolerances specified in the Plans or Special
 Provisions for that pile group.
 If the location of any pile exceeds these tolerances, then it shall be the Contractor's
 responsibility to provide appropriate calculations to show the center of gravity of the pile group
 at the cut-off elevation as driven. Should the center of gravity of any pile group exceed the limits
 specified, or otherwise presented in the Plans or Special Provisions, it shall be the Contractor's
 responsibility to submit a detailed remedy, including all relevant engineering calculations, for
 review and approval by the Engineer. The Contractor shall further be responsible for performing
 the approved corrective action, including replacement of misaligned piles and/or furnishing
 materials and constructing any required increase in footing dimensions, at no additional cost to
 the State.
 Manipulation of piles after driving in order to force them into proper position will not be
 permitted; the Contractor shall remove, or if space allows and as allowed by the Engineer, cut off
 misdriven piles, and then redrive or replace mislocated piles to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 g. Pile Heave and Restriking. The top elevation of each pile head shall be determined
 immediately after driving and again after completion of the driving of all piles within any
 foundation or trestle pile group. Any pile which heaves more than 1/4-inch, or otherwise specified
 in the Special Provisions shall be redriven to the design tip elevation and to the required driving
 resistance.
 For concrete-filled piles, the Contractor shall restrike heaved shells or steel pipe piles prior
 to placing concrete in any pile within that pile group which has not evidenced heave.
 
 8-23
 
 804.03.14 Defective, Damaged or Broken Piles. The Contractor's driving operations and
 procedures shall not subject piles to excessive or undue injury or stresses producing spalling and
 crushing of concrete; splitting, splintering or brooming of timber piles; or splitting or excessive
 deformation of steel piles and shells. Any pile damaged by reason of internal defects, improper
 driving, driven out of position or driven below the butt elevation indicated on the Plans or as
 authorized by the Engineer, shall be corrected by the Contractor by one of the following methods
 as approved by the Engineer:
 a. The pile shall be withdrawn and replaced by a new, and if necessary, longer pile;
 b. The defective or low pile shall be cut off below base-of-footing elevation, and a second
 pile shall be driven adjacent to the defective or low pile.
 c. The pile shall be spliced or otherwise built-up as provided for herein, or, the footing
 shall be sufficiently extended and reinforced to properly embed the pile.
 Any and all such remedial materials and work shall be provided and performed by the
 Contractor at no additional expense to the State.
 804.03.15 Pile Dewatering, Cleanout, and Spoil/Water Containment and Disposal. The
 Contractor shall remove soil materials, debris and/or accumulated water from driven steel pipe
 piles and metal shell piles to the satisfaction of the Engineer to allow inspection of pile interiors
 and prior to placement of any concrete. The Contractor shall provide for the control, containment,
 separation of sediments, and legal disposal of sediments and water volumes removed from such
 piles. The Contractor shall further be responsible to restore or repair any damage to the site
 incurred by dewatering and cleanout of piles. This work shall be considered included and integral
 to the installation of these pile types. No separate measurement or payment shall be made for
 this work.
 804.03.16 Pile Cut-offs. Piles shall not be cut off until all piles within a pile group or within the
 area specified have been checked for heave and any required restriking or redriving has been
 completed.
 Unless otherwise specified, all piles shall be cut off perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
 of the pile at the elevations specified in the Plans. Piles which support timber caps or grillages
 shall be sawed or otherwise cut off to conform to the plane of the bottom of the superimposed
 structure. In all cases, the amount of cut-off length shall be sufficient to remove any portion of
 the pile top which has been trimmed for driving, bruised, or otherwise deformed or damaged
 during driving. Cut-off piles shall be anchored to the structure, or otherwise protected as
 specified until incorporated into the remainder of the work.
 The cut-off portions of all piles including test piles shall be retained and made available
 for use in splicing or building up piles as required until the pile driving is complete. Upon
 completion of the work, piling cut-off lengths shall become the property of the Contractor and
 shall be legally disposed of off-site at the Contractor's expense.
 Cut-off pile heads, cuts for bracing, and exposed abrasions of treated timber piles shall
 be trimmed and then given field coatings of preservatives as specified in the Special Provisions.
 Predrilled bolt holes shall be impregnated with the approved field preservative. If treated holes
 will remain open, field-treated wood plugs or other temporary plugs approved by the Engineer
 shall be installed in the holes.
 8-24
 
 Where specified, after trimming and applying the approved field preservative, a sheet of
 three-ply roofing felt, or a sheet of galvanized iron, not lighter than 24 gauge, and of sufficient
 area to project at least 6 inches outside and completely around the pile head, shall be bent down
 over the top of the pile to fit tightly around the pile. The edges of this cover shall trimmed and
 fastened securely to the pile face with large-headed galvanized roofing nails or by being bound
 with galvanized wire.
 The tops and faces of precast concrete piles which are to be embedded in the structure
 shall be cleaned and minor chipping or spalling removed.
 Steel pipe piles and metal shells shall be cut off at the design elevation prior to
 emplacement of concrete fills. If steel pipe or shell piles are to remain unfilled, the Contractor
 shall provide and install protective caps as specified in the Plans or Special Provisions.
 804.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 804.04.1 Piles Furnished and Driven. "Timber Piles" (treated or untreated); "Precast/Prestressed Concrete Piles" (solid rectangular, cylindrical, or hollow cylindrical); "Steel Piles" (Hpiles, or pipe piles, or steel shell piles); or "Composite Piles,” to be furnished and driven, shall be

 Engineer when indicated by field conditions as specified above.
 Additional compensation shall be provided for such additional or modified temporary or
 permanent sheet piling or soldier piles-and-lagging which has been directed and/or approved by
 the Engineer.
 805.03.2 Driving Sheet Piling and Soldier Piles. When required by the Plans or Special
 Provisions, the preconstruction survey of adjacent structures shall be performed and the findings
 submitted to the Engineer for his review. No driving shall commence until the Engineer has
 approved the preconstruction survey. If required in the Plans or Special Provisions, the
 Contractor shall perform vibration monitoring during driving of sheeting or piles. The preconstruction survey and vibration monitoring work shall conform to the requirements described in
 Subsection 804.03.12; Para. a, of these Specifications.
 Sheet piling and soldier piles shall be driven reasonably true to the line and depth as
 indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. Steam, pneumatic or diesel powered
 vibratory hammers of appropriate capacity shall be used to drive all sheet piling and soldier piles.
 Any material which interrupts the driving shall be removed by the Contractor.
 Soldier piles shall be driven to the location and axial tolerances specified in Para. f of
 Subsection 804.03.13 of these Specifications, or as otherwise indicated on the Plans.
 805.03.3 Pre-drilled Soldier Pile Installation. Soldier piles shall be installed in pre-drilled or
 pre-augered holes when required by the Plans or Special Provisions, or: 1) when vibratory or
 impact driving is not permitted; or 2) when obstructions prevent driving and the Engineer
 authorizes pre-drilling or pre-augering. In the case of 2) above, standard driving shall be resumed
 when the obstruction has been removed or bypassed.
 Pre-drilled or pre-augered holes shall be of the diameter shown on the Plans and shall be
 of sufficiently large diameter such that concrete, lean concrete, or other backfill approved by the
 Engineer can be installed in the annulus between the soldier pile and the sidewalls of the drilled
 hole.
 Drilled or augered holes shall be advanced to the required depth as indicated on the Plans
 or to the depth approved by the Engineer. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to use those
 methods and equipment to maintain the sidewalls of the excavated shaft, and to completely clean
 out and remove soil materials, cuttings, and water from the shaft excavation prior to the
 installation of soldier piles and concrete backfill. Such efforts and equipment shall be considered
 as part of the work and shall not be considered for additional compensation.
 Soldier piles shall be placed into the shaft such that they do not sustain damage, and shall
 be vertically centered and aligned such that their final position when backfilled, meets the
 specified location and axial tolerances. Damaged or out-of-tolerance soldier piles which must be
 removed and reinstalled or replaced shall not be measured for payment.
 Concrete, lean concrete, or other approved backfill shall be placed in the shaft to
 completely encase the soldier pile. Concrete shall be placed from the bottom of the drilled shaft
 up to the specified elevation or ground surface. The shaft shall be dewatered before placing
 8-31
 
 concrete backfill. If during pumping excessive water inflow is encountered, the Engineer may
 require alternative methods to reduce inflow, alter the concrete mix, or approve alternative backfill
 materials.
 Concrete backfill shall cure for a minimum of 5 days before excavation and lagging
 installation begins. Equipment or other construction operations which might disturb the concrete
 shall not be allowed in the vicinity of the installed pile until the concrete has cured.
 805.03.4 Earthwork and Installation of Lagging. Excavation shall conform to the requirements
 of Subsections 202.03 or 203.03 of these Specifications. Placement and securing of lagging
 shall closely follow excavation in front of pile-and-lagging such that loss of ground is minimized.
 Lagging shall be installed horizontally between soldier piles. Excavation shall proceed only as
 required to set one row of lagging. When one row of lagging has been placed, excavation for the
 next lower row may commence.
 805.03.5 Openings and Cut-offs. The Contractor shall prepare and cut openings within the
 sheet piling or piles-and-lagging to permit the passage of all necessary utilities. Cost of
 preparation of openings for passing of utilities shall be included in the applicable unit bid price for
 sheet piling or soldier pile-and-lagging.
 Sheet piling, whether temporary or permanent, shall be cut off as necessary during
 construction to allow work to proceed. Permanent sheet piling shall be cut off in a straight line
 at the elevations indicated on the Plans.
 Soldier piles shall be cut off cleanly and horizontally at the elevations indicated on the
 Plans. Concrete backfill, lagging, and other supports shall be removed to the elevations indicated
 on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 805.03.6 Installation of Ground Anchors. The Contractor shall select the drilling method, the
 grouting procedure, and the grouting pressure to be used for the installation of the ground anchor
 as necessary to satisfy the load test requirements. The method of drilling used shall prevent loss
 of ground above the drilled hole that may be detrimental to the structure or existing structures.
 If water is used in the drilling operation, the Contractor shall be responsible for controlling and
 disposing of the water in such a manner that is not harmful to the site, environment, and adjacent
 property. Any damage caused by loss of ground or inadequate control of water shall be repaired
 immediately by the Contractor at no cost to the State.
 The hole diameter in free length shall not be less than 3 inches nor greater than 12 inches.
 The hole shall remain open until grouting begins. Casing may be necessary to maintain a clean
 open hole. Casing, if used, shall be removed as grouting progresses unless permitted by the
 Engineer to be left in place. The tendon shall be inserted into the drilled hole without difficulty.
 When the tendon cannot be completely inserted, it shall be removed and the drill hole cleaned
 or re-drilled to permit insertion of the tendon without difficulty. Partially inserted tendons shall not
 be driven or forced into the hole.
 The location, inclination, and alignment of the drilled hole shall be as shown on the Plans.
 Inclination and alignment shall be within plus-or-minus 3 degrees of the planned angle at the
 bearing plate and within plus-or-minus 12 inches of the planned location at the ground surface
 (point of entry).
 
 8-32
 
 The Engineer shall be responsible for determining the anchor bond length necessary to
 develop adequate load capacity to satisfy anchor testing acceptance criteria for the design load
 shown on the Plans. However, the drilled anchor hole shall not extend outside of the right-of-way
 limits shown on the Plans. The minimum bond length shall be 10 feet in competent rock, 15 feet
 in soil, or the minimum shown on the Plans. The anchor hole shall extend a minimum of 1 foot
 beyond the tendon length to be installed by the Contractor.
 The grouting equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. A
 positive displacement grout pump shall be equipped with a gauge to monitor and record grout
 pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or
 twice the actual grout pressures anticipated, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall
 be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be
 capable of continuously agitating the grout.
 The grout shall be injected at the lowest point of the drill hole. The hole shall be filled with
 grout progressively from the bottom to the top to prevent air voids. The grout may be pumped
 through grout tubes, casings, hollow-stem augers, or drill rods. The grout shall be placed after
 the insertion of the tendon into the drill hole. The quantity of grout and the grout pressures shall
 be recorded by the Contractor. The grout pressures and quantities shall be controlled to prevent
 heave of the ground or fracturing of rock formations.
 Except where modified below, the grout above the top of the bond length may be placed
 at the same time as the bond length grout, but it shall not be placed under pressure. The grout
 at the top of the hole shall stop a minimum of 6 inches from the back of the structure or trumpet,
 whichever is lowest. If the ground anchor is installed in fine grained soil using a drilled hole larger
 than 6 inches in diameter, then the grout above the top of the bond length shall be placed after
 the ground anchor has been successfully load tested. If the grout is placed in two stages, the
 initial stage must completely fill the hole to a point 2 feet above the bond length portion of the
 ground anchor. The entire drill hole may be grouted at the same time if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that the ground anchor system does not derive a significant portion (less than 5
 percent) of its load resistance from the soil above the bond length portion of the ground anchor.
 Upon completion of grouting, the grout tube may remain in the drill hole provided it is filled with
 grout. Also, after grouting, the tendon shall not be loaded for seven days, unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 Tendons shall be free of dirt, detrimental rust (see below), or other deleterious
 substances. Prior to installation, tendons shall be handled and stored in such a manner as to
 avoid corrosion and physical damage. Damage such as abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds, weld
 splatters, or heavy corrosion and pitting will be cause for rejection of the element. A slight rusting,
 provided it is not sufficient to cause pits visible to the unaided eye, shall not be cause for
 rejection. Rejected elements shall be replaced at no additional cost to the State in terms of either
 material replacement and/or resulting time delays. Grounding of welding leads to the tendon is
 not permitted. The bond length of the tendon shall be degreased prior to installation in the hole.
 No solvent residue shall remain on the tendon.
 Each ground anchor shall be load tested by the Contractor. No load greater than 10
 percent of the design load may be applied to the ground anchor prior to load testing. The
 stressing equipment shall be placed over the ground anchor in such a manner that the jack,
 bearing plates, load cell, and stressing anchorage are axially aligned with the tendon and the
 tendon is centered within the equipment. The test shall be simultaneously applied to the entire
 8-33
 
 tendon. During all testing, the movement of the tendon shall be recorded at each load increment
 to the nearest 0.001-inch with a dial gauge or vernier scale. Measurements shall be taken from
 a fixed reference point and shall have adequate travel clearance so that total ground anchor
 movement can be measured without resting the device. The jack load should be monitored with
 a load cell. Each load increment shall be fully applied as rapidly as possible (preferable in less
 than 30 seconds after the jack pump is started).
 When the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test load
 exceeds the jack's ram length, the procedure for recycling the jack ram must be approved by the
 Engineer. The load testing shall be proceeded by incrementally loading the ground anchor in
 accordance with the following schedule. The load shall be raised from one increment to another
 immediately after recording the ground anchor movement.
 Test Load Schedule
 AL
 0.25 DL
 0.50 DL
 0.75 DL
 1.00 DL
 1.20 DL
 1.33 DL
 1.0 DL - LO
 Where: AL = Alignment Load
 DL = Design Load
 LO = Lock Off Load
 Except for the 1.33 DL load, each load shall be held until movement stabilizes, but a
 minimum of 1 minute, and the ground anchor movement measured to the nearest 0.001-inch from
 a fixed reference point. The maximum test load (1.33 DL) shall be held constant for a minimum
 of 5 minutes with movement measurements made at 0, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 minutes. If the difference
 between the 0.5 and 5 minute-measurement is greater than 0.08-inch, then the 1.33 DL shall be
 held constant for an additional 50 minutes with measurements taken at 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60
 minutes. A graph shall be constructed showing a plot of ground anchor movements versus load
 for each load increment in the test. At the completion of a successful load test, the anchor load
 shall be reduced to 1.0 DL and transferred to the permanent stressing anchorage. The ground
 anchor may be completely unloaded prior to lock-off. After transferring the load and prior to
 removing the jack, a lift-off load reading shall be made. The lift-off load shall be within 10 percent
 of specified lock-off load. If the load is not within 10 percent of the lock-off load, the anchorage
 shall be reset and another lift-off reading shall be made. This process shall be repeated until the
 desired lock-off load is obtained.
 a. Proof Loading Testing. Acceptance criteria at the maximum specified test load (1.33
 DL) are as follows:
 1. The total movement measured at the anchor head shall be greater than 80 percent of
 the theoretical elastic elongation of the stressing length.
 2. The total movement measured at the anchor head shall be less than the theoretical
 elastic elongation of the tendon length measured from the head of the jack to the center of the
 installed bond length.
 8-34
 
 3. The creep movement measured at the anchor head shall be less than 0.08-inch
 between the 0.5 and 5 minute-readings or less than 0.08-inch between the 5 and 60 minutereadings. The stressing length shall be measured from the stressing anchorage to the bond
 length top.
 If any anchor fails to meet acceptance criteria 1, the Contractor shall either release tension
 on, or remove the anchor and provide an additional anchor.
 If any anchor fails to meet acceptance criteria 2 or 3, the Contractor shall retest the anchor
 and determine the actual capacity which will produce the acceptance criteria. An additional
 anchor shall be installed in accordance with this Specification at a location specified by the
 Engineer and tested to verify if the total capacity of the two anchors exceeds the 1.33 DL load.
 If it is determined that the anchor failure is through no fault of the Contractor, then compensation
 will be made for additional anchor(s) and the subsequent testing thereof.

 SECTION 806
 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION
 806.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of the provision of heavy timber construction for
 bridge superstructures, roadway decks, sidewalks, railings, and for other similar purposes at the
 locations indicated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer, all in accordance with these
 Specifications.
 806.02 MATERIALS.
 806.02.1. Timber. Sawn lumber, structural glued laminated timber and wood preservative
 treatment shall conform to the requirements of SECTION M.11; TIMBER.
 806.02.2 Hardware. Metal fastenings required for timber connections or for connecting timber
 to concrete or steel work shall conform to the applicable requirements of Subsection M.05.04.13
 of these Specifications.
 806.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 806.03.1 Workmanship. All timber shall be accurately cut and framed to a close fit in such
 manner that the joints will have even bearing over the entire contact surfaces. Unless otherwise
 specified, nails and spikes shall be driven just sufficiently to set the heads flush with the surface
 of the wood. Deep hammer marks in wood surfaces shall be considered evidence of poor
 workmanship and shall be deemed sufficient cause for rejection of the work.
 806.03.2 Preservative Treatment of Timber and Lumber. All timber and lumber designated
 for treatment in the Contract Documents shall be treated by the pressure process in accordance
 with the standard practices of the American Wood Preservers Association (AWPA). AWPA
 standard specifications and practices for Preservatives, Commodities, Analysis, Miscellaneous
 Standards, and Evaluation Standards shall be as specified in the Contract Documents. If not sospecified, the appropriate standards and specifications from AWPA for the project conditions shall
 be utilized. Unless otherwise specified, the pressure process utilized shall be the "empty cell"
 process, followed by an expansion bath where applicable, vacuum to 22 inches of mercury at sea
 level and final steam cleaning. The preservative utilized shall be as specified in the Contract
 Documents.
 806.03.3 Handling of Timber and Lumber.
 a. Untreated Timber. Untreated timber and lumber at the site of the work shall be openstacked on supports at least 12 inches above the ground and shall be so stacked and stripped
 as to permit free circulation of air between the tiers and courses. When required by the Engineer,
 it shall be protected from the weather by suitable covering.
 8-37
 
 b. Treated Timber. Treated timber and lumber shall be close-stacked and placed in a
 position as to facilitate thorough drainage of any preservative remaining on the material and shall
 otherwise conform to the requirements of AWPA Standard M4.
 1. Handling. Treated timber shall be handled carefully without sudden dropping, bruising,
 breaking of outer fibers or penetrating the surface with tools. It shall be handled with rope or web
 slings. Cant hooks, peaveys, pikes or hooks shall not be used. Corner protectors shall be
 provided to prevent damage to timber bundled with metal bands or straps.
 2. Cuts and Abrasions. All cutting, framing and boring of treated timber shall be
 performed before treatment insofar as is practicable. All cuts and abrasions made after treatment
 shall be given 3 brush coats of hot preservative oil. Each coat shall be allowed to dry before the
 next coat is applied.
 3. Holes. All holes, bored after treatment, shall be treated with preservative oil by means
 of an approved pressure bolt hole treater or with hot preservative oil by other approved methods.
 Any unfilled holes, after being treated with preservative oil, shall be plugged with treated plugs.
 4. Temporary Attachments. Forms or temporary braces may be attached to treated
 timber with nails or spikes only when approved by the Engineer. Upon their removal, the holes
 shall be filled by driving galvanized nails or spikes flush with the surface, or by plugging as
 required for holes.
 806.03.4 Installation of Connectors. The split ring and the shear plate types shall be installed
 in precut grooves of dimensions as recommended by the manufacturer. Spike grids shall be
 forced into the wood so that timbers will be in firm contact. Pressure equipment that does not
 damage the wood shall be utilized.
 Connector grooves in timber shall be cut concentric with the bolt hole, shall conform to the
 cross-sectional shape of the rings, and shall provide a snug fit. Inside groove diameter shall be
 larger than nominal ring diameter in order that the ring will expand slightly during installation.
 Fabrication of all structural members using connectors shall be done prior to preservative
 treatment. When prefabricated from templates or shop details, bolt holes shall not be more than
 1/16-inch from required placement. Bolt holes shall be 1/16-inch larger than the finished bolt
 diameter. Bolt holes shall be bored perpendicular to the face of the timber.
 Timber after fabrication shall be stored in a manner that will prevent changes in the
 dimensions of the members before assembly. Timber should be cured before fabrication so that
 it will remain stable in its dimensions. Timber that shrinks during storage causing predrilled
 grooves for split rings or plates to become elliptical or causing bolt hole spacing to change will
 be sufficient reason for rejection.
 806.03.5 Countersinking. Countersinking shall be done wherever smooth faces are required.
 Recesses formed in treated timber for countersinking shall be treated as required for cuts and
 abrasions.
 
 8-38
 
 806.03.6 Hardware.
 a. Rods. Rods connecting only sawed timbers shall be threaded sufficiently at each end
 to provide tight connections, allowing only for permissible variations in dimensions of material.
 b. Bolts. The length specified shall be the length measured under the head. Bolts may
 be substituted for rods for timber connections where the length of threaded portion provided by
 the bolt is sufficient.
 c. Lag Screws. Lag screws shall be installed by turning them into place. They may be
 driven sufficiently to start them into the holes and hold them firmly in place for turning. Pre-drilling
 shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection 806.03.7, below.
 d. Nuts and Washers. Washers or plate washers shall be used under all nuts, bolt
 heads, and lag screws that would otherwise come in contact with wood, except under large
 diameter heads of specially designed flat head bolts. All nuts shall be standard square nuts.
 They shall be tightened sufficiently to prevent the rods or bolts from becoming loose during
 service and, after being tightened, they shall be effectively secured against backing off by burring
 of the rod or bolt threads, or as otherwise specified or approved by the Engineer.
 e. Nails and Spikes. Nails shall not extend through all material into which they pass
 except when approved by the Engineer. When so-indicated, nails and spikes shall be driven in
 the pattern and quantities indicated on the Plans. Distance and spacing requirements shall
 generally adhere to the following:
 End distance (tension members)
 15d;
 End distance (compression members)
 12d;
 Edge distance
 10d;
 when "d" equals the diameter of nails or spikes.
 Nails or spikes shall be driven through the thinner member into the thicker member, and
 be flush or countersunk to the member surface. Pre-bored holes, when required, shall be drilled
 in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection 806.03.7, below.
 806.03.7 Holes for Bolts, Dowels, Rods, Lag Screws, Nails and Spikes. Holes for round drift
 bolts and dowels shall be bored with a bit sized 1/16-inch less in diameter than the bolt or dowel
 to be used. The diameter of holes for square drift bolts or dowels shall be equal to the least
 dimension of the bolt or dowels.
 Holes for machine bolts shall be bored with a bit of the same diameter as the bolt, with a
 tolerance of plus 1/16-inch; minus zero.
 Holes for rods shall be bored with a bit 1/16-inch greater in diameter than the rod.
 Holes for lag screws shall be bored with a bit not larger than the body of the screw at
 the base of the thread. To prevent splitting or stripping of the threads, a lead hole for the
 shank shall be bored with a bit of the same diameter and to the same depth as the shank. The
 depth of holes for lag screws shall be one-inch less than the length under the thread. Lag
 8-39
 
 screws shall not be driven into the lead hole with a hammer but shall be turned in by means of
 a wrench.
 Spikes and nails are generally hand-driven but may be power driven for the smaller
 diameters and lengths. Holes for large diameter spikes and nails (generally greater than 1/4-inch)
 shall be pre-bored to prevent the wood from splitting during driving. The diameter of the lead hole
 must not exceed 0.9 times the diameter of the fasteners for wood species with specific gravities
 greater than 0.6, and no more than 0.75 times the diameter of the fastener for wood species with
 specific gravities less than 0.6. Pre-bored holes shall not extend into the members which will be
 holding the point of the nail or spike.
 806.03.8 Framing. All lumber and timber shall be accurately cut and framed to a close fit in
 such manner that the joints will have even bearing over the entire contact surfaces. Mortises
 shall be true to size for their full depth and tenons shall fit snugly. No shimming will be permitted
 in making joints, nor will open joints be accepted.

 When specified in the Special Provisions, a full-size template of the arch ring shall be laid
 out near the quarry site, showing face dimensions of each ring stone and thickness of joints. The
 template shall be approved by the Engineer before the shaping of any ring stone is started, and
 no ring stone shall be placed in the structure until all ring stones have been shaped, dressed, and
 approved by the Engineer.
 b. Selection and Placing of Stone.
 1. General. When masonry is placed on a prepared foundation bed, the bed shall be firm
 and normal to, or in steps normal to, the face of the wall, and approved by the Engineer before
 any stone is placed. When it is placed on foundation masonry, the bearing surface of the
 foundation masonry shall be cleaned thoroughly and in a saturated-surface dry condition when
 the mortar bed is spread.
 All masonry shall be constructed by experienced workmen. Face stones shall be set in
 random bond to produce the effect shown on the Plans.
 Care shall be taken to prevent the bunching of small stones or stones of the same size.
 When weathered or colored stones, or stones of varying texture, are being used, care shall be
 exercised to distribute the various kinds of stones uniformly throughout the exposed faces of the
 work. Large stones shall be used for the bottom courses and large, selected stones shall be used
 in the corners. In general, the stones shall decrease in size from the bottom to the top of work.
 Each stone shall be cleaned and thoroughly saturated with water before being set and the
 bed which is to receive it shall be clean and well moistened. All stones shall be well bedded in
 freshly made mortar. The mortar joints shall be full and the stones carefully settled in place
 before the mortar has set. No spalls will be permitted in the beds. No pinning up of stones with
 spalls will be permitted in beds.
 Stone shall not be dropped upon, or slid over the wall, nor will hammering, rolling, or
 turning of stones on the wall be allowed. They shall be carefully set without jarring the stone
 8-47
 
 already laid and they shall be handled with a lewis or other appliance that will not cause
 disfigurement.
 In case any stone is moved or the joint broken, the stone shall be taken up, the mortar
 thoroughly cleaned from bed and joints, and the stone reset in fresh mortar.
 2. Rubble Masonry. Rubble masonry shall be laid to line and in courses roughly leveled
 up. The bottom or foundation courses shall be composed of large, selected stones and all
 courses shall be laid with bearing beds parallel to the natural bed of the material. The vertical
 joints in each course of rubble masonry shall break with those in adjoining courses at least 6
 inches. In no case shall a vertical joint be so located as to occur directly above or below a
 header.
 3. Ashlar Masonry. For all range cut stone masonry the stone shall be laid with alternate
 stretchers and headers, shall conform to the general dimensions, shapes and arrangement
 shown on the Plans. The stones in any one course of ashlar masonry shall be placed so as to
 form bonds of not less than 12 inches with the stones of adjoining courses. Headers shall be
 placed over stretchers and, in general, the headers of each course shall equally divide the spaces
 between the headers of adjoining courses, but no header shall be placed over a joint and no joint
 shall be made over a header. The thickness of stretches and headers shall be as shown on the
 Plans or as specified in SECTION M.14; STONE FOR MASONRY.
 4. Split Face. For all split faced masonry, selected stones, squared and pitched to line,
 shall be used at all angles, wall expansion and contraction joints, and other arrises. Copings and
 belt stones shall be dressed for the required jointing and exposed corners shall be pitched parallel
 to each other. Exposed surfaces shall have projections of not more than 1 inch. The bed and
 interior ends shall be cut normal to the pitch lines.
 5. Sample Section. If required, the Contractor shall build at a location designated, a
 sample section of wall not less than 5 feet high and 8 feet long, showing examples of face wall
 and method of forming joints. The sample section shall be subject to the Engineer's approval
 prior to the start of wall facing.
 c. Beds, Joints and Pointing.
 1. Beds and Joints. Face joints for all cut stone shall not exceed ½-inch; face joints for
 split face masonry shall not exceed 1 inch; and face joints for rubble masonry shall not exceed
 1½-inches. The joints in the interior of the wall shall average not more than 1½-inches for rubble
 masonry.
 The thickness or beds in ashlar masonry may vary as shown from the bottom to the top
 of the work. However, in each course the beds shall be of uniform thickness throughout.
 Beds shall not extend in an unbroken line through more than five stones.
 Joints in ashlar masonry shall be vertical. In all other masonry, joints may be at angles
 with the vertical from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.
 
 8-48
 
 Each face stone shall bond with all contiguous face stones at least 6 inches longitudinally
 and 2 inches vertically. Ring stone joints on the faces and soffits shall be not less than 1/4-inch
 nor more than 1½-inches in thickness.
 Cross beds for vertical walls shall be level and for battered walls may vary from level to
 normal to the batter line of the face of the wall. All joints shall be completely filled with mortar.
 2. Pointing. Pointing shall not be done in freezing weather or when the stone contains
 frost.
 Whenever possible, face joints shall be properly pointed before the mortar sets. Joints
 which cannot be immediately pointed shall be prepared for pointing by raking them out to a depth
 of 2 inches before the mortar has set. The face surfaces of stones shall not be smeared with
 mortar forced out of joints or that used in pointing.
 Joints not pointed at the time the stone is laid shall be thoroughly wet with clean water and
 filled with mortar. The mortar shall be well driven into the joints and finished with an approved
 pointing tool. The mortar in joints on top surfaces shall be crowned slightly at the center of the
 masonry to provide drainage. Walls shall be kept wet while pointing is being performed, and in
 hot or dry weather the pointed masonry shall be protected from the sun and kept wet for a period
 of at least 3 days after completion.
 After the pointing is completed and the mortar set, the wall shall be thoroughly cleaned
 and left in a neat and workmanlike condition.
 3. Leaded Joints. When shown on the Plans or specified, horizontal and vertical joints
 shall be leaded to the designated size and depth. The mortar joints shall be raked out clean to
 the specified depth, but in no case less than 3/4-inch. Joints shall not be leaded before the
 concrete backing has been placed. Lead wool shall be thoroughly tamped into place with a
 caulking tool and finished with a bead for the width of the joint.
 d. Headers. Headers shall hold in the heart of the wall the same size as shown in the
 face, and shall extend not less than 12 inches into the core. They shall occupy not less than onefifth of the face area of the wall and shall be evenly distributed.
 Headers in walls 3 feet or less in thickness shall extend entirely through the wall.
 Headers in ashlar masonry shall be placed in each course and shall have a width of not
 less than 1½ times their thickness. In walls having a thickness of 4 feet or less, the headers shall
 extend entirely through the wall. In walls of greater thickness, the length of headers shall be not
 less than 2½ times their thickness when the course is 18 inches or less in height, and not less
 than 4 feet in courses of greater height. Headers shall be spaced not further apart than 8 feet
 center to center. There shall be at least one header to every two stretchers.
 e. Cores and Backing.
 1. General. Cores and backing shall consist either of compactly laid and interlocked
 stones including headers and stretchers or of concrete.
 
 8-49
 
 The headers and stretchers in walls having a thickness of 3 feet or less shall have a width
 or length equal to the full thickness of the wall. No backing or core will be allowed.
 2. Stone. When stone is used for cores or backing, at least one-half of the stone shall
 be of the same size and character as the face stone, and the remaining stones shall be of sizes
 and shapes that facilitate proper interlocking with face stones. No course shall be less than 8
 inches thick.
 Stone backing shall be laid in the same manner as specified above for face stone, with
 headers interlocking with face headers when the thickness of the wall will permit. Backing shall
 be laid to break joints with the face stone. Stone cores shall be laid in full mortar beds so as to
 bond not less than 12 inches with face and backing stone and with each other. Bed joints in
 cores and backing shall not exceed 1 inch in thickness and vertical joints shall not exceed 2
 inches in width.
 3. Concrete. The placement and consolidation of concrete adjacent to the ashlar
 masonry facing shall be done in a manner that will insure the filling of all spaces around the
 stones and secure full contact and efficient bond with all stone surfaces.
 4. Leveling Courses. Stone cores and backing shall be carried up to the approximate
 level of the face course before the succeeding course is started.
 5. Concrete Backing.
 Unless otherwise specified, the stone masonry shall be constructed before placing
 concrete.
 Steel anchors as shown on the Plans or specified in the Special Provisions shall be used.
 To improve the bond between the stone masonry and the concrete backing, the back of the
 masonry shall be made as uneven as the stones will permit.
 After the stone facing has been laid and the mortar has attained sufficient strength, all
 surfaces against which concrete is to be placed shall be cleaned carefully and all dirt, loose
 material, and accumulations of mortar droppings removed.
 When placing concrete all interstices of the masonry shall be filled and the concrete
 thoroughly spaded and worked until it is brought into intimate contact with every part of the back
 of the masonry.
 Unless otherwise indicated on the Plans, horizontal construction joints in the concrete
 backing shall be made at grades which will break joints of the stone facing. Concrete courses
 shall be approximately 4 feet in depth.
 f. Dowels and Cramps. Where required, coping stone, stone in the wings of abutments,
 and stone in piers shall be secured with wrought iron or galvanized steel cramps or dowels as
 shown on the Plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 Dowel holes that will be covered by stone masonry shall be drilled through each stone
 before the stone is placed and, after it is in place, such dowel holes shall be extended by drilling
 into the underlying course not less than 6 inches. On those stones where it is desirable to avoid
 8-50
 
 drill holes through the top surfaces, they shall be concealed by setting and grouting the stones
 over dowels set in the preceding course, or by some similar method. The size and number of
 dowel holes and size and length of dowels shall be as shown on the Plans or as directed.
 Cramps or dowels shall be of the shapes and dimensions shown on the Plans or approved
 by the Engineer. They shall be inset in the stone so as to clear the bed of the succeeding course
 and shall be located in such a manner as to securely bond the stone courses together or stone
 facing to the concrete backing.
 Cramps and dowels shall be set in lead, care being taken to completely fill the surrounding
 spaces with the molten metal, or shall be rigidly anchored by other means approved by the
 Engineer.
 g. Copings. Stones for copings of wall, pier, and abutment bridge seats shall be carefully
 selected and fully dimensioned stones. On piers, not more than two stones shall be used to
 make up the entire width of coping. The copings of abutment bridge seats shall be of sufficient
 width to extend at least 4 inches under the backwall. Each step forming the coping of a wingwall
 shall be formed by a single stone which shall overlap the stone forming the step immediately
 below it at least 12 inches.
 Tops of copings shall be given a bevel cut at least 2 inches wide, and beds, bevel cuts,
 and tops shall be fine-finished. The vertical joints shall be smooth-finished and the copings shall
 be laid with joints not more than 1/4-inch in thickness. The underside of projecting copings,
 preferable, shall have a drip bead.
 Joints in copings shall be located so as to provide not less than a 12-inch bond with the
 stones of the under course and so that no joint will come directly under the superstructure
 masonry plates.
 h. Bracing. When, in the opinion of the Engineer, bracing is necessary to hold the stone
 in proper position, the Contractor shall construct such bracing in a manner satisfactory to the
 Engineer.
 i. Cleaning Exposed Surfaces. All face stones shall be thoroughly cleaned of mortar
 stains immediately after being laid and while the mortar is fresh. The stones shall be kept clean
 until the work is completed. After the pointing is completed and the mortar set, the wall shall be
 thoroughly cleaned and left in a neat and workmanlike condition.
 807.03.4 Brick or Block Masonry.
 a. Laying Brick and Block. The blocks or bricks shall be laid in such manner as will
 thoroughly bond them into the mortar by means of the "shove-joint" method; "buttered" or
 plastered joints will not be permitted. All clay or shale brick must be thoroughly saturated with
 water before being laid. Dampening of concrete masonry units before or during construction shall
 not be permitted unless approved by the Engineer. The arrangement of headers and stretchers
 shall be such as will thoroughly bond the mass and, unless otherwise specified, work shall be of
 alternate headers and stretchers with consecutive courses breaking joints. Other types of
 bonding, as for ornamental work, shall be as specified on the Plans.
 All joints shall be completely filled with mortar. They shall not be less than 1/4-inch and
 not more than 5/8-inch in thickness and the thickness shall be uniform throughout. All joints shall
 8-51
 
 be finished properly as the work progresses and on exposed faces they shall be neatly struck,
 using the "weather" joint.
 No spalls or bats shall be used except for shaping around irregular openings or when
 unavoidable to finish out a course, in which case full bricks shall be placed at the corners, the
 bats being placed in the interior of the course.
 Each masonry unit shall be adjusted to its final position while mortar is still soft and plastic.
 Units which are disturbed after mortar has stiffened shall be removed and relayed in fresh mortar.
 Vertical cells to be filled with grout shall be aligned to provide a continuous unobstructed
 opening.
 Piers and walls may be built of solid brick work, or may consist of a brick or block shell
 backed with concrete or other suitable material as specified on the Plans. All details of the
 construction shall be in accordance with approved practice and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 b. Placement of Reinforcement. Prior to and during grouting the reinforcing steel shall
 be securely held in position at the top and bottom and at intermediate points not exceeding 200
 bar diameters or 10 feet apart. Bars shall be maintained clear of the cell walls and within plus
 or minus ½-inch of their planned position transverse to the wall and within plus or minus 2 inches
 of their planned position longitudinal to the wall.
 c. Grouted Brick or Block Construction. Grouted masonry shall be constructed in such
 a manner that all elements of the masonry act together as a structural element.
 Prior to grouting, the grout space shall be clean so that all spaces to be filled with grout
 do not contain mortar projections greater than ½-inch, mortar droppings or other foreign material.
 Grout shall be placed so that all spaces to be grouted do not contain voids.
 Grout materials and water content shall be controlled to provide adequate fluidity for
 placement, without segregation.
 Size and height limitations of the grout space or cell on the average shall not be less than
 shown in Table No. 1. Higher grout pours or smaller cavity widths or cell size than shown in
 Table 1 may be used when approved by the Engineer, if it is demonstrated that grout spaces are
 properly filled.
 When required by Table No. 1, cleanouts shall be provided in the bottom course at every
 vertical bar but shall not be spaced more than 32 inches on center for solidly grouted masonry.
 Cleanouts shall be of sufficient size to allow removal of debris.
 Units may be laid to the full height of the grout pour and grout shall be placed in a
 continuous pour in grout lifts not exceeding 6 feet. If construction joints are used in columns of
 grout, they shall be located at least 1½-inches below the level of a mortar bed joint.
 Segregation of the grout materials and damage to the masonry shall be avoided during
 the grouting process.
 
 8-52
 
 Grout shall be consolidated before loss of plasticity in a manner to fill the grout space.
 Grout pours greater than 12 inches in height shall be mechanically reconsolidated to minimize
 voids due to water loss. Grout not mechanically vibrated shall be puddled.

 The clear dimension is the cell or group space width less mortar projects.
 Grout space width shall be increased by the horizontal projection of the diameters of the horizontal
 bars within the cross section of the grout space.
 Cleanouts may be omitted if approved provisions are made to keep the grout space clean prior to
 grouting.
 
 In nonstructural elements, mortar of pouring consistency may be substituted for grout
 when the masonry is constructed and grouted in pours of 12 inches or less.
 Vertical barriers of masonry may be built across the grout space. The grouting of any
 section of wall between barriers shall be completed in one day with no interruption longer than
 one hour.
 d. Copings, Bridge Seats, and Backwalls. The tops of retaining walls, abutment
 wingwalls and similarly exposed brick or block work shall be provided, in general, with a stone
 coping. The underside of the coping shall have a batter or drip bead, at least 1 inch beyond the
 face of the block or brick work wall. The coping upon an abutment backwall will commonly have
 no projection beyond its bridge seat face. For thin copings, mortar of the same proportions as
 used for laying the block or brick may be used to produce precast sections not less than 3 feet
 nor more than 5 feet in length. No coping shall be less than 4 inches thick.
 Copings of piers and abutment bridge seats shall be of Ashlar stone work and shall
 conform to the requirements of Para. b.3 of Subsection 807.03.3 of these Specifications.

 808.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 808.03.1 General. The requirements for classification, proportioning, batching, mixing,
 transportation, placing, curing, and testing of concrete shall conform to the requirements of
 SECTION 601; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE.
 808.03.2 Footings. Preparation of foundations shall conform to the requirements of SECTION
 203; STRUCTURE EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL. No concrete shall be placed until after the
 Engineer has approved the depth and dimensions of the excavation, the character of the material
 and the condition of the foundation. No footing shall be supported partially on rock and partially
 on soil. The rock shall be excavated as necessary to allow the placement of 12 inches of gravel
 in accordance with Subsection 203.03.1; Excavation. The Engineer may direct, in writing, such
 changes in dimensions or elevations of footings as may be necessary to obtain satisfactory
 foundations. The Plans will be revised accordingly.
 a. Foundations Under Water. When required by the Contract Special Provisions,
 foundations to be constructed under water shall be inspected by divers hired by the Contractor
 independently and solely for the purpose of the inspection requirements of the Contract. The
 diver shall be a professional engineer registered by the State of Rhode Island and shall be
 appropriately certified to perform the intended work.
 In general, the diver's tasks shall include inspection of the excavations for foundations to
 determine their completeness and suitability for the placement of concrete, inspection of the
 drilling and grouting operations for any dowels that may be specified, and inspection of the tremie
 placement operations to insure that the concrete placement is proceeding properly and is
 completed in accordance with applicable contract Specifications.
 The diver shall be responsible to report any discrepancies in materials or workmanship
 to the Engineer. The diver shall record his/her findings by written and photographic methods and
 a final report of findings, recommendations and actions taken shall be prepared for the Engineer.
 Measurement and payment for the diving services shall be as outlined in the Special Provisions.
 808.03.3 Falsework and Centering. All falsework or centering shall be adequate for the type
 of construction involved and shall conform to the requirements of Paragraph 3.2; Falsework and
 Forms, of the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, latest revision. The
 Contractor shall submit all shop drawings for falsework and centering, including design
 computations formally signed and sealed by the Contractor's Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer, all in accordance with Subsection 105.02; Plans and Shop Drawings, of these
 Specifications.
 The Contractor's professional engineer shall certify that the falsework system has been
 assembled and constructed according to the approved falsework drawings, prior to placing loads
 on such falsework.
 When structures are to be constructed over railroad tracks, the centering shall also
 conform to the requirements of the railroad company as to temporary operating clearances, safety
 and design.
 
 8-56
 
 808.03.4 Forms.
 a. General. When required, the Contractor shall prepare detailed plans for all important
 forms. This requirement includes design computations formally signed and sealed by the
 Contractor's Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer, and otherwise in accordance with
 Subsection 105.02; Plans and Shop Drawings, of these Specifications. Such plans shall be
 approved by the Engineer before any work is started on construction of the forms. So-called snap
 ties shall not be used, and removable cones shall be of minimum diameter. Where forms are to
 be suspended from the structural steel girders, snap-tie hangers, wires or other devices that
 cannot be readily adjusted to provide mortar-tight joints will not be approved. Slab forms shall
 not bear on interior diaphragms.
 Forms shall not be installed over steel supporting members until after the steel erection
 and touch-up painting is completed.
 Provision shall be included in the form for a standard 3/4-inch symmetrical chamfer at all
 square entrant concrete corners unless otherwise indicated on the Plans.
 b. Wood Forms. All face forms shall be constructed of lumber 3/4-inch or more in
 thickness lined with pressed wood-fibre or plywood not less than 1/4-inch in thickness. Sheet
 metal (preferably noncorrosive) of approved gauge may be substituted.
 As an alternate method of construction, face forms may be made up of plywood, 5/8-inch
 or more in thickness, without backing boards if properly designed and supported. Such alternate
 construction shall provide a rigid form which will prevent unacceptable deformations in the
 finished concrete surface.
 All pressed wood-fibre or plywood forms shall be suitably tempered or waterproofed at the
 time of manufacture to prevent the absorption of moisture and shall be of an approved type.
 When lining is used, the wood forms shall be of the usual construction with the boards
 closely spaced. The lining shall be in sheets of maximum useable size and shall be applied
 smooth side to the concrete. Joints between panels shall be taped or filled to provide a smooth,
 tight form surface.
 Metal ties or anchorages which are required within the forms to hold them to correct
 alignment and location shall be so constructed that the metal work can be removed to a depth
 of at least 2 inches from the exposed surface of the concrete without causing injury to such
 surface by spalling or otherwise. When permitted for secondary forms, all wires, upon removal
 of the forms, shall be cut back at least ½-inch from the face of the concrete with sharp chisels or
 nippers.
 All fittings for metal ties shall be of such design that, upon their removal, the cavities which
 are left shall be of the smallest possible size. The cavities shall be filled with cement mortar of
 fine aggregate and cement in the proportion that has been employed for the particular class of
 concrete treated, and the surface left smooth, even and uniform in color.
 Formwork lines shall be straight and true and forms shall be mortar-tight and well tied and
 braced to prevent bulging. Block shims or wedges must be properly secured before placing
 8-57
 
 concrete. Formwork shall be treated with a form release agent approved by the Engineer or be
 saturated with water just before placing concrete.
 The form release agent used shall not discolor or otherwise injuriously affect the concrete
 surface or subsequent finish. Release agents must be applied to the forms before the
 reinforcement is placed. All excess release agent shall be removed from the face surfaces, and
 the ties and reinforcement shall be thoroughly cleaned with an approved solvent where
 necessary.
 c. Metal Forms. The applicable requirements for wood forms shall apply to metal forms.
 The metal used for forms shall be of such thickness that the forms will remain true to shape. All
 bolt and rivet heads shall be countersunk. Clamps, pins or other connecting devices shall be
 designed to hold the forms rigidly together and to allow removal without injury to the concrete.
 Metal forms which do not present a smooth surface or line up properly shall not be used. Special
 care shall be exercised to keep metal forms free from rust, grease or other foreign matter which
 will discolor the concrete.
 808.03.5 Placing Concrete (Conventional Method).
 a. General. In preparation for the placing of concrete, all sawdust, chips, standing water
 and other construction debris and extraneous matter shall be removed from the interior of forms.
 Struts, stays and braces, serving temporarily to hold the forms in correct shape and alignment,
 pending the placing of concrete at their locations, shall be removed when the concrete placing
 has reached an elevation rendering their service unnecessary. These temporary members shall
 be entirely removed from the forms and not buried in the concrete, unless directed otherwise by
 the Engineer. Any hardware allowed to remain in the formwork shall be cut back to the design
 cover for reinforcement. The resulting recess in the concrete surface shall then be filled with a
 patching mortar approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor will be required to notify the Engineer twenty-four hours in advance of
 placing concrete in order to provide ample time for the inspection of forms, steel reinforcement,
 materials and equipment.
 Concrete shall be placed and consolidated by methods that will neither cause segregation
 of materials nor displacement of reinforcement and that will result in a dense homogeneous
 concrete which is free of voids and rock pockets. Prior to the actual placement of concrete, the
 Engineer may require the Contractor to demonstrate the capability of the equipment to convey
 the concrete mixture to maintain the specified quality. If the quality of concrete reaching the form
 is found to be inadequate as a result of the method of concrete placement, the Engineer may
 order the work to be discontinued and require the substitution of a satisfactory method of concrete
 placement.
 The use of aluminum for chutes on pipes shall not be permitted.
 Open chutes shall be of metal or metal lined. Where steep slopes are required, the
 chutes shall be equipped with baffles erected in short lengths to slow the movement of concrete.
 Concrete shall not be dropped a distance of more than 5 feet, and special care shall be
 taken to fill each part of the form by depositing the concrete as near to its final position as
 possible. Where placing operations would involve dropping the concrete more than 5 feet, such
 8-58
 
 as piers, columns, thin walls, etc., it shall be deposited through sheet metal or other approved
 pipes. As far as practical, pipes shall be kept full of concrete during placing, and their lower ends
 shall be kept buried in the newly placed concrete.
 All chutes and pipes shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete by
 thoroughly flushing with water after each run.
 Concrete shall be consolidated by mechanical, high frequency internal or external
 vibrators, or both, in a manner acceptable to the Engineer. Vibrators shall be of a type and size
 suited to the purpose. Handheld vibrators shall be equipped with rubber tipped heads when used
 to consolidate around epoxy-coated reinforcement.
 Vibrators shall be manipulated so as to thoroughly work the concrete around the
 reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into the corners and angles of forms. The vibration
 at any point shall of sufficient duration to accomplish thorough consolidation but shall not be
 prolonged to the point where segregation or bleeding occurs.
 Vibration shall not be applied directly to, or through the reinforcement to sections or layers
 of concrete which have hardened to the degree the concrete ceases to be plastic under such
 vibration. Vibrators shall not be used to transport concrete in the forms.
 Concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers not more than 12 inches thick, except as
 hereinafter provided. When less than a complete layer is placed in one operation, it shall be
 terminated in a vertical bulkhead. Each layer shall be placed and consolidated before the
 preceding course has taken initial set to avoid the formation of a cold joint with the preceding
 course.
 In case the placing of concrete is temporarily delayed, the concrete shall be covered
 immediately and kept moist to retard initial set until placement can resume. In case the placing
 of concrete is temporarily discontinued, a construction joint shall be formed immediately.
 Laitance and other objectionable material shall be cleaned from the new construction joint when
 placement is scheduled to resume.
 To avoid visible joints as far as possible upon exposed faces, the top surface of the
 concrete adjacent to the forms shall be smoothed with a trowel. Where a "feather edge" might
 be produced at a construction joint, as in the sloped surface of a wingwall, an inset form shall be
 used to produce a blocked-out portion in the preceding layer which shall produce an edge
 thickness of not less than 6 inches in the succeeding layer. Work shall not be discontinued within
 18 inches of the top of any face, unless provision has been made for a coping less than 18 inches
 thick. In such case, and if permitted by the Engineer, the construction joint may be made at the
 underside of the coping.
 Immediately following the discontinuance of placing concrete, all accumulations of mortar
 splashed upon the reinforcing steel and the surface of forms shall be removed. Dried mortar
 chips and dust shall not be puddled into the unset concrete. If the accumulations are not
 removed prior to the concrete becoming set, care shall be exercised not to injure or break the
 concrete-steel bond at and near the surface of the concrete while cleaning the reinforcing steel.
 b. Vertical Members. Concrete for columns, substructure and culvert walls, and other
 similar vertical members shall be placed and allowed to set and settle for a period of time before
 8-59
 
 concrete for integral horizontal members, such as caps, slabs or footings is placed. Such period
 shall be adequate to allow completion of settlement due to loss of bleed water and shall be not
 less than 12 hours for vertical members over 15 feet in height and not less than 30 minutes for
 members over 5 feet but not over 15 feet in height. When friction collars or falsework brackets
 are mounted on such vertical members and unless otherwise approved, the vertical member shall
 have been in place at least seven days and shall have attained its specified strength before loads
 from horizontal members are applied.
 c. Slabs. Before any slab concrete is placed, an approved templet and finishing tools
 shall be on hand for striking off the surface of the slab to the required crown, as shown on the
 Plans.
 For bridge deck slabs, refer to SECTION 814; PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE
 DECKS, of these Specifications.
 d. Superstructure. Unless otherwise permitted, no concrete shall be placed in the
 superstructure until substructure forms have been stripped sufficiently to determine the character
 of the supporting substructure concrete.
 Concrete for T-beam or deck girder spans whose depth is less than 4 feet may be
 placed in one continuous operation or may be placed in two separate operations; first, to the top
 of the girder stems, and second, to completion. For T-beam or deck girder spans whose depth
 is 4 feet or more and, unless the falsework is non-yielding, such concrete shall be placed in two
 operations and at least five days shall elapse after placement of stems before the top deck slab
 is placed.
 Concrete for box girders may be placed in two or three separate operations consisting of
 bottom slab, girder stems and top slab. In either case the bottom slab shall be placed first and,
 unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, the top slab shall not be placed until the girder stems
 have been in place for at least five days.
 e. Arch Rings. The concrete in arch rings shall be placed in such a manner as to load
 the centering uniformly. Arch rings and ribs preferably shall be cast in a single continuous operation. However, with the permission of the Engineer, they may be divided by radial bulkheads into
 transverse sections of such size that each section can be cast in a continuous operation. The
 arrangement of the sections and the sequence of placing shall be as approved by the Engineer
 and shall be such as to avoid the distortion of the centering and consequent creation of initial
 stress in the newly placed concrete or its reinforcement. The sections shall be bonded together
 by suitable keys. Where special key sections are required, the concrete shall be mixed as dry
 as possible and consolidated by means of vibration. The spandrel walls or columns and the
 beams shall not be cast until after the centering is struck, and no part of the coping, railing, or
 floor shall be cast until the spandrel walls or columns are complete.
 f. Depositing Concrete Under Water. Concrete shall not be deposited in water except
 with the approval of the Engineer and under his immediate supervision. In this case the method
 of placing shall be as specified.
 Concrete deposited in water shall conform to the applicable requirements of Subsection
 601.01.1; Classification, of these Specifications. To prevent segregation it shall be carefully
 placed in a compact mass in its final position, by means of a tremie or other approved method,
 8-60
 
 and shall not be disturbed after being deposited. Still water shall be maintained at the point of
 deposit and the forms under water shall be watertight.
 For parts of structures under water, when possible, concrete seals shall be placed
 continuously from start to finish. The surface of the concrete shall be kept as nearly horizontal
 as practicable at all times. To insure thorough bonding, each succeeding layer of a seal shall be
 placed before the preceding layer has taken initial set.
 A tremie shall consist of a tube having a diameter of not less than 10 inches, constructed
 in sections having flanged couplings fitted with gaskets. The tremies shall be supported so as
 to permit free movement of the discharge over the entire top surface of the work to permit rapid
 lowering when necessary to retard or stop the flow of concrete. The discharge end shall be
 closed with an approved type of foot valve at each start of work, to prevent water entering the
 tube, and all joints shall be sealed so that the concrete may be discharged into the empty tube.
 The tremie tube shall be kept full to the bottom of the hopper. When a batch is dumped into the
 hopper, the flow of concrete shall be induced by slightly raising the discharge end but, always
 keeping it in the mass of deposited concrete. The flow shall be continuous until the work is
 completed.
 Dewatering may not proceed until 7 days after completion of the pour except when prior
 permission is granted by the Engineer. All laitance or other unsatisfactory material shall be removed from the exposed surface by scraping, chipping or other means such that the surface of
 the concrete will not be injured.
 g. Concrete Exposed to Sea Water. Unless shown otherwise on the Plans, no
 construction joints shall be allowed between extreme low tide and extreme high tide. In the
 determination of these ranges due consideration shall be given to wave action, ice formation and
 other conditions affecting the extreme limits of possible deterioration and disintegration.
 h. Cold Weather Concrete. Concrete operations during cold weather shall conform to
 the requirements of Subsection 601.03.5; Cold Weather Concrete.
 i. Hot Weather Concrete. Concrete operations during hot weather shall conform to the
 requirements of Subsection 601.03.6; Hot Weather Concrete.
 808.03.6 Placing Concrete by Pumping (Optional Method).
 a. Pumping. Placement of concrete by pumping will be permitted as approved by the
 Engineer. The equipment shall be arranged that no vibrations result which might damage freshly
 placed concrete. Where concrete is conveyed and placed by mechanically applied pressure, the
 equipment shall be suitable in kind and adequate in capacity for the work. The operation of the
 pump shall be such that a continuous stream of concrete without air pockets is produced. When
 pumping is completed, the concrete remaining in the pipe-line, if such is to be used, shall be
 ejected in such manner that there will be no contamination of the concrete or separation of the
 ingredients.
 b. Handling and Placing Concrete. Concrete shall be placed so as to avoid segregation
 of materials and displacement of reinforcement. Prior to the actual placement of concrete, the
 Engineer may require the Contractor to demonstrate the capability of the equipment to both
 convey the concrete mixture and maintain the specified quality. No further verification of the
 8-61
 
 equipment's capability will be required unless evidence of nonuniform concrete is observed by
 the Engineer during placement.
 Concrete shall not come in contact with aluminum during conveying and placing
 operations. When concrete pumps are used, the lines shall have a minimum diameter of 5
 inches. The specific pumping equipment which the Contractor proposes to use shall be subject
 to the approval of the Engineer.
 All chutes, troughs and pipes shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened
 concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after each run; water used for flushing shall be
 discarded clear of the concrete already in place.
 Dropping concrete a distance of more than 5 feet or depositing a large quantity at any
 point and running or working it along the forms shall not be permitted.
 Special care shall be taken to fill each part of the form by depositing concrete directly in
 the form as near to its final position as possible; to work the coarser aggregates back from the
 face of the concrete; and to force the concrete under and around the reinforcement. After the
 concrete has taken its initial set, care shall be exercised to avoid jarring the forms or placing any
 strain on the ends of projecting reinforcement.
 c. Design Mix. The Contractor shall have the option to submit for approval by the
 Engineer a pump mix design formula of the concrete mixture to be used with the specific pumping
 equipment. The concrete mixture shall meet the specific requirements of Subsection 601.03.1;
 Proportioning, for air content, cement factor, and slump for the various classes of concrete
 specified.
 d. Placing Concrete Under Water. Concrete placed under water shall be placed
 continuously from start to finish. The surface of the concrete shall be kept as nearly horizontal
 as practicable. To insure thorough bonding, each succeeding layer of seal shall be placed before
 the preceding layer has taken initial set. For large pours, more than one tremie or pump shall be
 used to insure compliance with this requirement.
 808.03.7 Expansion, Contraction and Construction Joints.
 a. Concrete Joints.
 1. General. The type and details of joints and joint fillers in concrete shall be as shown
 on the Plans. Joints shall be filled or open. Filled joints may be the poured type or filled with a
 premoulded filler. Materials for joint fillers and sealants are specified in Subsection M.02.10 of
 these Specifications.
 2. Flashing and Water Stops. Metal flashing or flexible water stops shall be furnished
 and placed as shown on the Plans. They shall be spliced, welded or soldered to form continuous
 watertight joints, and shall conform to the requirements of SECTION 812; WATER STOPS AND
 FLASHING.
 3. Construction Joints. In order to reduce the size of pours or for other construction
 reasons, additional joints may be provided at locations approved by the Engineer.
 
 8-62
 
 Particular care shall be taken with all bonded construction joints to obtain a bond between
 subsequent pourings. All laitance and debris shall be carefully chipped and cleaned from the
 surface of the hardened concrete. The contact areas shall be cleaned with a wire brush,
 moistened with water and covered with a coating of mortar or neat cement grout. The new
 concrete shall be placed before the grout has attained its initial set and shall be carefully spaded
 into position.
 Shear keys, steel dowels or inclined reinforcement approved by the Engineer shall be
 used where necessary to transmit shear, or bond the two sections together.
 4. Contraction Joints. Where a definite thickness of joint filler is not indicated on the
 Plans, bond between adjacent surfaces shall be prevented by coating the surface of the concrete
 in the section first placed with an approved bond breaking material or a sheet of approved
 nonstaining fibrous paper, or both, using the coating material as a cementing medium.
 5. Expansion Joints. Joints to be sealed shall be thoroughly cleaned of all foreign
 matter. Joint fillers shall be applied in accordance with Subsection 808.03.8; Para. a, below.

 these Specifications. The State will require proof that the proposed mastic system has a
 proven record of performance as confirmed by actual field tests and successful installations in
 New England. Those installations cited must be available for inspection by Department
 personnel. The State may require the Contractor to either conduct laboratory tests at its expense
 or submit current independent laboratory tests to substantiate compliance with the above
 requirements.
 3. Manufacturer's Representative. The supplier of mastic joint sealer shall furnish the
 services of a competent field representative of the approved manufacturer, if required to do so
 by the State. The field representative shall be present at the work site prior to any use of
 materials to instruct the Contractor, the Inspector or the Engineer on installation and inspection
 procedures and to inspect the condition of the prepared surfaces. The manufacturer's
 representative will remain at the job site after work commences until the Inspector or Engineer
 8-63
 
 are satisfied that the work crew has successfully mastered the technique of installing the mastic
 system.
 4. Installation. Installation of the mastic joint sealer shall be in accordance with the
 directions of the manufacturer. Duplicate copies of said directions shall be forwarded to the job
 site with each shipment of material.
 c. Polyurethane Joint Sealant.
 1. Preparation. All joints shall be cleaned of contaminants and impurities to the depth
 at which the sealant (and backer rod if detailed) is to be installed. Cleaning shall be by grinding,
 saw cutting blast cleaning (sand or water), mechanical abrading or a combination of such
 methods. This operation will provide a sound, clean and frost-free surface for sealant application.
 All dust, loose particles and other debris shall be blown out with oil free compressed air.
 An expanded closed cell polyethylene foam rod backup material shall be installed in joints,
 or an approved bond breaker tape shall be installed if so detailed on the Plans.
 2. Application. A primer shall be applied to the concrete surfaces of the joints. The
 primer shall be in accordance with the recommendation of the sealant manufacturer and shall not
 be applied to the backup rod or the bond breaker tape.
 The polyurethane joint sealant shall be applied in strict conformance with the manufacturer's recommendations and in no case thicker than ½-inch. The approximate width to depth
 ratio shall be 2-to-1 for working joints.
 The joint shall be tooled using a blunt instrument so that it is slightly concave. A soap
 solution may be used as a tooling aid.
 d. Polyurethane Elastomeric Joint Sealant.
 1. Preparation. The preparation requirements for this sealant are identical to those
 specified above in Para. c.1 of this Subsection for Polyurethane Joint Sealant.
 2. Application. A primer shall be applied to the concrete surfaces of the joints. The
 primer shall be in accordance with the recommendation of the sealant manufacturer and shall not
 be applied to the backup rod or the bond breaker tape.
 The polyurethane elastomeric joint sealant shall be applied in strict conformance with the
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 The sealant shall not be applied to joints less than 1/4-inch in width. The approximate
 width to depth ratio shall be 2-to-1 for working joints. The application temperature range is 40OF
 to 100OF. Sealant shall not be applied when the temperature exceeds these limits.
 The joint shall be tooled using a blunt instrument so that it is slightly concave. A soap
 solution may be used as a tooling aid.

 directions of the Engineer.
 8-64
 
 808.03.9 Curing Concrete. Portland cement concrete shall be cured in accordance with the
 requirements of Subsection 601.03.8; Curing, except as modified herein.
 a. Concrete in Massive Pours. For concrete in massive pours (a massive pour is
 defined as any pour in which the concrete dimensions in 3 directions is 5 feet or more) the
 Contractor shall thermal cure the concrete so as to maintain a temperature differential between
 the internal (hottest) and external (coolest) temperature of the concrete to a 70OF maximum.
 The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days prior to pouring any concrete which is
 considered a massive pour, furnish the Engineer with heat flow analysis for each concrete mixture
 in such a pour, proposed methods for observing, detecting and controlling the thermal differential
 between the external and internal temperatures and proposed corrective measures, for approval
 by the Engineer. No massive pour shall be placed until the above submittals are made and
 approved by the Engineer.
 b. Corrective Measures. Corrective measures to control the heat may be accomplished
 through a combination of the following:
 1. Selection of concrete ingredients to minimize the heat generated by hydration of the
 cement.
 2. Cooling component materials to reduce the temperature of the concrete while in its
 plastic state.
 3. Postcooling procedures.
 4. Controlling the rate of placing the concrete.
 5. Insulating the surface of the concrete to prevent heat loss.
 6. Providing supplemental heat at the surface of the concrete to prevent heat loss.
 7. Other acceptable methods which may be developed by the Contractor and submitted
 to the Engineer for review and approval.
 c. Minimum Requirements. The Contractor shall as a minimum requirement provide
 the following:
 1. Provide and install, within the concrete placed in each massive pour, temperature
 sensing devices of a type approved by and at locations as designated by the Engineer. These
 devices shall be accurate to within ±2OF within the temperature range of -32OF to 212OF. The
 temperatures shall be recorded automatically by an approved strip-chart recorder furnished by
 the Contractor.
 The sensing system shall contain as a minimum 2 independent sets of sensing devices
 in order to assure readings if one of the systems fail.
 The Engineer may approve manual observation and recording temperatures at 6-hour
 intervals where conditions warrant.
 2. Maintain records of temperature differential.
 8-65
 
 3. Immediately apply corrective measures approved by the Engineer, when the
 temperature differential nears 70OF so as to maintain it at 70OF maximum.
 808.03.10 Removal of Forms, Falsework and Centering. In general, forms for slabs, beams,
 pier caps and other support members shall not be removed until the concrete has reached the
 specified 28-day strength as indicated by the compression tests of field cured cylinders.
 When it is desirable to facilitate surface finish, side forms used on ornamental work,
 railings, parapets and exposed vertical surfaces (except columns) may be removed after 12
 hours.
 In warm weather, when the average temperature exceeds 50OF, the following periods for
 the removal of forms and supports may be used as a guide when field operations are not
 controlled by cylinder tests:
 Arch centers (after last pour)
 Centering under beams
 Deck slabs (over 10-foot spans)
 Deck slabs (under 10-foot spans)
 Columns and slender piers
 (depending on height)
 
 14 days
 14 days
 7-14 days
 7 days
 2-7 days
 
 In cold weather, or when the average temperature is below 50OF, removal of forms and
 falsework shall be controlled by results of the compression tests on field cured cylinders.
 Falsework and centering for filled arches shall not be struck until fills behind the abutments
 have been placed up to the spring line. Falsework supporting the deck of rigid frame structures
 shall not be removed until fills have been placed back of the vertical legs, in accordance with
 Subsection 203.03.5; Para. b, Pervious Fill Adjacent to Structures.
 Centers shall be gradually and uniformly lowered in such a manner as to avoid excessive
 stresses in any part of the structure. In arch structures of two-or-more spans, the sequence of
 striking centers shall be specified by the Engineer.
 Arch centering shall be struck and the arch made self-supporting before the railing or
 coping is placed.
 808.03.11 Concrete Finishes.
 a. General. All concrete surfaces shall be finished by experienced concrete finishers.
 Finishes for concrete bridge decks placed by self-propelled machines shall conform to the
 requirements of SECTION 814 of these Specifications. Otherwise the finishes to be applied to
 different types of surfaces shall be as follows:
 1. Float Finish. Tops of walls, piers, abutments, parapets, safety walks, sidewalks and
 medians.
 2. Rubbed Finish. All exposed surfaces visible in elevation, to 1 foot below final ground
 line and the underside of concrete slabs outside of the fascia beam unless otherwise indicated
 on the Plans.
 8-66
 
 3. Bush-hammered or Sand Blasted. As shown on Plans.
 b. Float Finish. Float finish for horizontal surfaces shall be achieved by placing excess
 concrete in the forms and striking it off with a template or screed, forcing the coarse aggregate
 below the surface. The surface shall then be finished by a wooden float to a smooth true plane.
 The area under bearing plates shall be finished as nearly as possible to 1/8-inch above the final
 elevation and then dressed to a uniform level bearing with a carborundum brick or power grinder
 after the concrete has sufficiently set.
 c. Rubbed Finish. The object of this operation is to obtain a surface that is uniform in
 texture and appearance and free of all imperfections or depressions due to form marks or other
 causes. In general, it shall be accomplished in two rubbing, the first performed as soon after the
 removal of forms as the condition of the surface warrants, and the second after the completion
 of the curing period and any subsequent work that might damage the finished appearance.
 The entire surface that is to receive a rubbed finish shall be thoroughly moistened with
 water and rubbed with a wood float or a fairly coarse carborundum stone, depending on the set
 of the concrete, to produce a paste on the surface. This rubbing shall be continued as long as
 necessary to remove form marks and projections and to produce a smooth dense surface without
 pits or irregularities, but shall not be continued to the extent that it causes noticeable exposure
 of the coarse aggregate.
 No wet rubbing shall be done when atmospheric temperatures of 40OF or less may
 normally be expected, unless the work is protected by a substantial windproof housing.
 d. Bushhammered or Sandblasted Finish. This type of finish consists of removing a
 depth of mortar from the surfaces of the walls in order to expose the aggregates and present a
 rough texture in accordance with and to the limits shown on the Plans.
 The method employed to achieve the desired results shall be by either sandblasting or
 bushhammering. No chemical retardant applied to the forms shall be used. Enough surface
 mortar shall be removed in order to expose the aggregate particles in slight relief and provide an
 overall surface with a uniform rough texture.
 Prior to finishing any concrete the Contractor shall cast a test panel approximately 4 foot
 by 4 foot in a vertical position with a joint in the form work near the approximate middle of the
 panel and demonstrate the proposed method. This method shall be satisfactory to the Engineer
 who shall be the sole judge of its acceptability. In the event the first trial panel does not produce
 satisfactory results, one or more trial panels shall be cast until a satisfactory finish is obtained.
 The surfaces to be finished shall be carefully cured. After the forms have been removed
 all holes shall be patched with an approved mortar and any fins or other protuberances removed
 to present a roughly even surface. If bushhammering is to be employed, the use of air tools is
 preferable. No finishing shall be started until the concrete has attained its 28-day strength.
 Particular care shall be taken when finishing bevels or corners so as not to damage the
 lines. After the surfaces are finished, all dust and loose particles shall be removed by brushing
 with stiff wire brushes or air blasting.

 a load cell.
 The Contractor shall be required to have a compressive strength testing machine
 conforming to the AASHTO T22 Specifications. The Contractor shall have the ability to make,
 store and cap the specimens in accordance with AASHTO Specifications. The compressive
 strength testing machine shall be calibrated at least once every 6 months and the calibration
 certificate submitted to the Engineer. The Engineer shall have full access to the compressive
 testing machine for testing.
 809.03.2 Inspection of the Plant and Facilities. Within 30 days after award of contract the
 Contractor shall notify the Engineer so that the plant and facilities to be used in fabrication of
 concrete structural elements may be inspected for approval. Fabrication of units shall be
 monitored and inspected by the Engineer. Work performed in the absence of the Engineer shall
 be automatically rejected. The Contractor shall keep the Engineer informed of the day-to-day
 scheduling of operations. The Engineer shall have free access throughout the fabrication plant
 to observe that the work being performed is in conformance with the Contract Documents.
 a. Required Notifications. Notification shall be given to the Engineer prior to:
 1. Commencement of production: 1 month.
 2. Recommencement of work after a suspension of 48 hours or more;
 (a) a minimum of 2 days when the Engineer is on site,
 (b) a minimum of 2 weeks in the absence of the Engineer from the site.
 3. Unit shipping;
 (a) a minimum of 2 days when the Engineer is on site,
 (b) a minimum of 2 weeks in the absence of the Engineer from the site.
 The Contractor should be aware that these requirements may have a direct impact on
 project schedules.
 809.03.3 Concrete Forms.
 a. General. Forms shall be constructed of steel, carefully aligned, clean, rust-free
 substantial and firm, securely braced and fastened together and sufficiently tight to prevent
 8-72
 
 leakage of mortar. All drill holes or uneven surfaces shall be repaired. All forms shall be strong
 enough to withstand the action of mechanical vibrators. All forms for each unit shall be approved
 by the Engineer prior to placing concrete.
 All form surfaces that come in contact with the concrete shall be thoroughly treated with
 a form release coating approved by the Engineer and in the manner and rate specified by the
 manufacturer. Forms so treated shall be protected against damage and dirt prior to placing
 concrete.
 Any form release coating material that will stick to or discolor the concrete shall not be
 used.
 b. Critical Dimensions. Critical dimensions, such as lengths, widths, cable locations,
 bulkhead locations, camber, position of weld plates and bearing plates, bulkhead locations and
 dimensions, blockout locations, post tensioning duct locations, keyway dimensions, dimensions
 on skewed or battered ends, expansion duct locations, insert locations, fixed and expansion
 sleeve locations, locations of voids, location of drip grooves, sizes of voids and critical dimensions
 indicated on drawings shall conform to the tolerances indicated in the current edition of P.C.I.
 Manual 116.
 c. Void-Producing Forms. Void-producing forms shall be constructed of a waterproof
 material and have a one inch diameter vent placed at each end of the void or as indicated on
 approved drawings. All voids shall be vented upon removing the concrete element from the form.
 809.03.4 Reinforcement and Prestressing Steel. Prior to installation in the units, reinforcement and prestressing steel shall be free of rust, frost, dirt, oil, paint, mill scale, corrosion, or any
 foreign material that may prevent bonding between the steel and the concrete, to the satisfaction
 of the Engineer. Prestressing steel that has sustained physical damage at any time shall be
 rejected. The development of pitting or other results of corrosion (other than rust stain) shall be
 cause for rejection, when ordered by the Engineer. Prestressing steel exhibiting rust stains shall
 be examined to determine if pitting exists, prior to its use. Any coil that is found to contain broken
 strands shall be rejected and the coil replaced.
 The splicing of prestressed strands inside the casting form is not permitted. Splicing of
 strands outside the casting form may be allowed only with prior approval of the Engineer. Tack
 welding of bar reinforcement shall not be allowed under any circumstances.
 Placing and fastening of all steel reinforcement shall be in accordance with Subsection
 810.03.4 of these Specifications.
 All prestressing strands shall be tested prior to use. Three, 7-foot samples shall be taken
 for each heat number. The Contractor shall have no claims for compensation in the event his
 work is delayed while waiting approval of the material furnished for testing.
 809.03.5 Tensioning of Prestressing Strands. The prestressing elements shall be tensioned
 to provide the required prestress shown on the Plans and shall conform to the applicable
 requirements of the current edition of P.C.I. Manual 116.
 All the strands of a pretensioned member shall be free from kinks or twists before
 tensioning operations are started. Any unwinding of the strand in excess of one turn, after
 8-73
 
 tensioning operations are begun, shall not be permitted. All strands shall be tensioned to 20
 percent of final jacking force before elongation readings are started, unless otherwise directed
 by the Engineer. The equipment for producing this initial tensioning load shall provide a means
 for accurately measuring the force. When the initial tensioning load is applied by pressure jacks,
 they shall be equipped with a proper gauging system for the initial force.
 The pre-designated initial force shall be applied to each strand. This load shall be the
 starting point for measuring additional tensioning for tension determination by the elongation
 method.
 When comparing theoretical gauge and actual gauge readings, and theoretical
 elongations and actual elongations, the requirements of the current edition of P.C.I. Manual 116
 must be observed.
 The elongation computation shall take into account strand anchorage slippage, horizontal
 movement of abutments, bed shortening and any change in temperature of the prestressing steel
 between tensioning and time when concrete takes its initial set if this change is expected to
 exceed 30OF. The final pretensioning shall not be done at temperatures below 20OF.
 The strands that are draped shall be stressed no higher than required design stress minus
 the stress increase in the strand from forcing it into a draped profile.
 If the strands are tensioned in their draped position, they shall be supported by rollers at
 each point of change in direction. The holdup rollers between members and at the ends of the
 members shall have either bronze bushings or roller bearings that shall be free running and kept
 well lubricated. Rollers at the hold-down points shall be free running and of a type that will
 produce a minimum amount of friction. If the load for a draped strand, as determined by
 elongation measurements, exceeds 5 percent less than that indicated by the jack gauges, the
 strand shall be tensioned from both ends of the bed and the load as computed from the sum of
 elongation at both ends shall agree within 5 percent of that indicated by jack gauges. There shall
 be no more than three beams cast in the same line at the same time.
 It is anticipated that there may be a discrepancy in indicated stress between jack gauge
 pressure and elongation. In such event, the load used shall produce a slight overstress rather
 than understress. When a discrepancy between gauge and elongation measurements of more
 than 5 percent occurs, the entire operation shall be carefully checked and the source of error
 determined and corrected before proceeding further. The use of a load cell may be required by
 the Engineer to check the applied load. The load cell shall be calibrated at least once every 6
 months or whenever it is deemed necessary by the Engineer.
 Prestressing steel strands in pretensioned members, if tensioned individually or in groups
 (i.e., more than one), shall be checked by the Contractor for loss of prestress not more than 3
 hours prior to placing concrete. The method and equipment for checking the loss of prestress
 shall be subject to approval by the Engineer. All strands that show a relaxation loss of prestress
 in excess of 3 percent shall be retensioned to the designed final jacking force.
 When stressing grouped strands simultaneously, each tendon must first be brought to
 initial tensioning load. The final tensioning load may be applied to the group using a procedure
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 8-74
 
 During tensioning of any one strand, the process shall be so conducted that the applied
 load and the elongation of the strand may be measured at all times.
 Any prestressed strand which has been tensioned for over 48 hours without the placement
 of concrete must be checked for elongation or loss of stress before placing of concrete. If losses
 occur the strands shall be detensioned and then retensioned in accordance with the design
 loading requirements.
 809.03.6 Handling and Placing Concrete. No concrete shall be placed without the Engineer's
 approval. Concrete shall be handled and placed in accordance with the applicable requirements
 of SECTIONS 601 and 808; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE and CAST-IN-PLACE
 STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY, respectively.
 Suitable means shall be used for conveying and placing concrete without segregation. The
 concrete mixture shall not be dropped from a height greater than one foot above the top of the
 forms. Special care shall be taken to deposit the concrete in its final position in each part of the
 form.
 The fresh concrete shall be consolidated in place by internal vibration and, if necessary,
 also by external vibration. The vibrators shall be of a type and design approved by the Engineer
 and the size of the vibrating head will be governed by the spacing of the prestressing and
 reinforcement. Handheld vibrators shall be equipped with rubber tipped heads when used to
 consolidate around epoxy-coated reinforcement. Vibrators shall be used only to consolidate the
 concrete after it has been properly placed and shall not be used for moving concrete along the
 forms.
 The Contractor is responsible for the proper vibration and consolidation of concrete. Only
 properly trained personnel shall be used in the placing and finishing operations.
 809.03.7 Finishing. After all the concrete has been placed and thoroughly compacted as
 required under Subsection; 809.03.6, above, the tops of units shall be magnesium-float finished,
 unless specified otherwise. To assure production of well-formed concrete elements with an
 overall pleasing appearance, all surfaces of concrete shall be true and even, free from rough,
 open or honeycombed areas, depressions, air pockets or projections. All exposed surfaces shall
 be finished by bagging or as otherwise indicated. In addition, special care and effort shall be
 taken when finishing all fascia portions of concrete elements.
 809.03.8 Curing.
 a. Moist Curing System. Precast/prestressed concrete elements shall be cured by a
 moist curing system. Steam curing for precast/prestressed elements shall conform to the
 following provisions:
 1. After placement of the concrete, elements shall be held for a minimum 4-hour
 pre-steaming period. If the ambient air temperature is below 50OF, steam shall be applied during
 the pre-steaming period to hold the air surrounding the element at a temperature between 50OF
 and 90OF.
 2. To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces during the pre-steaming period,
 elements shall be covered as soon as possible after casting or the exposed surfaces shall be
 kept wet by fog spray or by wet blankets.
 8-75
 
 3. Enclosures for steam curing shall allow free circulation of steam about the element and
 shall be constructed to contain the live steam with a minimum moisture loss. The use of
 tarpaulins or similar flexible covers will be permitted, provided they are kept in good condition and
 secured in such a manner to prevent the loss of steam and moisture.
 4. Steam at the jets shall be low pressure and in a saturated condition. Steam jets shall
 not impinge directly on the concrete, test cylinders, or forms. During application of the steam the
 temperature rise within the enclosure shall not exceed 40OF per hour. The curing temperature
 throughout the enclosure shall not exceed 150OF and shall be maintained at a constant level for
 a sufficient time necessary to develop the required transfer strength. Control cylinders shall be
 covered to prevent moisture loss and shall be placed in a location where the temperature is
 representative of the average temperature of the enclosure.
 5. Calibrated temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous
 permanent record of the curing temperature shall be provided. A minimum of one temperature
 recording device per 100 feet of continuous bed length and not less than two per bed, one at
 each end will be required for checking temperature.
 6. Once minimum transfer compressive strength is achieved, members in tension shall
 be detensioned immediately after the termination of steam curing while the concrete and forms
 are still warm or the temperature under the enclosure shall be maintained above 60OF until the
 stress is transferred to the concrete.
 7. Initial curing of precast concrete will be considered complete once the minimum
 specified transfer strength is verified by compressive strength cylinder test results.
 8. Radiant heat may be applied by means of pipes circulating steam, hot water or oil, or
 by electric heating elements. Radiant heat curing shall be done under a suitable enclosure to
 contain the heat and moisture and minimize losses by covering all exposed concrete surfaces
 with plastic sheeting.
 b. Other Curing Methods. If the Contractor proposes to cure the elements by any other
 special method it must be submitted in detail to the Engineer for approval.
 809.03.9 Testing.
 a. General. All materials required for testing shall be furnished by the Contractor at his
 own expense. Samples shall be taken by the Engineer except where contractual restrictions are
 present in which case sampling shall be witnessed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall have
 no claims for compensation in the event his work is delayed while waiting approval of the
 materials furnished for testing.
 b. Process Control Testing. Process Control Testing of concrete is a mandatory
 requirement and shall conform to the following Special Provisions:
 1. Cylinder specimens for form stripping, detensioning, and shipping will be cast by the
 Contractor and shall be cured and tested in accordance with procedures outlined in SECTION
 601; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE, of these Specifications. All test cylinders shall be 6
 inches in diameter by 12 inches high. When the nominal size of the coarse aggregate in the mix
 does not exceed 1 inch, the Engineer may direct the use of 4" x 8" cylinder specimens for
 compressive strength verification. When a 4" x 8" cylinder specimen is used. a 0.95 adjustment
 8-76
 
 factor shall be applied to the compressive strength test result obtained. This adjusted
 compressive strength shall be equal to or greater than the minimum compressive strength
 specified for the standard (6" x 12") cylinder specimens. The Contractor shall cast a sufficient
 number of concrete test cylinders to insure that enough specimens are available to determine the
 necessary strength test requirements. The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing the
 cylinder molds for all compressive test specimens. Steel molds will be required for high
 temperature curing (in excess of 120OF) and plastic molds for all the rest.
 2. Process control cylinders shall be cast and tested in the presence of the Engineer. The
 Engineer shall be the sole judge of which cylinders are suitable and shall place his mark and date
 cast thereon.
 3. All cylinders shall be placed within 15 feet of each end of the casting bed or as
 determined by the Engineer.
 One cylinder from each location shall be tested in immediate succession to verify form
 stripping (precast), transfer (prestressed) and 28-day strengths (shipping).
 All cylinders must exceed the minimum strength required for form stripping (precast),
 transfer (prestressed) and 28-day strengths (shipping), respectively.
 Each structure shall not be shipped from the plant to the project site unless it has cured
 for seven days at the plant and obtained the minimum 28-day compressive strength.
 If the requirement is not met, any remaining cylinders representing the deficient location
 shall be tested. If the replacement cylinder reaches the minimum required strength that result
 shall supersede the previous result. Any remaining test cylinders shall be handled and cured
 according to AASHTO Specifications.
 c. Acceptance Testing. Acceptance testing is defined in Subsection 601.03.7; Testing
 of Concrete, and shall be the methodology for "Acceptance" of all concrete elements.
 809.03.10 Transfer of Prestress. Transfer of prestress shall be accomplished in the presence
 of the Engineer and in accordance with the approved detensioning schedule and as soon as the
 transfer strength is achieved and verified. The detensioning schedule must consist of, but not
 be limited to, the following:
 1. The order of detensioning, and;
 2.
 
 Each strand must be detensioned at each end and/or between each element.
 
 At the end of each prestressed element the concrete surrounding the individual strands
 will be chipped back to sound material to a depth of between 3/4-inch to 1 inch. The strands
 themselves will be cut back to the same depth. The edges shall be squared off so as not to
 produce a "feathered" edge. Cleaning shall be by wire brushing or abrasive sand blasting to
 remove all dirt and residue that is not firmly bonded to the metal or concrete surfaces. The
 ensuing void including the end of the strand shall be filled with an approved non-shrink grout
 whose surface will be finished flush with that of the plane surface of the product.
 809.03.11 Handling. All products shall be removed from the forms in the presence of the
 Engineer. Adequate notice shall be given to the Engineer so that he may witness the removal
 8-77
 
 operation. Extreme care shall be exercised in handling and moving precast/prestressed concrete
 members. Precast girders and slabs shall be transported in an upright position and the points
 of support and direction of the reactions with respect to the member shall be approximately the
 same during transportation and storage as when the member is in its final position.
 The location of all dunnage and pick-up points shall be as indicated on the Shop Drawings
 unless otherwise as directed by the Engineer.
 Care shall be taken during storage, hoisting and handling of the precast units to prevent
 cracking or damage. Units damaged by improper storage or handling shall be replaced or
 repaired at the Contractor's expense subject to approval by the Engineer.
 809.03.12 Rejection of Units. Any unit not fabricated in accordance with the Contract
 Documents, Plans, or approved shop drawings shall be subject to rejection by the Engineer.
 The Engineer shall make a preliminary determination as to whether spalled, cracked,
 honeycombed, or otherwise defective concrete shall be repaired or be subject to rejection. In the
 event that the unit is to be repaired, the Contractor must submit a detailed non-conformance
 report and a detailed repair procedure to the Engineer for approval prior to commencement of
 repair work.
 All repair work must be performed at the cost of the Contractor in the presence of the
 Engineer. Any repair work not done in the presence of the Engineer will not be accepted.
 The repaired unit shall then be reinspected for approval by the Engineer.

 coating and shall be inert in concrete. The material shall be supplied by the epoxy resin
 manufacturer, and it must be suitable for repairs made by the installation contractor on areas
 damaged during fabrication or handling in the field.
 3. Basis of Acceptance for Coated Bars. The coating applicator shall furnish
 Certificates of Compliance with each shipment of coated bars. The Certificate of Compliance
 shall state that the coated bars conform to the requirements of this Specification and those of
 relevant ASTM Specifications.
 
 8-79
 
 810.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 810.03.1 Bar Schedules and Bending Diagrams. The bar schedules and bending diagrams
 shown on the Plans are furnished for informational purposes only, and the State does not assume
 responsibility for their accuracy. The Contractor's bar fabricator shall verify the accuracy prior to
 preparing order lists and bending diagrams. Any expense incurred in revising the State's bar
 schedules and bending diagrams in order that they comply with the design drawings shall be
 borne by the Contractor at no additional cost to the State.
 810.03.2 Test Bars. The schedule of bars shown on the Plans shall include extra bars for field
 sampling, for supplementary analyses; and for weight, tensile and bending tests. In general, one
 bar of a length sufficient for two samples each, 30 inches long, shall be furnished for testing for
 each 15 tons or less for a given size bar.
 If tests results do not reasonably conform to previous reports or do not conform to the
 minimum requirements of tensile and bending properties, those portions of the shipments
 affected will be rejected. However, the Contractor will be entitled to two additional tests of other
 bars in the same lot for each failed test, and if acceptable results are obtained from both, the
 material may be accepted. Any material unsuited for use because of inaccuracies in bending,
 or other properties which render it unfit shall be rejected.
 The weight of test specimens shall be primarily used in calculations to determine the
 effective area for tensile tests. If the weight of test specimens exceeds the permissible lot
 variation from theoretical weights as specified in ASTM A615, sufficient material shall be weighed
 to produce a reliable determination of effective area. The Contractor shall provide for the required
 handling without extra compensation.
 810.03.3 Fabrication and Delivery.
 a. Bar Reinforcement. Bent bar reinforcement shall be cold bent to the shapes shown
 on the Plans. Bars partially embedded in concrete shall not be field bent except as shown on the

 approval of the Engineer. Unless otherwise specified, the concrete shall be placed as a
 monolithic unit in a continuous operation between joints.
 a. Consolidation. The concrete shall be consolidated by means of an approved high
 frequency internal vibrator which shall be applied in a manner to secure maximum consolidation
 of the concrete. Consolidation shall leave the concrete free from voids and insure a dense
 surface texture, but not be continued so long as to cause segregation or bleeding. A small
 uniform quantity of concrete shall be maintained ahead of the screed on each pass. At no time
 shall the quantity of concrete carried ahead of the screed be so great as to cause slipping or
 lifting.
 In the case where the vibratory action of the finishing machine does not provide consolidation in accordance with the rate of placement, the Contractor shall have in reserve at all times
 sufficient vibration equipment to guard against shutdown of the work. The Contractor shall take
 preventive measures to insure that the epoxy coated reinforcement is not susceptible to damage
 by the vibrators.
 814.03.7 Finishing. Methods, procedures, and equipment shall be used which will insure a
 uniform riding surface without over-vibration or segregation of the components of the concrete.
 8-97
 
 The leading edge of freshly placed concrete shall at all times be maintained approximately
 parallel to the finishing machine.
 Self-propelled finishing machines will be required unless specifically noted otherwise on
 the Plans or in the Special Provisions.
 a. Finishing Machine. An approved self-propelled finishing machine(s) will be required
 for consolidating, striking off and finishing the concrete deck surface. The finishing machine(s)
 shall be of sufficient width to finish the full width of the deck. The weight of the finishing
 machine(s) shall not cause unaccounted for deflection of the bridge members or falsework. The
 machine shall travel on steel rails, pipe or other approved grade control, which shall be supported
 by vertical supports securely fastened in place at a maximum spacing of 2 feet to prevent any
 appreciable deflection between rail supports. Prior to placing the concrete, screed rails shall be
 completely in place, and accurately set to insure finishing of the concrete deck surface to the
 elevations shown on the Plans. The supports for the rails, if embedded in the deck concrete,
 shall be of the type which can be removed without disturbing the concrete. Screed rails shall not
 be treated with parting compound to facilitate their removal. Rails for finishing machines shall
 extend beyond both ends of the scheduled length for concrete placement. The extended length
 shall be of sufficient distance to allow finishing machine(s) to clear the concrete to be placed.
 The finishing machine shall be capable of propelling itself both forward and backward to
 enable repeated passes to be made in order to correct surface irregularities and to produce a
 surface which conforms to the required profile grade, cross-section and surface smoothness. A
 maximum of two passes of the machine will be allowed over any given deck area.
 The finishing machine(s) shall be operated over the full length of the bridge segment to
 be finished prior to beginning of concreting operations. The test run shall be made with screed
 adjusted to its finishing position. During the test run, checks shall be made of the deflection due
 to the finishing machine, adjustment of guide rails and required covers for slab reinforcement.
 The required concrete cover over the top bars shall be checked by riding the screed over the bars
 and measuring the cover over the slab reinforcement. Discrepancies so found, which are in
 excess of the tolerances given on the Plans, shall be rectified to secure the required concrete
 cover. All necessary corrections shall be made before concreting is begun.
 Concrete placement and initial strike-off shall be coordinated so that initial strike-off is
 never more than 10 feet behind the concrete placement. Sufficient depth checks shall be made
 behind the machine(s) and along the full length of the span to insure achievement of the required
 section and reinforcement cover. The direction of placing the concrete shall be as specified on
 the Plans.
 On skewed bridge decks, the placement of the concrete and the operation of the finishing
 machine should parallel the skew angle.
 Improper adjustment or operation of the finishing machine which results in inadequate
 reinforcement cover or smoothness shall be corrected immediately. Unsatisfactory performance,
 particularly with respect to the surface smoothness attained, may be cause for rejection of the
 equipment.
 
 8-98
 
 b. Work Bridge. An adequate number of work bridges shall be provided by the
 Contractor in order to permit access to the surface of the deck for the purpose of finishing,
 straight-edging, making corrections, and setting curing materials. Workmen will not be permitted
 to walk in the fresh concrete after it has been screeded. All finishing work, including application
 of the fog spray and placement of curing mats, shall be performed from bridges supported above
 the deck surface.
 c. Tolerances. Verification of the completed surface of the deck, in accordance with the
 grades and cross slope specified on the contract drawings, shall be made during placement and
 again after the deck has been cured. When the concrete is still plastic, the deck surface shall be
 tested with a ten-foot straight-edge and any variance in excess of 1/8-inch in 10 feet shall be
 corrected immediately. In the event that this tolerance is not met when tested after the concrete
 has hardened, variance in excess of 1/8-inch in 10 feet shall be corrected at the Contractor's
 expense in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 814.03.8 Curing. In the Placement and Curing Plan, the Contractor shall include the curing
 details for achieving the curing of the concrete as required by these Specifications.
 a. Detailed Plan. The detailed plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
 1. Curing method.
 2. Provisions for enclosures, indicating method of holding down enclosure safely in place.
 3. Heat devices, types and location around structure.
 4. Method of monitoring temperature of hardened concrete.
 5. Backup systems as required.
 b. Curing Operations. Immediately following the finishing operation, the application of
 a water fog spray, shall begin and shall be applied continuously, rather than intermittently, until
 such time as moist covers are placed on the concrete surface. Fog spraying shall continue as
 required to provide a continuous supply of moisture to maintain a thoroughly moist concrete
 surface. As soon as concrete finishing operations are completed the Contractor shall promptly
 cover the newly placed concrete surface with a single layer of clean, heavy duty water saturated
 burlap conforming to the requirements of Subsection M.02.04.1 of these Specifications. Burlap
 shall be free from cuts, tears, uneven weaving and contaminants. The burlap shall be placed
 such that the edges are lapped a minimum of 6 inches. A 4 mil clear or white polyethylene sheet
 conforming to Subsection M.02.04.2 shall be placed over the saturated burlap cover.
 White plastic coated fiber blankets conforming to the requirements of Subsection
 M.02.04.2 may be used. Placement requirements must conform with the burlap edge lapping
 specification.
 Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, the application of curing compounds in lieu
 of fog spray and moist cure process shall not be allowed when membranes or overlays are
 specified.
 
 8-99
 
 All concrete shall be kept continuously moist and protected against any drying for a
 minimum period of 7 consecutive days after placement of concrete. The burlap covers shall be
 kept moist for the entire 7-day curing period, and under no circumstances shall the concrete be
 allowed to be exposed to an alternating wet and dry condition.
 If at any time during the curing period the surface of the concrete deck is judged to be
 losing excessive moisture so as to adversely effect the curing process, the Engineer may require
 that the polyethylene sheets be removed and the coverings be saturated. The Contractor shall
 then recover the saturated coverings with polyethylene sheets.
 In the event that forms or sections of forms have been loosened and/or removed in
 advance of the curing period, the exposed concrete surface shall be immediately covered with
 saturated curing covers and kept saturated for the remainder of the curing period.
 c. Falling Temperatures. When the air temperature is expected to fall below 35OF, the
 Contractor shall provide suitable measures to maintain the concrete surface temperature between
 50OF and 85OF which shall be monitored by a continuously recording thermometer. The minimum
 50OF temperature requirement shall be continuously maintained around the forms and deposited
 concrete for the entire curing period of the first 7 days.
 If the concrete surface temperature falls below 45OF during the first 7 days of the curing
 period, the structure shall be enclosed and external heat shall be provided as directed by the
 Engineer. If external heat is required, the following shall apply:
 1. The time required for tenting shall not be counted as curing time.
 2. External heat shall be maintained on the structure for the entire seven-day curing
 period and then reduced gradually such that the uniform change in temperature does not exceed
 5OF in one hour or 50OF in any 24-hour period.
 Removal of forms shall be as specified in Subsection 808.03.10 of these Specifications.
 If at any time during the curing period the concrete surface temperature falls below 35OF,
 the concrete may be considered as being unsatisfactory and rejected.
 Adequate precautions shall be taken to protect the concrete deck from any damages
 resulting from severe weather conditions during the curing process.
 a. Curing of Acceptance and Process Control Test Cylinders. All test cylinders will
 be field cured with the concrete deck under identical curing conditions.
 814.03.9 Grooving. Unless otherwise shown on the Plans, the final finish required shall be as
 follows:
 a. Bridge Decks with Exposed Concrete Surfaces. The final concrete surface shall
 be textured by transverse grooving. Transverse grooving shall not begin until the concrete has
 adequately met the curing and strength requirements listed under Application of External
 Loads. Grooving shall be done utilizing diamond blades, mounted on a multi-blade arbor on a
 self-propelled machine which has been built for grooving of pavements. The groover shall have
 a depth control device which will detect variations in the pavement surface and adjust the cutting
 8-100
 
 head height to maintain the depth of the groove specified. The grooving machine will be provided
 with devices to control alignment. Flailing type grooving which is uncontrolled and erratic will not
 be permitted. The Contractor shall provide an experienced technician to supervise the location
 alignment, layout, dimension, and grooving of the pavement.
 Grooves shall be transverse (perpendicular) to the pavement centerline. Continuous, noninterrupted transverse grooving shall begin and end 2 feet from the curb lines.
 Grooves shall be 1/4-inch deep with a tolerance of plus or minus 1/16-inch. The width of
 grooves shall be 1/8-inch. The spacing of grooves shall be 1½-inches with a tolerance of plus
 or minus 1/8-inch.
 Grooves shall not be cut closer than 1 foot from any device cast or embedded into the
 deck surface, such as scupper castings, and deck joint materials or hardware.
 At the beginning of each work shift, all machines shall be equipped with a full complement
 of grooving blades that are capable of cutting grooves of the specified width, depth and spacing.
 The removal of all slurry or residue resulting from the grooving operation shall be
 continuous. Pavement must be immediately left in a washed, clean condition, free of all
 slipperiness from the slurry, etc. Residue from grooving operations should not be permitted to
 flow into gutters or other drainage facilities. Solid residue, resulting from grooving operations,
 should be removed from the pavement surfaces before such residue becomes airborne by the
 wind.
 b. Bridge Decks with a Modified Structural Concrete Overlay. The initial concrete
 surface shall be screeded to the true cross section and left without any projections and/or the
 depressions that could retain water. Mixing, handling, placement finishing and curing of the
 modified structural concrete shall conform to the applicable requirements of SECTION 815;
 LATEX MODIFIED CONCRETE FOR BRIDGE DECK OVERLAYS and SECTION 816;
 CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK OVERLAYS, of these Specifications. However, pouring may not
 begin until the concrete bridge deck has obtained the required curing and strength gain set forth
 below in Subsection 814.03.10; Application of External Loads. Transverse grooving is
 required and it shall conform to the requirements listed under Subsection 814.03.9, Para. a,
 above.
 c. Bridge Decks with Bituminous Overlay and Bridge Deck Waterproofing.
 Bituminous paving shall not begin until the concrete has adequately cured and attained the
 required strength as listed under Application of External Loads. The surface of the concrete
 bridge deck shall be left without any projections that might puncture, or depressions that could
 retain water. The surface shall be as smooth as practical in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer of the waterproofing membrane. Requirements of waterproofing the
 bridge deck shall conform with the requirements set forth in SECTION 813; WATERPROOFING
 AND DAMPPROOFING, of these Specifications.
 814.03.10 Application of External Loads. No construction work (including placement of
 sidewalk, curbing, railing, bituminous pavement, concrete overlays, grooving, etc.), shall be
 allowed on the newly placed bridge deck until concrete has cured for a minimum of 28 days and
 has attained the minimum required 28-day compressive strength. No heavy equipment or traffic
 of any description will be permitted on the concrete deck until authorized by the Engineer.
 8-101
 
 814.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. This work will not be measured separately for payment.
 814.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. No separate payment will be made for this work. Rather,
 payment will be included with the payment, and at the contract unit price per cubic yard as listed
 in the Proposal, for "Concrete Superstructure Class HP(AE) Bridge Deck."

 SECTION 816
 CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK OVERLAYS
 816.01 DESCRIPTION. This work consists of placing a Portland cement concrete overlay on
 a prepared surface of bridge decks, precast concrete butted box beams, deck slabs, deck planks
 or other specified concrete substrate at the locations indicated on the Plans or as directed by the
 Engineer, all in accordance with these Specifications.
 816.02 MATERIALS. Portland cement concrete shall be Class HP(AE) and shall conform to all
 applicable requirements of SECTION 601; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE, of these
 Specifications, except as modified herein.
 816.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 816.03.1 Existing Bridge Decks.
 a. Surface Scarification. The surfaces of existing bridge decks upon which a concrete
 overlay is to be placed shall be scarified in an approved manner. The scarification method and
 depth of removal shall be as specified on the Plans.
 b. Surface Preparation. The blast-cleaning of an area of the deck shall be performed
 before the 24-hour water soak period preceding placement of the overlay on the area. The blastcleaning shall be performed by a method approved by the Engineer. The blast-cleaning method
 used shall be performed in conformance with all applicable air and water pollution regulations and
 applicable safety and health regulations. All debris, including dirty water, resulting from the blastcleaning operations shall be immediately and thoroughly cleaned from the blast-cleaned surfaces
 and from other areas where debris may have accumulated. All dust and other debris shall be
 removed by flushing with water, vacuuming, or blowing with oil-free compressed air. The blastcleaned areas shall be protected, as necessary, against contamination prior to the 24-hour
 presoaking. Contaminated areas and areas exposed more than 36 hours after cleaning shall be
 blast-cleaned again, as directed by the Engineer and at no additional expense to the State.
 The prepared surface shall then be soaked with clean water for not less than 24 hours
 prior to the placement of the Class HP(AE) concrete overlay. The surface shall be maintained
 in a clean, saturated condition by using polyethylene film or other suitable water impermeable
 clear covers, until ready to receive the overlay. Before the overlay is applied, all standing water
 shall be blown off with oil-free compressed air.
 816.03.2 Precast Concrete Butted Box Beams, Deck Slabs, or Deck Beams. The surfaces
 of Precast Concrete Butted Box Beams, Deck Slabs or Deck Planks upon which an overlay is to
 be applied shall be finished with a roughened surface with amplitude of 1/4" minimum by a
 method noted on the Plans or as approved by the Engineer.
 After the placement and curing of the shear key grout and successful post tensioning
 of the structural elements is complete, and prior to placing the overlay, the entire area of the
 deck shall be blast-cleaned in accordance with the requirements set forth in Subsection
 8-106
 
 816.03.1, Para. b. Epoxy coated steel and any other appurtenances cast into the surface of
 the precast elements shall be protected from the effect of the blast medium so that damage
 to the epoxy coating does not occur. Any damage resulting from the Contractor’s failure to
 adequately protect the steel shall be repaired by the Contractor at no additional cost to the
 State.
 816.03.3 Bonding Grout. When specified in the Plans, a bonding grout shall be applied as
 follows: After the surface has been cleaned and wetted, and immediately before placing concrete,
 a thin (approximately 1/8 inch) coating of bonding grout shall be vigorously and thoroughly
 broomed, brushed or sprayed onto the saturated bridge deck.
 Bonding grout shall consist of equal parts, by volume, of approved Portland cement,
 microsilica (solids part) and mortar sand with sufficient water to form a slurry. The water-tocementitious ratio by weight of the bonding grout slurry shall not exceed 0.40. The consistency
 of the slurry shall be such that it can be applied with a stiff synthetic bristle broom or sprayed onto
 the prepared concrete surface in a thin, even coating that will not run or puddle.
 Bonding grout that has dried or become unworkable, as determined by the Engineer, shall
 not be incorporated in the work. No retempering will be permitted.
 Bonding grout shall be broomed with push brooms. At all joints and concrete surfaces
 around or below reinforcing steel, brooming shall be done with straight brooms. Care shall be
 exercised to insure that all prepared surface areas receive a thoroughly even coating, and that
 no excess bonding grout be permitted to collect in pockets. This shall be done to insure the
 bonding grout is evenly absorbed into the surface. All surfaces to be in contact with new
 concrete, including the slab, curb, longitudinal and transverse joints, shall be coated with bonding
 grout.
 The rate of bonding grout application shall be limited to that surface area which can be
 covered with new concrete before the bonding grout begins to dry out. The application of the
 bonding grout shall not be more than 5 feet from the leading edge of the overlay. The
 Contractor shall take measures to insure that no drying out of the bonding grout occurs by having
 sufficient workmen available. In the event drying does occur, as evidenced by a light gray color,
 the Contractor shall remove the bonding grout by sandblasting, or other means approved by
 the Engineer. Wetting or spraying the wet or dry bonding grout shall not be allowed.
 816.03.4 Limitations of Mixing.
 a. Temperature and Weather Conditions. All weather and concrete temperature
 requirements shall meet the applicable requirements of Subsection 814.03.3 of these
 Specifications except as modified below.
 b. Cold Weather Concrete. No Class HP(AE) concrete mixtures shall be placed when
 ambient temperatures are below 45OF. However, the Class HP(AE) concrete may be placed at
 45OF when rising temperatures are forecast and if the forecast indicates temperatures over 45OF
 for a minimum period of 8 hours after the placement has been completed.
 
 8-107
 
 If the air temperatures are such that the minimum temperature will not be met, the
 Contractor may place concrete if the structure is enclosed and external heat is provided in order
 to meet specified ambient temperature requirement for placement.
 At temperatures above 85OF the Engineer may require placements to be made at night
 or early morning hours, if, in his opinion, a satisfactory surface finish is not being achieved.
 c. Inclement Weather. For structures that are not enclosed, all placing operations shall
 cease when it starts to rain or snow.
 816.03.5 Placing and Finishing. Class HP(AE) concrete overlay shall conform to the
 placement requirements of Subsection 814.03.6 of these Specifications except as modified
 herein. Concrete placement shall not proceed until the Engineer is satisfied that all necessary
 steps have been taken to insure adequate compliance with the Specifications and that completion
 of the operation can be accomplished within the required scheduled time. It shall be the
 Contractor's responsibility to allow sufficient time to permit such an inspection by the Engineer.
 a. Finishing Machine. The finishing machine shall conform to the applicable
 requirements of Subsection 814.03.7 of these Specifications, except as modified in this Section.
 The finishing machine shall have one or more rotating rollers and augers. Prior to placing the
 concrete, screed rails shall be accurately set to insure finishing of the concrete surface to the
 elevations shown on the Plans.
 Provisions shall be made for raising the screed to clear the screeded surface for traveling
 in reverse. The bottom face of the screed shall be a metal surface 4 inches wide. The screeds
 shall be provided with positive control of the vertical position.
 During the dry test run the finishing machine's screed rails are to be set as close to the
 final grade as possible to eliminate the need for adjusting the finishing machine by hand at any
 time during the operation.
 Bulkheads shall be formed to the required grade and profile prior to placing the modified
 concrete overlay.
 b. Placement and Consolidation. Concrete placement and initial strike-off shall be
 coordinated so that initial strike-off is never more than 5 feet behind the concrete placement. The
 direction of placing the concrete shall be as specified on the Plans.
 The concrete shall be consolidated by means of an approved high frequency (3000 to
 7000 vpm) vibratory pan which shall be applied in a manner to secure maximum consolidation
 of the concrete.
 Spud vibration will be required in deep pockets, edges and adjacent to joint bulkheads and
 overlays greater than 3 inches thick.
 Handheld vibrators shall be equipped with rubber-tipped heads when used to consolidate
 around epoxy-coated reinforcement.
 A construction dam or bulkhead shall be installed in case of a delay in the placement
 operations exceeding 30 minutes duration. During delays of 30 minutes or less, the placement
 8-108
 
 shall be protected with presoaked wet burlap. If the concrete placement is stopped or delayed
 for 90 minutes or more, further placement shall be discontinued.
 The thickness of the mixture shall be verified by probes in the fresh concrete. Sufficient
 depth checks shall be made at regular intervals behind the machine(s) prior to commencement
 of the curing operation along the full width of the span to insure conformity to the overlay
 thickness specified on the Plans.
 Screed rails and/or construction bulkheads shall be separated from the newly placed
 material by passing a pointed trowel along their inside face. Metal expansion dams shall not be
 separated from the overlayment. Care shall be exercised to insure that this trowel cut is made
 for the entire depth and length of rails after the mixture has sufficiently stiffened.
 Unsatisfactory performance, particularly with respect to the surface smoothness and
 profile attained, may be cause for rejection of the equipment.
 c. Finishing. The finished surface, before texturing, shall be uniformly smooth, dense
 and even. Variations in pavement surface in excess of 1/8-inch above, or below the proper
 finished elevation, or surface irregularities of more than 1/8-inch in 10 feet will not be accepted.
 The concrete surface shall be checked in accordance with the requirements of Para. c of
 Subsection 814.03.7 of these Specifications.
 Hand finishing with a float may be required along the edge of the pour or on small areas
 or repair. Edge tooling is required at joints, except next to metal expansion dams, curbs, and

 817.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 817.03.1 Surface Preparation (All Repair Methods). All deteriorated soft or honeycombed
 concrete shall be removed from the areas to be repaired by means of suitable power and hand
 tools to a uniform depth, sufficient to expose a bonding surface of sound material. Power tools
 that cause over-breakage of concrete will not be allowed. Chipping hammers shall weigh less
 than 40 pounds. In areas where reinforcing steel is found to be surrounded by deteriorated
 concrete or where at least one-half of the rebar surface area is exposed, the depth of concrete
 removal shall be such as to include all deteriorated concrete but not less than that depth
 necessary to allow for one inch minimum annular clearance around the reinforcing bars. All
 corroded reinforcing bars shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove all rust. Those bars that have
 lost 1/4 or more of their original diameter shall be supplemented by new bars spliced in place.
 New bars considered main reinforcement, shall be lapped sufficiently (30 diameters on both sides
 of the effected areas) to develop the full strength of the bar. If necessary, additional chipping will
 be required to provide this lap. Dual bars of equivalent or greater section may be used.
 8-111
 
 The boundaries of areas to be repaired shall be square cut, or slightly undercut to a depth
 of not less than one inch. Thin or feathered edges will not be permitted.
 All chipped areas, corroded rebars and masonry surfaces to be repaired shall be
 thoroughly cleaned by means of compressed air, sandblasting, air and waterblasting, steam, wire
 brushing or by other methods approved by the Engineer. The Contractor may use one or all of
 the various means of cleaning chipped areas as approved or as ordered by the Engineer.
 Care shall be taken during the removal of the designated portions of the structure to avoid
 damaging the portions that are to remain in place. Any damage caused by the Contractor to the
 existing structure that is designated to remain in place shall be repaired or replaced by the
 Contractor at its own expense to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 The surface against which mortar is to be placed shall be kept wet for at least one hour
 and then allowed to dry to a saturated surface dry condition just prior to application of the mortar.
 817.03.2 Placement of Reinforcing. Repairs less than 1½-inches thick will not require wire
 mesh reinforcement unless otherwise specified by the Engineer. In cases where the thickness
 of the repair mortar exceeds 1½-inches and existing bar reinforcement is available, galvanized
 wire mesh shall be attached to the bars with tie wire. If existing rebar is not available, wire mesh
 shall be installed by means of mechanical concrete anchors in accordance with the requirements
 of Table 1. For areas where the repair exceeds 4 inches, a single layer of wire mesh shall be
 used to reinforce each 2-inch thickness of patch material.

 engaging reinforcement. At least three anchors shall be used in each individual patch area.
 If any reinforcement is damaged by the Contractor during the repair procedure, the bars
 shall be replaced as required by the Engineer at the Contractor's expense.
 817.03.3 Application of Pneumatically Applied Mortar (Shotcrete).
 a. Submittals. Submittal shall include shop drawings, details, material and mill test
 certificates, mix designs, staff qualifications, construction procedures, detailed construction
 sequencing plans, and shop drawings for temporary debris shields. Shop drawing shall be
 8-112
 
 submitted a minimum of 21 calendar days prior to the commencement of the work.
 The Contractor shall submit documentation showing that project personnel have
 appropriate qualifications. Inadequate proof of personnel qualifications shall be cause for
 withholding construction approval. Changes to previously approved personnel must be approved
 in writing. Shotcreting nozzle operators shall have at least one year of experience in the
 application of shotcrete on projects of comparable nature or work under the immediate
 supervision of foreman or instructor with at least two years of such experience.
 The Engineer shall approve or reject the Contractor's working drawings, design
 submission, and staff qualifications within ten working days after receipt of the submission. Work
 shall not begin until the Contractor's qualifications are approved. The Engineer may suspend the
 work if the Contractor substitutes unqualified personnel for approved personnel during
 construction. If work is suspended due to the substitution of unqualified personnel, the Contractor
 shall be fully liable for additional costs resulting from the suspension of the work and no
 adjustments in contract time resulting from the suspension will be allowed.
 b. Batching and Mixing. Aggregate and cement may be batched by weight or by
 volume. Mixing equipment shall be capable of thoroughly mixing the materials in sufficient
 quantity to maintain placing continuity. Ready mix shotcrete shall comply with the applicable
 requirements of Subsections 601.03.2 and 601.03.3, respectively, of these Specifications.
 c. Delivery Equipment. The mortar shall be applied by pneumatic equipment that sprays
 the mix onto the prepared surface at a high velocity as needed to produce a compacted dense
 homogeneous mass. The air compressor and delivery hose lines shall be of adequate capacity
 and size to provide a minimum pressure of 35 psi at the nozzle for one-inch nozzles and
 proportionally greater for larger nozzles. The compressor shall be of adequate capacity to
 maintain a sufficient, constant nozzle velocity for all parts of the work while simultaneously
 operating a blow pipe for cleaning away rebound. The air hose shall be equipped with a filter to
 prevent any oil or grease from contaminating the shotcrete. The velocity of the material as it
 leaves the nozzle must be maintained uniform at a rate determined for the given job conditions
 to produce minimum rebound.
 1.
 Dry Mix Process. The delivery equipment shall be capable of delivering a
 continuous, smooth uniformly mixed material to the nozzle. The nozzle shall be equipped with
 a water ring and valve to permit adjustment of the water. The water added to the dry mix at the
 nozzle shall be maintained at a pressure at least 15 psi greater than the air pressure. The nozzle
 shall be capable of delivering a conical discharge stream.
 2. Wet Mix Process. Only pneumatic-feed type delivery equipment will be allowed.
 d. Pre-Construction Testing. Test panels shall be made by each application crew using
 the equipment, materials, mixture proportions and procedures proposed for the job prior to the
 commencement of the work. A test panel at least 30" x 30" shall be made for each mixture being
 considered and for each shooting position to be encountered in the job. The test panels shall be
 fabricated to the same thickness as in the structure, but not less than 4 inches. Take at least five,
 3-inch diameter cores from each panel for testing in accordance with AASHTO T24. Samples
 for testing shall be obtained by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer, and tested by the
 Engineer. Field cure the samples in the same manner as the work, except that the test
 specimens shall be soaked in water for a minimum of 40 hours prior to testing. When the length
 8-113
 
 of the core is less than twice the diameter, apply the correction factors given in AASHTO T24 to
 obtain the compressive strength of individual cores. The average compressive strength of three
 cores taken from the test panel shall equal or exceed 0.85fc' with no individual core less than
 0.75fc'. The average of three cubes taken from a panel of shotcrete must equal or exceed fc' with
 no individual cube less than 0.88fc'.
 e. Placement of Mortar. Shotcrete shall be applied with the same equipment and the
 same technique as used to construct the approved test panels. Nozzle operators constructing
 the test panels are to be the same operators used in placing shotcrete in the work. The mortar
 shall be applied as dry as practicable to prevent shrinkage cracking and preclude sagging or
 sloughing off.
 Shooting guide strips or wires shall be employed to insure square corners, straight lines
 and a plane surface of mortar, except as otherwise specified on the Plans or approved by the
 Engineer. They shall be so placed as to keep the trapping of rebound at a minimum. The re-use
 of rebounded materials will not be permitted. In shooting all surfaces, the stream of flowing
 material from the nozzle shall impinge as nearly as possible at right angles to the surface being
 covered, and the nozzle shall be held from 2 to 4 feet from the working surface. Thickness
 measuring pins shall be installed on 5-foot centers in each direction. The pins shall be noncorrosive. Other methods to establish if the required minimum thickness of shotcrete is being
 applied may be approved if the Contractor can satisfactorily demonstrate the reliability of these
 other methods.
 A sufficient number of mortar coats shall be applied to obtain the required thickness. On
 vertical and overhead surfaces, the thickness of each coat shall not be greater than 1 inch, except
 as approved by the Engineer, and shall be so placed that it will neither sag nor decrease the bond
 of the preceding coat. The time interval between successive layers in sloping, vertical or
 overhanging work, shall be sufficient to allow initial set but not final set to develop. At the time
 initial set is developing, the surface shall be cleaned to remove the thin film of laitance in order
 to provide for a bond with succeeding applications. Rebound or accumulated loose sand shall
 be removed from the surface by brooming or scraping to be covered prior to placing of the original
 or succeeding layers of mortar and shall not be embedded in the work. All laitance which has
 been allowed to take final set must be removed by sandblasting and thoroughly cleaning the
 surfaces.
 Care shall be taken to thoroughly wash down all previously hardened concrete with water
 and compressed air before shooting new material.
 The wire fabric shall be positioned to prevent vibration while the shotcrete is being applied.
 Lap mesh one and a half squares in both directions. Tie wires shall be bent flat in the plane of
 the mesh and not form large knots. A minimum cover of 2 inches of shotcrete shall be required.
 The shotcrete shall be applied from the bottom up to prevent accumulation of rebound on
 the surface still to be covered. Shotcrete shall emerge from the nozzle in a steady uninterrupted
 flow.
 Horizontal and vertical corners and any area where rebound can not escape or be blown
 free shall be filled first. Nozzle shall be held at such distance and angle to place material behind
 reinforcement before material is allowed to accumulate on its face. Do not place shotcrete
 through more than one layer of reinforcing steel rods or mesh in one application. Unless suitable
 8-114
 
 means to screen the nozzle is provided, discontinue shotcreting if wind or air currents will cause
 separation of the stream during placement.
 Check for hollow areas by hammer sounding. An approved method shall be used to
 correct deficient areas. Deficient areas shall be corrected at the Contractor's expense.
 Surface defects shall be repaired as soon as possible after initial placement of the
 shotcrete. All shotcrete which lacks uniformity, exhibits segregation, honeycombing, or
 lamination, or which contains any dry patches, slugs, voids, or sand pockets shall be removed
 and replaced with fresh shotcrete at the Contractor's expense.
 f. Construction Testing. Contractor shall prepare one test panel for every 50 cubic
 yards of shotcrete placed or one panel per shift. Test panel shall have minimum dimensions of
 18" x 18" x 4" gunned in the same position as the work represented. Panels shall be gunned
 during the course of the work by the Contractor's regular nozzleman. The Contractors shall cure
 the panels and obtain a minimum of three cores as described under "Preconstruction Testing.”
 Cut cores shall be tested by the Engineer in accordance with the requirements listed under
 "Preconstruction Testing.”
 g. Limitation of Mixing. Shotcrete shall be placed in accordance with the temperature
 and weather conditions listed under Subsection 814.03.3 of these Specifications.
 h. Finish. All exposed surfaces shall be finished straight and true, approximating the
 original contour as close as practicable. The final finish shall have a steel trowel, wood float or
 other finish approximating the existing adjacent concrete finish.
 i. Curing. Should the placing operations be suspended overnight, the Contractor shall
 maintain the exposed shotcrete surfaces continuously moist until operations are resumed.
 Surfaces shall be kept moist by either continuously sprinkling, or absorptive mat/fabric kept
 continuously wet.
 Immediately upon completion of final shotcreting operations. The Contractor shall
 continue moist curing, as specified above for a period of 7 days after shotcreting. Contractor may
 use an approved curing compound in accordance with the requirements of Subsection M.02.04
 of these Specifications. Curing compounds shall not be used on any surfaces against which
 additional shotcrete or other cementitious finishing materials are to be bonded.
 817.03.4 Application of Patching Mortar.
 a. Limitation of Mixing. Concrete patching mortar shall be mixed and applied in strict
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 b. Placing and Consolidation. Prior to placing the patching mortar, an epoxy bonding
 agent or a Portland cement slurry, as specified on the Plans, shall be applied to all exposed
 reinforcing and mating concrete surfaces.
 The Contractor shall follow the manufacturer's recommendations for curing the epoxy
 bonding agent prior to placing the patching mortar. The patching mortar shall not be placed if the
 epoxy bonding agent has exceeded the manufacturer's recommended contact time. If the epoxy
 bonding agent has exceeded its contact time, the Contractor shall follow the manufacturer's
 8-115
 
 recommendations for re-application. An epoxy bonding agent with an extended contact time
 should be used if required by the timing of concrete placement and/or weather conditions.
 The patching mortar shall not be placed if the Portland cement slurry has dried out.
 Should the Portland cement slurry dry out prior to placing the patching mortar, the Contractor
 shall remove the slurry by sandblasting or other means as approved by the Engineer. Wetting
 or spraying the wet or dry slurry shall not be allowed.
 The patching mortar shall be placed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, otherwise it shall be placed in 1-inch lift layers maximum, within 5-to-10 minutes after
 mixing water is added to avoid the rapid setup of the material.
 If more than one lift layer is required to perform the repair, the previously placed lift layer
 shall not be allowed to dry. Its surface shall be roughened prior to placing the next layer.
 c. Curing and Protection. Curing of the patching mortar shall be in accordance with the
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 d. Final Finish. Repaired surfaces shall be finished to closely match the color and
 original contour of surfaces adjoining the repair areas. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the
 repaired surface does not closely match the adjacent unrepaired surface, the repair shall be
 removed and the repair process repeated or modified as approved by the Engineer. Where
 bulges, offsets, and other irregularities exceed the specified tolerances, the protrusions shall be
 reduced so that the surfaces are within the specified limits. No extra compensation will be
 furnished to the Contractor for any repeated repairs.
 817.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Repairs to Structure Concrete Masonry - Pneumatically Applied Mortar" and "Repairs to Structure Concrete Masonry - Patching Mortar" will be
 measured by the number of cubic feet of the respective mortars actually applied in accordance
 with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 817.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantities of "Repairs to Structure Concrete
 Masonry - Pneumatically Applied Mortar" and "Repairs to Structure Concrete Masonry - Patching
 Mortar" will be paid for at the respective contract unit prices per cubic foot as listed in the
 Proposal. The prices so stated shall constitute full and complete compensation for all labor,
 materials, equipment and scaffolding, and all other incidentals required to finish the work,
 complete and accepted by the Engineer.

 b. Shop. The Engineer shall be notified well in advance of the start of the work in the
 shop, in order that an inspector shall be on hand to inspect material and workmanship.
 The fabricator shall furnish all facilities for inspecting and testing the weight and quality
 of workmanship at the shop where the material is fabricated. Suitable testing equipment, properly
 calibrated, shall be provided.
 
 8-133
 
 When an inspector is furnished by the State to inspect materials at the mills or at the
 shops, full access shall be provided at all times and to all parts of the mills or shops where the
 material is being manufactured or fabricated.
 The inspector shall have the authority to reject any material or work which does not meet
 the requirements of these Specifications. In case of dispute the Contractor may appeal to the
 Engineer, whose decision shall be final.
 The acceptance of any material or finished members by the inspectors shall not be a bar
 to their subsequent rejection, if subsequently found defective. Rejected material and
 workmanship shall be replaced promptly and made good by the Contractor.
 c. Site. The Engineer may waive shop inspection and may make inspection of all
 fabricated material when the same is delivered at the site of the work.
 The Contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a minimum of four copies of shipping
 statements.
 The weights of the individual members shall be shown on the statement.
 The Contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a Certificate of Identification as defined in
 Subsection 11.4.1 of the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (15th Edition).
 d. Delegation of Authority. The State may delegate inspection and testing to an
 independent laboratory or testing company. This agency shall have all the prerogatives as
 previously mentioned for the Engineer except that in the event of a disagreement of substance
 the Contractor may appeal a decision to the Engineer whose decision shall be final.
 824.03.3 Fabrication.
 a. Quality of Workmanship. Workmanship and finish shall be equal to the best general
 practice of modern bridge shops.
 b. Shop Storage of Materials. Structural material, either plain or fabricated, shall be
 stored at the bridge shop above the ground upon platforms, skids, or other supports. It shall be
 kept free from dirt, grease and other foreign matter, and shall be protected as far as practicable
 from corrosion.
 c. Holes for High-Strength Bolts and Unfinished Bolts.
 1. General. All holes for bolts shall be either punched or drilled. Material forming parts
 of a member composed of not more than five thicknesses of metal may be punched 1/16-inch
 larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts whenever the thickness of the material is not greater
 than 3/4-inch for structural steel, 5/8-inch for high-strength steel of ½-inch for quenched and
 tempered alloy steel.
 When there are more than five thicknesses or when any of the main material is thicker
 than 3/4-inch for structural steel, 5/8-inch for high-strength steel, or ½-inch for quenched and
 tempered alloy steel, all holes shall either be subdrilled and reamed or drilled full size.
 
 8-134
 
 When required, all holes shall be either subpunched or subdrilled (subdrilled if thickness
 limitation governs) 3/16-inch smaller and, after assembling, reamed 1/16-inch larger or drilled full
 size to 1/16-inch larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts.
 When shown on the Plans, enlarged or slotted holes are allowed with high-strength bolts.
 2. Punched Holes. The diameter of the die shall not exceed the diameter of the punch
 by more than 1/16-inch. If any holes must be enlarged to admit the bolts, such holes shall be
 reamed. Holes must be clean cut without torn or ragged edges.
 3. Reamed or Drilled Holes. Reamed or drilled holes shall be cylindrical, perpendicular
 to the member, and shall comply with the requirements of Para. c.1, above, as to size. Where
 practical, reamers shall be directed by mechanical means. Burrs on the outside surfaces shall
 be removed. Reaming and drilling shall be done with twist drills, twist reamers or rotobroach
 cutters. Connecting parts requiring reamed or drilled holes shall be assembled and securely held
 while being reamed or drilled and shall be match marked before disassembling.
 4. Accuracy of Holes. Holes not more than 1/32-inch larger in diameter than the true
 decimal equivalent of the nominal diameter that may result from a drill or reamer of the nominal
 diameter are considered acceptable, the slightly conical hole that naturally results from punching
 operations is considered acceptable. The width of slotted holes which are produced by flame
 cutting or a combination of drilling or punching and flame cutting shall generally be not more than
 1/32-inch greater than the nominal width. The flame cut surface shall be ground smooth.
 d. Accuracy of Hole Group.
 1. Accuracy Before Reaming. All holes punched full size, subpunched, or subdrilled
 shall be so accurately punched that after assembling (before any reaming is done) a cylindrical
 pin 1/8-inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole may be entered
 perpendicular to the face of the member, without drifting, in at least 75 percent of the contiguous
 holes in the same plane. If the requirement is not fulfilled, the badly punched pieces will be
 rejected. If any hole will not pass a pin 3/16-inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the
 punched hole, this will be cause for rejection.
 2. Accuracy After Reaming. When holes are reamed or drilled, 85 percent of the holes
 in any contiguous group shall, after reaming or drilling, show no offset greater than 1/32-inch
 between adjacent thicknesses of metal.
 All steel templates shall have hardened steel bushings in holes accurately dimensioned
 from the centerlines of the connection as inscribed on the template. The centerlines shall be
 used in locating accurately the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 e. Holes for Ribbed Bolts, Turned Bolts, or Other Approved Bearing-Type Bolts.
 All holes for ribbed bolts, turned bolts, or other approved bearing-type bolts shall be subpunched
 or subdrilled 3/16-inch smaller than the nominal diameter of the bolt and reamed when
 assembled, or drilled to a steel template or, after assembling, drilled from the solid at the option
 of the fabricator. In any case the finished holes shall provide a driving fit as specified on the
 Plans or in the Special Provisions.
 
 8-135
 
 f. Preparation of Field Connections. Holes in all field connections and field splices of
 main members of trusses, arches, continuous bean spans, bents, towers (each face), plate
 girders, and rigid frames shall be subpunched or subdrilled and subsequently reamed while
 assembled or drilled full size to a steel template. Holes for field splices of rolled beam stringers
 continuous over floor beams or cross frames may be drilled full size unassembled to a steel
 template. All holes for floor beams or cross frames may be drilled full size unassembled to a
 steel template. All holes for floor beam and stringer field end connections shall be subpunched
 and reamed while assembled or drilled full size to a steel template. Reaming or drilling full size
 of field connection holes through a steel template shall be done after the template has been
 located with utmost care as to position and angle and firmly bolted in place. Templates used for
 reaming matching members, or the opposite faces of a single member, shall be exact duplicates.
 Templates used for connections on like parts or members shall be so accurately located that the
 parts or members are duplicates and require no match-marking.
 For any connection, in lieu of subpunching and reaming or subdrilling and reaming, the
 fabricator may, at his option, drill holes full size with all thicknesses or material assembled in
 proper position.
 824.03.4 Bolts and Bolted Connections Using Unfinished, Turned and Ribbed Bolts.
 a. General. Bolts shall be unfinished, turned or an approved form of ribbed bolts as
 designed. Bolts shall have hexagonal heads and nuts and shall be of such length that they will
 extend entirely thorough the nut but not more than 1/4-inch beyond.
 Beveled washers shall be used where bearing faces have a slope of more than 1:20 with
 respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Bolts shall have single self-locking nuts or double nuts.
 b. Unfinished Bolts. Bolts in shear shall have not more than one thread within the grip.
 The diameter of the unfinished bolt shall be not more than 1/16-inch smaller than the diameter
 of the hole.
 c. Turned Bolts. Holes for turned bolts shall be carefully reamed and the bolts turned
 to a light driving fit, with threads entirely outside of holes, and a washer shall be used. Onequarter inch nut locks shall be used on all turned bolts unless otherwise specified on the Plans.
 d. Ribbed Bolts. Special types of ribbed bolts, with drive fit, may be used if approved
 by the Engineer in writing, for special purposes or for field rivets in locations where, in the opinion
 of the Engineer, it is impractical to drive rivets. In the event that the bolt twists before drawing
 tight, it shall be removed, the hole rereamed and an oversize bolt used in replacement.
 824.03.5 Connections Using High Strength Bolts.
 a. General. This Subsection covers the assembly of structural joints using ASTM A325
 high strength carbon steel bolts or equivalent fasteners, tightened to a high tension. The bolts
 are used in holes conforming to the requirements of Subsection 824.03.3 of this Section.
 b. Bolts, Nuts and Washers. Bolts, nuts and washers shall conform to the requirements
 of Subsection M.05.04.4; Fasteners, of these Specifications.
 
 8-136
 
 c. Bolted Parts. The slope of surfaces of bolted parts in contact with the bolt head and
 nut shall not exceed 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Bolted parts shall fit
 solidly together when assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or any other interposed
 compressible material.
 When assembled, all joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the bolt heads, nuts or
 washers, shall be free of scale, except tight mill scale, and shall also be free of dirt, loose scale,
 burrs, other foreign material and other defects that would prevent solid seating of the parts.
 Contact surfaces within friction-type joints shall be free of oil, paint, lacquer, rust inhibitor
 or galvanizing.
 d. Installation. Each fastener shall be tightened to provide, when all fasteners in the joint
 are tight, at least the minimum bolt tension shown on the Bolt Tension Table in Para. g of this
 Subsection.
 Threaded bolts shall be tightened with properly calibrated wrenches or by the turn-of-the
 nut method. If required because of bolt entering and wrench operation clearances, tightening by
 either procedure may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating.
 Impact wrenches, if used, shall be of adequate capacity and sufficiently supplied with air
 (minimum 100 psi at tool for 7/8-inch bolts) to perform the required tightening of each bolt in
 approximately ten seconds.
 e. Washers. All fasteners shall have a hardened washer under the element (nut or bolt
 head) turned in tightening.
 Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to the bolt axis, a smooth beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack
 of parallelism.
 On diaphragm connections using oversized holes, a washer must be used over every
 oversized hole regardless of part turned in tightening.
 f. Calibrated Wrench Tightening. Calibrated wrench tightening may be used only when
 installation procedures are calibrated on a daily basis and when a hardened washer is used under
 the element turned in tightening. Standard torques determined from tables or from formulas
 which are assumed to relate torque to tension are not acceptable.
 When calibrated wrenches are used for installation they shall be set to provide a tension
 not less than 5 percent in excess of the minimum tension specified in the Bolt Tension Table in
 Para. g of this Subsection. The installation procedures shall be calibrated by verification testing
 at least once each working day for each bolt diameter, length and grade using fastener
 assemblies that are being installed in the work. This verification testing shall be accomplished
 in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension by tightening three typical bolts of each
 diameter, length and grade from the bolts being installed and with a hardened washer from the
 washers being used in the work under the element turned in tightening. Wrenches shall be
 recalibrated when significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts, threads, nuts
 or washers. It shall be verified during actual installation in the assembled steel work that the
 wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from
 8-137
 
 snug tight greater than that permitted in the Nut Rotation Table in Para. g of this Section. If
 manual torque wrenches are used, nuts shall be turned in the tightening direction when torque
 is measured.
 When calibrated wrenches are used to install and tension bolts in a connection, bolts shall
 be installed with hardened washers under the element turned in tightening bolts in all holes of the
 connection and brought to a snug tight condition. Following this initial tightening operation, the
 connection shall be tightened using the calibrated wrench. Tightening shall progress
 systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges. The wrench shall be returned
 to "touch up" previously tightened bolts which may have been relaxed as a result of the
 subsequent tightening of adjacent bolts until all bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount.
 g. Turn-of-Nut Tightening. Verification testing using a representative sample of not less
 than three bolt and nut assemblies of each diameter, length and grade to be used in the work
 shall be performed at the start of work in a device capable of indicating bolt tension. This
 verification test shall demonstrate that the method for estimating the snug tight condition and
 controlling the turns from snug tight to be used by the bolting crew develops a tension not less
 than 5 percent greater than the tension required by the Bolt Tension Table. Periodic retesting
 shall be performed when ordered by the Engineer.
 After snug tightening fasteners and fully compacting the connection, all bolts in the
 connection shall be tightened further by the applicable amount of rotation specified in the Nut
 Rotation Table. During the tightening operation there shall be no rotation of the part not turned
 by the wrench. Tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its
 free edges.

 Notes:
 a
 Nut rotation is relative to bolt, regardless of the element (nut or bolt) being turned. For bolts installed
 by ½ turn and less, the tolerance should be plus or minus 30 degrees; for bolts installed by 2/3 turn
 and more, the tolerance should be plus or minus 45 degrees.
 b
 
 Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel.
 
 c
 
 No research work has been performed by the Research Council Riveted and Bolted Structural
 Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure when bolt lengths exceed 12 diameters. Therefore, the
 required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the
 actual conditions.
 
 h. Inspection. The Engineer will determine that all requirements of this Specification are
 satisfied.
 The Engineer will approve the procedure for calibration of wrenches and installation of
 bolts and will further observe the field installation to determine that these procedures are followed.
 Spot checks will be made with a manual torque wrench that has been calibrated as
 previously specified.
 i. Load Indicator Devices. Load indicating devices may be used in conjunction with
 bolts, nuts and washers specified in Subsection M.05.04.4. Load indicating devices shall
 conform to the requirements of ASTM Specification for Compressible-Washer Type Direct
 8-139
 
 Tension Indicators for Use with Structural Fasteners, ASTM F959, except as provided in the
 following paragraph.
 Subject to the approval of the Engineer, alternate design direct tension indicating devices
 may be used provided they satisfy the requirements detailed in specifications provided by the
 manufacturer.
 824.03.6 Welding.
 a. General. Unless specified otherwise herein, all welding, welder qualifications,
 prequalification of weld details and inspection of welds shall conform to the requirements of the
 current ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 Brackets, clips, shipping devices or other material not required by the Plans or Special
 Provisions shall not be welded or tacked to any member unless shown on the shop drawings and
 approved by the Engineer.
 b. Qualification of Welders. All work shall be in accordance with the best modern
 practice using qualified welding operators. The same type of equipment as required for the
 execution of the actual construction work shall be used in qualifying welders and welding
 operators.
 If the Contractor prequalifies his metal-arc welding operators according to the standard
 qualification procedure of the American Welding Society and certifies to the Engineer that an
 operator working on the structure has been prequalified previously, the Engineer may consider
 such operator qualified. This certificate shall state that such operator has been doing satisfactory
 welding of the required type within the 3-month period previous to the subject work. A
 certification shall be submitted for each operator and for each project, stating the name of the
 operator, the name and title of the person who conducted the examination, the kind of specimens,
 the positions of welds, the results of the test, the date of the examination and the identifying steel
 stamp symbol assigned. Such a certification of prequalification may also be accepted as proof
 that an operator of field welding is qualified, if the Contractor who submits it is properly staffed
 and equipped to conduct such an examination, or if the examining and testing is done by a
 recognized agency which is staffed and equipped for such purpose. The qualification of a welder
 shall not prohibit his subsequent removal from the job for poor workmanship in execution of
 welds.
 The welder shall place his identification stamp near the welds that he has made.
 Shop welding shall be done in areas sheltered from wind and weather with an ambient
 minimum temperature of 50OF, unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer.
 c. Qualification of Welding Procedure. The Contractor shall submit a complete welding
 procedure specification for welding all primary members and other members on which welds are
 subject to calculated stress prior to proceeding with fabrication.
 d. Procedures for Manual Shielded Metal-Arc Welding. The work shall be positioned
 for flat position welding whenever practicable.

 824.03.7 Inspection of Welds.
 a. General. All welding, both shop and field, shall be subject to inspection by the
 Engineer, in accordance with ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code, as amended
 herein. The principal method of inspection shall be non-destructive testing, which may be carried
 out by radiographic, magnetic particle, dye penetrant or ultrasonic methods, or any other methods
 designated by the Engineer. A minimum routine inspection program is outlined in TABLE 1.
 However, inspection shall in no way be construed to be limited to the program described.
 A routine inspection program shall be established to which all welding shall be subject.
 This program shall involve two types of inspection.
 b. Visual Inspection of Welds and Welding Operations. The Engineer shall have
 unlimited access to the site of welding operations, and shall be free to observe the procedure and
 techniques used by the Contractor on all welds. The program of visual inspection will be adapted
 to job conditions. The cost of visual inspection shall be borne by the State.
 c. Non-destructive Testing. A routine program of non-destructive testing will be carried
 out on all welds (shop and field) carrying calculated stress as indicated in Table 1 of this
 Subsection.
 All non-destructive testing will be performed by the State, except that the Contractor shall,
 at his own expense, radiograph and furnish the State one set of films of shop butt welds above
 specified and shall furnish all equipment and an operator at his own expense for the making of
 magnetic particle tests of shop fillet welds as above specified. All other costs of non-destructive
 inspection shall be borne by the State except that the Contractor shall furnish all labor and
 equipment required to move and position the various members for inspection. No additional
 compensation shall be granted to the Contractor for moving, handling, rehandling or positioning
 the members to facilitate testing.

 824.03.8 Machining.
 a. Edge Planing. Sheared edges of plates more than 5/8-inch in thickness and carrying
 calculated stress shall be planed to a depth of 1/4-inch. Re-entrant cuts shall be filleted before
 cutting.
 b. Oxygen Cutting. Steel and weld metal may be oxygen cut, provided a smooth and
 regular surface free from cracks and notches is secured, and provided that an accurate profile
 is secured by the use of a mechanical guide. Hand cutting shall be done only where approved
 by the Engineer.
 Mill scale and extraneous material shall be removed from the torch side of A514/A517
 steel plates along the lines to be flame cut, when necessary to obviate excessive notches.
 All oxygen cutting shall be in accordance with AWS D.1.5, except that occasional notches
 or gouges in edges of A514/A517 steel shall not be repaired by welding except under the
 following conditions:
 1. Cutting defects not more than 3/16-inch deep in plate edges which will form the faces
 of a groove weld joint and which will subsequently be completely fused with the weld may be
 repaired by welding. Nonmetallic stringers or pipes opening to these edges shall be removed to
 a depth of 1/4-inch below the surface by grinding or chipping and the gouge repaired by welding.
 Laminations opening to these edges shall be removed to a depth of ½-inch below the surface by
 grinding and chipping and the gouge repaired by welding.
 2. Cutting defects not more than 3/16-inch deep in plate edges which will form a filletwelded corner joint shall be repaired by welding only on the part of the edge which will become
 the facing surface for the joint and the fusion zone of the fillet weld. The part of the defect outside
 the toe of the completed fillet weld shall be removed by machining or grinding, and faired with the
 surface of the cut on a bevel of 1 to 6 or less.
 3. All welding for these repairs shall be made by suitably preparing the defect, welding
 with low hydrogen electrodes not exceeding 5/32-inch in diameter, and grinding the completed
 weld smooth and flush with the adjacent surface to produce a workmanlike finish.
 Oxygen cut edges of ASTM A440 steel and ½-inch or greater in thickness(1) shall be
 removed to a depth of at least 1/8-inch by machining or grinding except that machine flame cut
 edges may be used without such removal if the edges are softened after cutting; (a) by heating
 the cut edge uniformly and progressively to a red heat, visible in ordinary shop light (1,150 to
 1,250OF) to a depth of at least 1/16-inch; or (b) by means of a post heating torch attached to and
 following the cutting torch with the tips, gas pressure, speed or travel, and the distance of the post
 heating torch from the kerf regulated to the thickness of the steel. Bend test specimens 1½inches wide and of the full thickness of the material or with thickness reduced to 3/4-inch in
 accordance with Para. 6.8 of ASTM A6 and having edges flame cut and flame softened in
 accordance with this article shall meet the bend test requirements specified in ASTM A440 for
 the thickness of material under consideration.
 Oxygen cut surfaces of members carrying calculated stress shall have their corners
 rounded to 1/16-inch radius by grinding after cutting.
 
 8-143
 
 Note (1): ASTM A242 steel not approved for welded construction requires this treatment of
 oxygen cut edges in all thicknesses and with bend tests, as applicable, conforming to ASTM
 A242 for the thickness of material under consideration.
 
 c. Facing of Bearing Surfaces. The top and bottom surfaces of steel slabs and base
 plates and cap plates of columns and pedestals shall be straight and true to provide full bearing
 between contact areas.
 Sole plates of beams and girders shall have full contact with the flanges. Cast pedestals
 shall be machined on surfaces to be in contact with steel and shall be rough finished on surfaces
 to be in contact with masonry.

 d. Abutting Joints. Abutting joints in compression members and girder flanges, and in
 tension members where so specified on the drawings, shall be faced and brought to an even
 bearing. Where joints are not faced, the opening shall not exceed 3/8-inch.
 e. End Connection Angles. Floor beams, stringers and girders having end connection
 angles shall be built to exact length back to back of connection angles. If end connections are
 faced, the finished thickness of the angles shall not be less than that shown on the detail
 drawings.
 f. Pins and Rollers. Pins and rollers shall be accurately turned to the dimensions shown
 on the drawings and shall be straight, smooth and free from flaws. The final surface shall be
 produced by a fine finishing cut as specified. Pin holes shall be bored true to the specified
 diameter, smooth and straight, at right angles with the axis of the completed member. The
 distance outside to outside of holes in tension members and inside to inside of holes in
 compression members shall not vary from that specified more than 1/32-inch. Boring of holes
 in built-up members shall be done after the riveting and welding is completed. The diameter of
 the pin hole shall not exceed that of the pin by more than 1/50-inch for pins 5 inches or less in
 diameter, or 1/32-inch for pins of larger size.
 Threads for all bolts and pins for structural steel construction shall conform to the
 American National Coarse Thread Series, Class 2, free fit, except that the pin ends having a
 diameter of 1d-inches or more shall be threaded six threads to the inch.
 8-144
 
 Finished members shall be true to line and free from twists, bends and open joints.
 Shearing and chipping shall be done carefully and accurately.
 g. Fit of Stiffeners. End stiffeners, stiffeners over intermediate supports of girders, and
 stiffener angles intended as supports for concentrated loads shall be milled or ground to secure
 an even bearing against the flange. Intermediate stiffeners shall fit sufficiently tight to exclude
 water after being painted. Fillers under stiffeners shall fit within 1/4-inch at each end.
 h. Annealing and Stress Relieving. Structural members which are indicated in the
 Contract to be annealed or normalized shall have finished machining, boring, and straightening
 done subsequent to heat treatment. Normalizing and annealing (full annealing) shall be as
 specified in ASTM E44. The temperatures shall be maintained uniformly throughout the furnace
 during the heating and cooling so that the temperature at no two points on the member will differ
 by more than 100OF at any one time.
 Members of AASHTO M270 (ASTM A709) Grades 100/100W or Grade 70W steels shall
 not be annealed or normalized and shall be stress relieved only with the approval of the Engineer.
 A record of each furnace charge shall identify the pieces in the charge and show the
 temperatures and schedule actually used. Proper instruments, including recording pyrometers,
 shall be provided for determining at any time the temperatures of members in the furnace. The
 records of the treatment operation shall be available to and meet the approval of the Engineer.
 The holding temperature for stress relieving Grades 100/100W and Grade 70W steels shall not
 exceed 1100OF and 1050OF, respectively.
 Members, such as bridge shoes, pedestals, or other parts which are built up by the
 welding sections of plate together shall be stress-relieved in accordance with the procedure of
 the American Welding Society Section 4.4 of the current ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge
 Welding Code when required by the Plans or Specifications.
 824.03.9 Marking, Shipping, Delivering and Handling. Each member shall be painted or
 marked with an erection mark for identification and an erection diagram showing these marks
 shall be furnished to the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall furnish to the Engineer as many copies of material orders, shipping
 statements, and erection diagrams as the Engineer may direct. The weights of the individual
 members shall be shown on the statements. Members weighing more than 3 tons shall have the
 weights marked thereon. Structural members shall be loaded on trucks or cars in such a manner
 that they may be transported and unloaded at their destination without being excessively
 stressed, deformed, or otherwise damaged.
 Bolts, nuts and washers (where required) from each rotational-capacity lot shall be
 shipped in the same container. If there is only one production lot number for each size of nut and
 washer, the nuts and washers may be shipped in separate containers. Pins, small parts and
 packages of bolts, washers, and nuts shall be shipped in boxes, crates, kegs, or barrels, but the
 gross weight of any package shall not exceed 300 pounds. A list and description of the contained
 materials shall be plainly marked on the outside of each shipping container.
 
 8-145
 
 The loading and delivery of the structural material shall be conducted so that the metal
 will be kept clean and free from injury. Girders and beams shall be kept upright and shored.
 Long members shall be supported on skids spaced to prevent injury from deflection.
 824.03.10 Erection.
 a. General. The Contractor shall provide the falsework and all tools, machinery and
 appliances, including drift pins and fitting bolts necessary for the expeditious handling of the work.
 Before starting work, the Contractor shall inform the Engineer fully as to the method of erection
 he proposes to follow, and the amount and character of equipment he proposes to use, all of
 which shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The approval of the Engineer shall not
 be considered as relieving the Contractor of the responsibility for the safety of his method or
 equipment or from carrying out the work in full accordance with the Plans and these Specifications.
 b. Transportation of Materials. The Contractor shall make the necessary arrangements
 for the unloading and the transporting and bear all charges for such unloading and hauling of the
 steel from the designated place of delivery to the point of placement. The Contractor shall unload
 promptly upon delivery any material delivered on railroad cars which he is required to unload, and
 shall be responsible for demurrage charges.
 c. Storage of Materials at Site. Material to be stored shall be placed on skids above the
 ground. It shall be kept clean and properly drained. Girders and beams shall be placed upright
 and shored. Long members, such as columns and chords, shall be supported on skids placed
 near enough together to prevent injury from deflection. If the contract is for erection only, the
 Contractor shall check the material turned over to him against the shipping lists and report
 promptly in writing any shortage or injury discovered. The Contractor shall be responsible for the
 loss of any material while in his care, or for any damage caused to it after being received by him.
 d. Falsework. The falsework shall be properly designed and substantially constructed
 and maintained for the loads which will come upon it. The Contractor shall prepare and submit
 to the Engineer for approval, plans for falsework or for changes in an existing structure necessary
 for maintaining traffic. Approval of the Contractor's plans shall not be considered as relieving the
 Contractor of his primary responsibility for the adequacy of the design.
 e. Straightening Bent Material (Field). The straightening of plates, angles, other
 shapes, and built-up members, when permitted by the Engineer, shall be done by methods that
 will not produce fracture or other injury to the metal. Distorted members shall be straightened by
 mechanical means or, if approved by the Engineer, by carefully planned procedures and
 supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat, except that heat straightening of
 AASHTO M270 (ASTM A709) Grades 70W, 100 and 100W steel members shall be done only
 under rigidly controlled procedures, with each application subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 In no case shall the maximum temperature exceed values in the following table.
 Grade
 Grade 70W > 6" from weld
 Grade 70W < 6" from weld
 Grade 100 or 100W > 6" from weld
 Grade 100 or 100W < 6" from weld
 8-146
 
 Max. Temp.
 1050OF
 900OF
 1100OF
 950OF
 
 In all other steels, the temperature of the heated area shall not exceed 1,200OF as
 controlled by temperature indicating crayons, liquids, or bimetal thermometers. Heating in excess
 of the limits shown shall be cause for rejection, unless the Engineer allows testing to verify
 material integrity.
 Parts to be heat straightened shall be substantially free of stress and from external forces,
 except stresses resulting from mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat.
 Evidence of fracture following straightening of a bend or buckle will be cause for rejection
 of the damaged piece.
 f. Assembling Steel. The parts shall be accurately assembled as shown on the Plans
 and any match-marks shall be followed. The materials shall be carefully handled so that no parts
 will be bent, broken or otherwise damaged. Hammering which will injure or distort the members
 shall not be done. Bearing surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent contact shall be cleaned
 before the members are assembled. Splices and field connections shall have one-half of the
 holes filled with bolts and cylindrical pins (half bolts and half pins) before riveting.
 Fitting-up bolts shall be of the same nominal diameter as the rivets, and cylindrical
 erection pins shall be 1/32-inch larger.
 g. Bolted Connections. Surfaces of metal in contact shall be cleaned before
 assembling. The parts of a member shall be assembled, well pinned, and firmly drawn together
 before drilling, reaming, or bolting is commenced. Assembled pieces shall be taken apart, if
 necessary, for the removal of burrs and shavings produced by the operation. The member shall
 be free from twists, bends, and other deformation.
 The drifting done during assembling shall be only such as to bring the parts into position
 and not sufficient to enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
 For high-strength bolted connections, see Subsection 824.03.5 of this Section.
 h. Field Welding. When field welding is specified, it shall be performed by the electric
 arc process and shall conform to the same requirements as noted under Subsection 824.03.6
 with the following modifications:
 Unless approved by the Engineer, welding shall not be undertaken when the ambient
 temperature is lower than 32OF, when surfaces are wet or exposed to rain, snow or high wind nor
 when the welders would be exposed to inclement conditions.
 i. Misfits. The correction of minor misfits involving non-harmful amounts of reaming,
 cutting and chipping will be considered a legitimate part of the erection. However, any error in
 the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and transportation which prevents the
 proper assembling and fitting up of parts by the moderate use of drift pins or by a moderate
 amount of reaming and slight chipping or cutting, shall be reported immediately to the Inspector
 and his approval of the method of correction obtained. The correction shall be made in his
 presence. The Contractor shall be responsible for all misfits, errors and injuries and shall make
 all the necessary corrections and replacements.
 
 8-147
 
 j. Removal of Falsework. Upon completion of the erection and before final acceptance,
 the Contractor shall remove all falsework, excavated or useless materials, rubbish and temporary
 buildings and restore in an acceptable manner all property, both public and private which may
 have been damaged during the prosecution of this work, and shall leave the bridge site and
 adjacent highway in a neat and presentable condition satisfactory to the Engineer.
 824.03.11 Surface Preparation for Weathering Steel.
 a. Cleaning After Fabrication. After completion of fabrication operations all steel
 surfaces shall be blast cleaned in accordance with the requirements of Steel Structures Painting
 Council Surface Preparation Specification No. 6 - "Commercial Blast Cleaning," SSPC-SP 6.
 Particular attention shall be given to all exposed surfaces including the outside face and bottom
 side of fascia girders and all exposed fascia welds.
 b. Handling. All cleaned steel is to be handled carefully to keep it clean. The steel is to
 be treated with the care and concern that is required for any finished architectural product.
 Exposed steel shall be kept free and clean of all foreign material such as grease, oil, concrete
 spatter, chalk marks, crayon marks, dirt, etc. Natural oxidation of the steel shall not be
 considered foreign matter.
 c. Final Cleaning. After the deck is in place and all formwork has been removed the
 steel surfaces shall be inspected for stains, discoloration, and any other deleterious materials
 which may affect the weathering of the steel in a uniform manner. All steel surfaces, in particular
 exposed steel surfaces as described above, shall be returned to the SP 6, "Commercial Blast
 Cleaned" finish. The Contractor shall use whatever Steel Structures Painting Council Surface
 Cleaning Methods are necessary and appropriate to accomplish that goal. Once the final
 cleaning is accomplished no further use of the structural steel for attachment or support will be
 allowed.
 824.03.12 Shear Connectors.
 a. Welding. Stud shear connectors shall be end-welded to steel beams or girders (on
 axes parallel to the transverse reinforcement) with automatically timed stud welding equipment
 connected to a suitable power source.
 If two or more stud welding guns are to be operated from the same power source, they
 shall be interlocked so that only one gun can operate at a time and so that the power source has
 fully recovered from making one weld before another weld is started.
 At the time of welding, the studs and beams shall be free from moisture, rust, rust pits,
 scale, oil or other deleterious matter which would adversely affect the welding operation.
 Welding shall not be done when the ambient temperature is below 32OF, or when the
 surface is wet or exposed to rain or snow.
 While in operation, the welding gun shall be held in position without movement until the
 weld metal has solidified.
 Longitudinal and lateral spacings of studs with respect to each other and to edges of beam
 or girder flanges shall not vary more than one-half inch from the dimensions shown on the Plans,
 except that a diagonal variation of 1 inch will be permitted where required to avoid obstruction
 8-148
 
 with other attachments on the beam or where a new stud is being welded to replace a defective
 one. The minimum distance from the edge of a stud to the edge of a beam shall be 1 inch, but
 preferably not less than 1½-inches.
 The first two studs welded on each beam or girder, after being allowed to cool, shall be
 bent 45O by striking the stud with a hammer. If failure occurs in the weld of either stud, the
 procedure shall be corrected and two successive studs successfully welded and tested before
 any more studs are welded to the beam or girder. The Engineer shall be promptly informed of
 any changes in the welding procedure at any time during construction.
 If the reduction in the height of studs as they are welded becomes less than normal,
 welding shall be stopped immediately and not resumed until the cause has been corrected.
 Before welding a new stud where a defective one has been removed, the area shall be
 ground smooth and flush, or in the case of a pullout of metal, the pocket shall be filled with weld
 metal using the shielded metal-arc process with low-hydrogen welding electrodes and then
 ground flush. In compression areas of flanges, a new stud may be welded adjacent to the
 defective area in lieu of repair and replacement on the existing weld area.
 b. Inspection. If visual inspection reveals any stud which does not show a full 360degree weld, any stud which has been repaired by welding, or any stud in which the reduction in
 height due to welding is less than normal, such stud shall be struck with a hammer and bent 15
 degrees off the vertical. For studs showing less than 360-degree weld, the direction of bending
 shall be opposite to the lack of weld. Studs that crack either in the weld or the shank shall be
 replaced.
 The Engineer may select additional studs to be subjected to the bend test specified above.
 The studs tested that show no sign of failure may be left in the bent position.
 If, during the progress of the work, inspection and testing indicate in the judgment of the
 Engineer, that the shear connectors being obtained are not satisfactory, the Contractor will be
 required at his expense to make such changes in welding procedure, welding equipment and type
 of shear connector as necessary to secure satisfactory results.
 At the option of the Engineer, the manufacturer of the studs may be required at any time
 to submit requalification test data in accordance with the procedure as set forth in AASHTO
 Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges.
 824.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.
 824.04.1 General. "Structural Steel" of the various types and configurations described in this
 Section will be measured by the number of pounds of each such type and configuration actually
 provided in accordance with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 For the purpose of measurement, such items as castings, forgings, wrought iron, special
 alloy steels, weld metal and special shapes for expansion joints, shear connectors, drainage
 fixtures, or railing shall, unless otherwise covered by Special Provisions, be considered as
 structural steel even when made of other materials.

 825.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 825.03.1 New Steel Structures. Work under this paragraph shall include only those structures
 being built new or structures whose superstructure is being replaced in its entirety. New steel
 utilized in partial replacement or rehabilitation shall be addressed in the Special Provisions found
 in the Contract Documents.
 a. Cleaning. Where oil and/or grease are present they shall be removed by solvent
 cleaning methods as described in the Steel Structures Painting Council Surface Preparation
 Specification No. 1; Solvent Cleaning (SSPC-SP1). This cleaning shall be performed prior to
 blast cleaning. If contamination remains after blast cleaning, the surfaces shall be recleaned with
 the SSPC-SP1 procedures.
 b. Surface Preparation. Surface preparation shall be in accordance with the Steel
 Structures Painting Council Specifications and any additional requirements contained in the
 Special Provisions found in the Contract Documents.
 All steel shall be blast cleaned to a near white condition using the cleaning methods
 described in the Steel Structures Painting Council Surface Preparation Specification No. 10; Near
 White Blast Cleaning (SSPC-SP10). The surface area of the steel to be blast cleaned shall be
 no greater than the surface area of steel that can be prime coated in the same day. The
 maximum time lapse between surface preparation and application of the prime coat shall not be
 greater than 8 hours. Should any "rust back" occur prior to the application of the prime coat, the
 surfaces shall be recleaned to the near white condition. The blast cleaning shall leave a 1.5 to
 2.5 mil deep anchor profile in a dense uniform pattern of depressions and ridges.
 Flame cut edges shall be ground before or after blast cleaning to assist in attaining the
 required anchor profile. All fins, tears, slivers and burred or sharp edges present before or after
 blast cleaning shall be removed by grinding or reblasting to attain the required anchor profile. All
 reamed or drilled holes in the steel shall have their edges cleaned and softened by grinding prior
 to blast cleaning.
 The near white blast condition may be determined and/or verified by the use of a NACE
 No. 2 visual standard T.M.-01-75 when shot blast is used or SSPC pictorial standard guide Vis-1
 if sand or grit is used. The surface profile depth shall be measured and/or verified by the use of
 an Elcometer surface profile gauge, or equal, or Testex Replica Tape.
 Compressed air supply lines shall be equipped with oil traps and moisture separators.
 The traps and separators shall be cleaned and/or changed on a regular basis.
 
 8-154
 
 All abrasive and deleterious material residues shall be removed from steel surfaces with
 a commercial grade vacuum cleaner equipped with a brush type cleaning tool or by double
 blowing with clean compressed air. Air cleaning shall be followed up by vacuum cleaning of the
 top surfaces of all flanges, stiffeners, splice plates, hangers, etc. The steel shall then be kept
 dust free until the coating is applied.
 Care shall be taken to protect freshly coated surfaces from subsequent blast cleaning
 operations. Previously primed surfaces damaged by subsequent blasting operations shall be
 returned to the near white condition by reblasting or wire brush cleaning. The surfaces shall then
 be vacuumed and reprimed.
 The Contractor/fabricator shall provide access to any location where cleaning and painting
 may be in progress for servicemen, manufacturer's representatives, Department representatives
 or other duly authorized persons.
 The Engineer's approval of the preparation of all surfaces to be painted is required before
 any paint is applied.
 c. Painting.
 1. Mixing. The coatings shall be mixed in their original containers. All paints shall be
 mixed with a high shear mixer to a smooth lump free consistency. Paddle mixers or paint
 shakers shall not be used. The mixing shall continue until all of the metallic powders or pigments
 are in suspension taking care that all solids that may have settled to the bottom of the container
 are thoroughly dispersed. All paints shall be strained through a 30-60 mesh screen to remove
 large particles. Paint containers for spray applications shall be equipped with a mechanical
 agitator so the mixture is in motion throughout the application period.
 In general, coatings are supplied for use without thinning. Thinning will only be allowed
 for application of mist coats or for special circumstances. Any thinning that is deemed necessary
 shall be done in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and only with prior
 approval of the Engineer.
 2. Conditions for Painting. Paint shall be applied on clean and dry surfaces only. Paint
 for the prime, intermediate and top coats shall not be applied when the temperature of the air,
 paint, or steel is below 40OF, or when the temperature is expected to fall below 40OF before the
 paint is cured. The paint for all coatings shall not be applied when the wind velocity is in excess
 of 20 mph, when the air is misty, or when, in the opinion of the Engineer, conditions are
 unsatisfactory for the work. Paint shall not be applied onto damp or frost covered surfaces or
 when the metal is hot enough to cause the paint to blister, become porous, or cause the vehicle
 to separate from the pigment. Paint shall not be applied when the steel surface temperature is
 lower than 5OF above the dew point. The dew point shall be determined by the use of a
 psychrometer (wet bulb thermometer) and appropriate tables. The coating shall not be applied
 when the relative humidity is greater than 85 percent nor when a combination of temperature and
 humidity conditions are such that moisture condenses on the surfaces to be coated. Daily logs
 of air and surface temperatures, dew point, and relative humidity in the shop, paint booth, external
 painting area, or field shall be maintained.
 Before application of the primer touch up, intermediate or finish coat in the field, all zinc
 salts, oil, dust, dirt and other contaminants shall be removed from the steel or previously painted
 8-155
 
 surfaces to be painted. Primed surfaces shall be cleaned by a high pressure water washing (800
 psi min.).
 3. Paint Application. The coating system shall be capable of application by brush, roller,
 or spray (airless or conventional) methods. The method of application of each particular coat
 shall be the method most highly recommended by the coating manufacturer. The prime coat shall
 be applied immediately after inspection and acceptance of the surface. The primer shall be
 applied the same day the metal is cleaned (within 8 hours). If the surfaces remain unpainted
 overnight they shall be reblasted again prior to priming. Succeeding coats shall not be applied
 until each coat is approved by the Engineer. The minimum time between coats shall be in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Depending on site conditions, additional
 time may be needed between coats to assure proper curing. It is the applicator's responsibility
 to determine if the coating has cured sufficiently for proper application of succeeding coats.
 Should the maximum time interval between coats be exceeded, surface preparation requirements
 shall be in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
 Prior to application of the full prime coat, a prime coating (striping) shall be applied to all
 edges of plates, shapes, corners, crevices, welds, rivet heads and exposed parts of bolts. The
 full prime coat shall not be applied until the striping has set to the touch.
 The coating of paint shall be smoothly and uniformly spread so that every part of the
 surface will be covered with at least the minimum specified thickness and so that no excess paint
 will collect at any point. A dense and uniform appearance is required after each coating has
 cured.
 If the paint coating is too thin or if portions of the surface are not completely coated, such
 portions of the work shall be repainted. If the application of the coating at the required thickness
 in one coat produces runs, bubbles, or sags, the coating shall be applied in multiple passes of
 the spray gun. Where excessive coating thickness produces surface defects such as "mud
 cracking," such coating shall be removed back to soundly bonded coating and the area recoated
 to the required thickness. In areas of deficient primer thickness, the areas shall be thoroughly
 cleaned with power washing equipment, as necessary to remove all dirt. The areas shall then be
 wire brushed, vacuumed and recoated.
 All dry spray shall be removed, by sanding if necessary, prior to the application of the
 succeeding coat.
 Surfaces of steel which will be in contact or embedded in concrete and/or contact surfaces
 at field bolted connections shall be given a prime coat of paint only. These surfaces shall be
 masked during subsequent coating operations when applicable. Surfaces within two inches of
 field welds (except for stud shear connectors) shall not be painted, but receive a light coat of rust
 prohibitive coating and be masked during coating operations.
 All bolted shop connections shall be removed prior to the blasting and coating of girders
 and beams. The parts shall be blasted and coated separately and then reassembled.
 All bolts, nuts and washers used in final field splices and connections shall be field
 blasted, once the splice is complete, to SSPC-SP6 condition and primed in the same manner as
 all other structural steel components.
 
 8-156
 
 The coatings shall be applied using brushes, rollers, spray equipment or any combination
 of equipment that will attain satisfactory results and the film thickness specified.
 4. Spray Painting. Spray nozzles and pressures shall be in accordance with
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 When painting operations are interrupted, paint remaining in the hose shall be expelled
 from the hose. Spray equipment which is used for application of paints shall be thoroughly
 cleaned at the end of each workday.
 Compressed air lines shall be provided with oil traps and moisture separators. The traps
 and separators shall be changed on a regular basis. Compressed air shall be in accordance with
 the blotter test as described in ASTM D4285.
 5. Brush Painting. Brushes shall preferably be round or oval in shape, but if flat brushes
 are used they shall not exceed 4.5 inches in width. All brushes shall have sufficient body and
 length of bristle to spread the paint in a uniform coat. The paint shall be manipulated under the
 brush to produce a uniform, even coat in contact with the metal or with previously applied paint,
 and shall be worked into all corners and crevices. In general, the primary movement of the brush
 shall describe small circles to fill the irregularities in the surfaces, after which the coating shall be
 brushed out and smoothed by a series of parallel strokes until the paint film has an even
 thickness.
 6. Roller Painting. Rollers, when used, shall be of the type that do not leave a stippled
 texture in the paint film. Rollers may be used only on flat, even surfaces. The rollers shall be
 manipulated in a manner to produce a paint film of even thickness with no skips, runs, sags, or
 thin areas. The roller operation should be followed closely by a bristle brush to level off any air
 bubbles.
 7. Film Thickness. The coatings shall be applied so as to attain the film thicknesses
 specified by the manufacturer. Surfaces to be coated with primer include the faying (contact)
 surfaces of bolted field splices. The dry film thickness of the primer coat on the faying surfaces

 8-185
 
 837.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS. The Contractor shall inspect the structure to acquaint
 himself with the nature and extent of the work.
 Repair of concrete shall be performed with qualified workmen. The Engineer, at his
 option, shall witness all repair work. The Engineer shall be notified of any repair work no later
 than 24 hours prior to the scheduled repair work.
 837.03.1 Surface Preparation.
 a. General Requirements. All deteriorated, disintegrated, soft, honeycombed, fractured,
 or otherwise defective concrete shall be removed from the areas to be repaired by means of
 suitable power and hand tools to a uniform depth, sufficient to expose a bonding surface of sound
 material as determined by the Engineer. Power tools that cause over-breakage of concrete will
 not be allowed. At the direction of the Engineer, the perimeter of the area to be repaired will be
 saw cut parallel to the horizontal and/or vertical axis of the element being repaired to a depth of
 at least 3/4-inch. Thin or feathered edges will not be permitted. Areas to be repaired shall be
 roughly circular or rectangular in outline. Re-entrant corners and shapes which include acute
 angles shall be avoided.
 In areas where reinforcing steel is found to be surrounded by deteriorated concrete or
 where at least one-half of the rebar surface area is exposed, the depth of concrete removal shall
 be such as to include all deteriorated concrete and not less than 1 inch minimum annular
 clearance around the reinforcing bars. Concrete removal shall extend along the reinforcement
 to where it is well bonded to sound concrete. All corroded reinforcing bars shall be thoroughly
 cleaned to remove all rust. Those bars that have lost 20 percent or more of their original crosssectional area shall be supplemented by new equal diameter bars spliced in place. New bars
 shall be lapped sufficiently (30 diameters on both sides of the affected area) to develop the full
 design strength of the bar. If necessary, additional chipping will be required to provide this lap.
 Dual bars of equivalent or greater section may be used.
 Repairs less than 1½-inches thick will not require wire mesh reinforcement unless
 specified by the Engineer. In cases where the thickness is greater, the Engineer shall, in general,
 order that wire mesh reinforcement be used every 1½-inches in depth and provide a minimum
 of 3/4-inch cover. In such cases, after the surface preparation has been approved, concrete
 anchors to hold the wire mesh reinforcement shall be placed according to Table 1, unless
 otherwise directed by the Engineer.

 All chipped areas, corroded rebars and concrete surfaces to be repaired shall be
 thoroughly cleaned by means of compressed air, sandblasting, waterblasting, steam, wire
 brushing or by other methods approved by the Engineer. The Contractor may use one or all of
 the various means of cleaning chipped areas as approved or as directed by the Engineer.
 Once all deteriorated concrete has been removed, the existing sound concrete shall be
 maintained in a clean, rough, and surface saturated moist condition until the concrete repair has
 been completed. When an epoxy-resin agent is specified, the prepared sound concrete surface
 shall be thoroughly dried prior to application of the epoxy-resin.
 Care shall be taken during the removal of the designated portions of the structure to avoid
 damaging the portions that are to remain in place. Any damage caused by the Contractor to the
 existing structure that is designated to remain in place shall be repaired or replaced by the
 Contractor at his own expense to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Mechanical concrete anchors shall be expansion bolts of a type approved by the Engineer.
 The exposed end of each anchor shall have a means of engaging reinforcement, either
 mechanical or hooked, and supplemented by the use of coated steel tie wire.
 If any reinforcement is damaged by the Contractor in his operations, the bar shall be
 replaced as required by the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense.
 b. Forms. Forms shall be used for Portland cement concrete repairs whenever necessary
 to confine the concrete and shape it to the required lines. Such forms may partially require
 progressive installation as the concrete is placed as a result of confinements for placing concrete
 due to the location of the particular repair or restoration required. The forms shall have sufficient
 strength to withstand the pressure resulting from placing operations, shall be maintained rigidly
 in position, and shall be sufficiently tight to prevent loss of mortar from the concrete. The use of
 form oils is expressly forbidden. The Contractor shall use an alternate method or material for
 facilitating form release that will not cause discoloration or staining of the concrete. All such
 methods or materials are subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 c. Weather Limitations. With respect to temperature and weather conditions, concrete
 repair materials shall be used in accordance with the applicable requirements of Subsection
 Nos. 601.03.4, 601.03.5, and 601.03.6; Limitations of Mixing, Cold Weather Concrete, and
 Hot Weather Concrete, respectively.
 837.03.2 Application.
 a. Prime Coat. Prior to placing the concrete or mortar on a previously prepared and
 approved concrete surface, the entire area to be patched shall first be given a prime coat using
 a Portland cement bonding grout slurry.
 The consistency of the Portland cement bonding grout slurry shall be such that it can be
 applied with a brush on a prepared moist concrete surface in a thin (approximately 1/8-inch) even
 coating that will not run or puddle. Excess bonding grout will not be permitted to collect in
 pockets. The Portland cement bonding grout shall be applied to the concrete and the surfaces
 of the reinforcing bars, and into the spaces between the reinforcing bars and the prepared
 concrete surfaces. Care shall be exercised to ensure that all surfaces receive a thorough, even
 coating.
 8-187
 
 The rate of bonding grout application shall be limited to that surface area which can be
 covered with new concrete or mortar before the bonding grout begins to dry out. Any grout that
 has dried or become unworkable, as determined by the Engineer, shall not be incorporated in the
 work. In the event drying does occur, the Contractor shall remove the bonding grout and place
 new bonding grout. The removal of the bonding grout shall be by a method approved by the
 Engineer and at the Contractor’s expense.
 b. Placing and Consolidation. Integrally colored Portland cement concrete shall be
 placed, consolidated, and finished on a previously prepared surface as described in this
 Specification and to which a Portland cement bonding grout slurry has been applied.
 Integrally colored patching mortar shall be placed in ½-inch to 1-inch lift layers within 5 to
 10 minutes after mixing water is added to avoid the rapid setup of the material after the
 application of the bonding grout slurry.
 If more than one lift layer is required to perform the repair, the previously placed lift layer
 will not be allowed to dry, and its surface shall be roughened prior to placing the next layer.
 Patching mortar shall not be applied when the ambient temperature is below 45OF or is
 not in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 c. Finish. All exposed surfaces shall be finished straight and true, approximating the
 original contour as close as practicable. The final finished surfaces shall match the texture, color
 and aggregate exposure of the existing concrete surfaces adjoining or proximate to the area
 where new concrete has been placed.
 The Contractor shall capture all the waste and water from the finishing operations, and
 dispose these materials. All materials and/or labor costs resulting from the surface finishing
 operations, including sedimentation and dewatering controls shall be included in this item of work.
 d. Curing. Curing procedures and methods shall comply with the color additive
 manufacturer’s recommendations and as set forth in Subsection 601.03.8; Curing, of these
 Specifications, or as otherwise directed by the Engineer. Use of curing compounds is not
 permitted unless specifically required by the manufacturer of the color additive.

 This work consists of the removal of deteriorated concrete from
 reinforced concrete bridge deck surfaces by the use of hydrodemolition methods, the provision
 of adequate containment measures under the bridge deck, the control and diversion of runoff
 during the hydrodemolition operations, disposal of all concrete and other materials removed by
 hydrodemolition, and all other incidentals as necessary to complete the work in accordance with
 the requirements of these Specifications.
 
 8-191
 
 840.02 EQUIPMENT. The hydrodemolition equipment shall consist of filtering and pumping units
 operating in conjunction with a remote controlled robotic device, and if applicable, shall be
 capable of using river, stream or lake water. The withdrawal of water from any body of water
 under the jurisdiction of the RI Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) or the
 Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) shall not be permitted unless such use is
 authorized by a permit issued by the appropriate regulatory agency.
 The hydrodemolition equipment shall be capable of producing a water jet through an
 orifice at a pressure of at least 17,000 psi. The machine shall move the jet transversely across
 the area and forward or backward so that the entire deck is exposed to the water jet. The
 movement of the jet shall be accomplished by mechanical means; no manual movement of the
 water jet will be allowed except at inaccessible areas such as, but not limited to, proximity to the
 curb and temporary barriers, and at bridge deck expansion joints.
 The equipment shall operate at a noise level of less than 90 decibels at a distance of 50
 feet from either the powerpack unit or the remote robot.
 840.02.1 Controls. The hydrodemolition equipment shall have sufficient controls to control and
 vary the following functions of the machine:
 a.
 b.
 c.
 d.
 
 Water pressure,
 Angle and distance of the orifice relative to the deck surface,
 Limits of transverse and longitudinal movement of the orifice,
 Speed of the orifice in the transverse and longitudinal direction.
 
 840.02.2 Submissions and Qualifications. Post-qualification by the Engineer of the hydrodemolition operation is required. The Contractor shall be responsible for any delay if the postqualification criteria are not satisfied.
 The Contractor shall submit the required post-qualification information on the hydrodemolition operations for approval by the Engineer. The Contractor may submit more than one
 set of documentation.
 a. Minimum Requirements. The post-qualification documentation shall include, as a
 minimum, the following:
 1. The name and location of all projects completed, a brief description of work performed,
 equipment specifications, estimated production rates, and references of personnel.
 2. Specifications for all equipment to be used for the concrete removal, surface
 preparation and clean-up operations.
 3. Anticipated rate of production.
 4. An inventory of all common spare parts and replacement accessories required for the
 equipment.
 5. Number of personnel, machine operators and supervisors, and their relevant
 experience.
 
 8-192
 
 6. Proposed method and sequencing of operation for all phases of the concrete removal
 and surface preparation operations.
 The above post-qualification criteria shall apply regardless of the arrangements made by
 the Contractor to accomplish the hydrodemolition work. It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility
 to insure that subcontractors meet the above post-qualification requirements.
 Approval of the hydrodemolition requirements by the Engineer shall not relieve the
 Contractor of any of his responsibility under the Contract for the timely and successful completion
 of the work.
 840.02.3 Shielding Requirement. Shop drawings showing details, design and catalog cuts for
 the temporary protective shield system shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval at least
 thirty (30) days prior to starting work. This shield system is to protect pedestrians, vehicle and/or
 railroad traffic and utility infrastructure, and to insure that no material or debris associated with
 the hydrodemolition operation falls below the structure. This system shall be designed for the
 anticipated weight of all material to be supported.
 
 840.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS. The concrete shall be removed by hydrodemolition
 equipment which produces a high pressure water stream capable of removing concrete, asphalt,
 oil, dirt, concrete laitance and rust from the exposed reinforcing bars by direct impact. Rotary
 milling or mechanical abrading machines will not be allowed.
 The Contractor shall comply with all applicable regulations and permit requirements with
 respect to the use and disposal of water for hydrodemolition operations.
 840.03.1 Concrete Removal. The hydrodemolition equipment shall be adjusted such that the
 depth of concrete removed from areas of “sound” concrete is approximately ½ inch or as
 specified on the Plans. In areas where deteriorated concrete is encountered, the removal depth
 shall be established by the Engineer.
 The trial test procedure used to assure that the correct amount of sound concrete is
 removed by the hydrodemolition machine shall be as follows: The Engineer will locate and
 record the limits of a trial test of sound concrete approximately 30 square feet in size. An area
 of sound concrete shall be defined as an area free from chemical defects, delamination, spalling
 and/or cracking. To locate and identify the area of sound concrete, the Contractor shall, in the
 presence of the Engineer and following the removal of the bituminous wearing surface, test the
 deck surface for soundness. Chain dragging, tapping with a hammer or other means of testing
 approved by the Engineer will be required. The hydrodemolition machine will then be advanced
 over this area and the operating parameters adjusted to remove 2 inches of sound concrete with
 in the test area. The depth of concrete removal shall be measured by the Engineer. If the
 adjustment is such that the machine is removing too much or too little concrete, the machine will
 be calibrated and the above procedure shall be repeated as many times as necessary to achieve
 the required depth. One (1) test shall be performed for each stage of deck surface concrete
 removal, as shown on the Contract Drawings.
 
 8-193
 
 The equipment shall be operated by qualified personnel certified by the equipment
 manufacturer. Operator certification shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval before
 beginning the concrete removal operation.
 The Contractor shall have available service personnel and an inventory of common wear
 parts and replacement accessories for the equipment to guarantee that the removal operation will
 not be interrupted for an extended period of time in the event of an equipment breakdown.
 A list of operating parameters to be used for the hydrodemolition work shall be submitted
 to the Engineer prior to the commencement of concrete removal.
 Once the operating parameters are established by programming or calibration, they shall
 not be changed as the machine progresses across the bridge deck except to prevent
 unnecessary removal of sound concrete below the required minimum removal depth. If, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, after calibrating the hydrodemolition equipment and beginning production
 work in a particular area, insufficient removal of concrete is being obtained, the Contractor shall
 re-calibrate the equipment for that area to assure removal of concrete to the specified depth.
 Any areas of the prepared surface contaminated as a result of the Contractor’s operations
 by oil or other materials detrimental to maintaining a good bond shall be removed to such depth
 as may be required. Such cleaning or removal shall be performed at no additional cost and the
 Contractor shall be responsible for any resulting delays.
 840.03.2 Control of Debris and Water. The Contractor shall provide structurally adequate
 shields, to be approved by the Engineer, so that the water jet and broken concrete will not be a
 hazard to workers, traffic on adjacent lanes, or pedestrians and property in areas below or
 adjacent to the bridge. The water shall be continually drained from the bridge and shields so that
 excess water will not accumulate, in a manner that will not damage the area below the bridge.
 Broken concrete, asphalt and all other debris shall be removed and transported from the site and
 legally disposed of by the Contractor.
 All debris shall be removed immediately following the hydrodemolition operation by
 employing a vacuum recovery system to prevent re-bonding to the remaining surface. Any debris
 which is allowed to resettle or re-bond to the surface of the sound concrete shall be removed by
 the Contractor at no extra cost to the State. Special care shall be exercised to avoid damage to
 the remaining sound concrete and reinforcing steel.
 Methods for the Control, Maintenance, and Disposal of Hydrodemolition Runoff shall
 conform to the requirements of SECTION 214 of these Specifications.
 The runoff control features shall be in place and operational prior to beginning concrete
 removal. Runoff shall be prevented from running across travel lanes, into bridge drainage
 devices or into areas below or adjacent to the bridge, except for the containment basin.
 840.03.3 Reinforcing Steel. Following the hydrodemolition operation, all exposed reinforcing
 steel shall be inspected to insure that it has been cleaned of all rust and corrosive products,
 including oil, dirt, concrete fragments, laitance, loose scale and other coatings of any character
 8-194
 
 that would destroy or inhibit the bond with the new concrete. Exposed reinforcing steel not
 adequately cleaned by the initial hydrodemolition process shall be re-cleaned to the satisfaction
 of the Engineer. If in the opinion of the Engineer, the bars are deteriorated such that they have
 lost 1/4 or more of their original diameter, the Contractor shall replace the steel as specified in
 accordance with the provisions of either the Contract or SECTION 818; PORTLAND CEMENT
 CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK REPAIR, of these Specifications.
 When cleaned reinforcing steel is exposed for more than seven (7) calendar days,
 measures shall be taken by the Contractor to protect the steel from contamination by the type of
 materials indicated above. Reinforcing steel contaminated as a result of the Contractor’s failure
 to provide adequate protection shall be re-cleaned at no extra cost to the State; any resulting
 delay shall be the Contractor’s responsibility. A light coating of rust can be expected to form on
 the reinforcing; this shall not be considered to constitute contamination.
 840.03.4 Concrete Placement. The placement and finishing of concrete for deck repairs and
 deck overlays shall be as specified in SECTION 818; PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 BRIDGE DECK REPAIR, of these Specifications.
 840.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. “Deck Surface Concrete Removal by Hydrodemolition”
 will be measured by the number of square feet of deck surface actually removed in accordance
 with the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.

 FENCE AND GUARDRAIL, of these Specifications.
 903.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 903.03.1 General. The Contractor shall perform such clearing as may be necessary to construct
 the fence to the required grade and alignment. At locations of small streams or drainage ditches
 where it is not practical to conform the fence to the general contour of the ground surface, the
 Contractor, when directed, shall span the opening below the fence with wire fastened to stakes
 of such length as required. The new fence shall be permanently tied to the terminals of existing
 fences whenever required by the Engineer. When directed, the Contractor will be required to
 stake down the chain link fence at several points between posts. At each location where electric
 transmission or distribution lines cross any of the types of fences covered by this Specification,
 the Contractor shall furnish and install a ground conforming to the requirements of Section 9 of
 the National Electric Safety Code.
 903.03.2 Installing Posts. Posts shall be set in Class A(AE) concrete, unless otherwise
 specified on the Plans. When the Plans require that posts, braces or anchors be imbedded in
 concrete, the Contractor shall install temporary guys, or braces, as may be required to support
 the posts in proper position until such time as the concrete has set sufficiently to anchor said
 posts. No materials shall be installed on posts or strain placed on guys and bracing that are set
 in concrete until directed by the Engineer. Concrete footings shall be carried to the depth and
 dimensions shown on the Plans.
 Where rock is encountered within the required depth to which the post is to be erected,
 a hole of a diameter slightly larger than the largest dimension of the post shall be drilled into the
 rock and the post grouted in. The regular dimensioned concrete footing as shown on the Plans
 shall then be placed between the top of the rock and required grade shown on the Plans.
 All hollow pipe and tube type post shall be fitted with post tops. The bases of the post tops
 shall have flanges which fit around the outside of the posts and shall be secured.
 Unless otherwise specified, tension wires shall be used in sections of chain link fence.
 The top and bottom tension wire shall be placed, stretched taut, and secured at ends to all posts
 in a satisfactory manner before fabric is placed.
 903.03.3 Installing Fabric. The fabric shall be unrolled on the outside of the fence line with the
 bottom edge of the fabric against the posts. The various rolls shall be spliced by bringing the
 9-5
 
 ends close together and weaving in a picket in such a way that will engage both ends of the rolls
 and catch, with each twist, each separate mesh of the picket of both rolls of fabric.
 At end, corner or gate posts, the stretcher bar shall be slipped through the end picket of
 the fabric and the stretcher bar bands at the same time. The bolts in the stretcher bar bands shall
 then be tightened. Additional rolls of fabric shall be spliced and placed as the erection progresses
 along the fence. In long sections, the fence shall be stretched at intervals of about 100 feet.
 The fabric shall be placed by securing one end and applying sufficient tension to remove
 all slack before making attachments elsewhere. After the fabric has been stretched, it shall be
 tied to the tension wire with fabric ties spaced not more than 24 inches apart. The fabric shall
 then be attached to the line posts with fabric ties spaced not more than 14 inches apart. The
 topmost clip shall be placed on the line post as near the top of the fabric as possible, and the
 lowest clip as near the bottom of the fabric as possible. At terminal sections (end, corner and
 pull) and gate posts, the fabric shall be fastened with stretcher bars and bands. The fastenings
 shall be spaced not more than 14 inches on centers for terminal sections (end, corner and pull)
 and gate posts. The topmost band shall be placed on these posts as near the top of the fabric
 as possible and the lowest band as near the bottom as possible.
 Before making a closure, the other end of the run shall be fastened to the end, corner, or
 gate post as described previously. The operation of making a closure of a run shall be as follows.
 The stretching equipment shall be clamped on the ends of the fabric parallel to each other and
 about 5 feet apart when the tension is first applied. The stretching shall continue until the slack
 has been removed from both sections of the fabric. If the ends overlap, the fabric shall be cut to
 match. The ends shall be joined by the insertion of a picket similar to the methods of connecting
 two rolls of fabric.
 903.03.4 Braces. When top rail is not used, braces shall be placed 12 inches down from the top
 of the terminal posts and shall extend from the terminal (end, corner, and pull) post and gate
 posts to the brace post. The braces shall be securely fastened to the post and trussed from
 brace post back to terminal post with round rod and turnbuckle, all as shown on the Plans.
 903.03.5 Gates. The gates shall be hung on gate fittings as shown on the Plans. The lower
 hinge (ball and socket type) shall be placed on top of the concrete in which the gate post is set.
 The sockets for the cone and foot bolt shall be set in concrete so that the plunger pin will fit
 perfectly in the socket when the gate is in a closed position. Gates shall be so erected as to
 swing in the direction indicated and shall be provided with gate stops as specified and as shown
 on the Plans. Gates shall be erected in suitable places as directed by the Engineer or as shown
 on the Plans. All hardware shall be thoroughly secured, properly adjusted and left in perfect
 working order. Hinges and diagonal bracing in gates shall be adjusted so that gates will hang
 level.
 903.03.6 Existing Fence Connection. Wherever a new fence joins an existing fence, either at
 a corner or at the intersection of straight line fences, the corner post with brace post shall be set
 at said junction and braced the same as herein described for corner posts or as shown on the
 Plans. If the connection is made at other than the corner of the new fence, the last span of the
 old fence shall contain a brace span.

 The outer surface of the shell shall be smooth except for purposes of identification. Thin
 untempered glass shall be bonded to the prismatic reflective faces to provide an extremely hard
 and durable abrasion-resistant surface.
 
 9-23
 
 The shell shall be molded of methyl methacrylate conforming to Federal Specification
 L-P-380C, Type I, Class 3.
 The color of the reflective elements when illuminated by an automobile headlight shall be
 white or amber. Off-color reflection shall constitute grounds for rejection.
 The reflectors shall be adhered to the casting, in proper position, at the factory.
 910.02.2 Epoxy Adhesive; Marker to Roadway. The formulation of epoxy adhesive shall
 conform to the requirements of the current issue of AASHTO M237.
 The manufacturer of the RRPM's must approve of the use of any particular formulation
 of epoxy adhesive.
 The epoxy manufacturer shall provide the Engineer with a Certificate of Analysis with the
 delivery of the material. This certificate shall include the formulation of the adhesive as
 determined by Certified Test Data of the component parts and the cured system. Tests shall be
 conducted in accordance with methods set forth in AASHTO M237, current issue.
 The formulation should be for both components and should indicate all its various parts,
 their brand names, producers and percent by weight.
 Certified test data may be provided by either the epoxy adhesive manufacturer or an
 independent testing laboratory. Test results for each individual batch must be provided.
 The Contractor shall also furnish to the Engineer a 1-pint sample of each component from
 the initial batch of epoxy adhesive to be used on the project and each subsequent batch.
 910.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 910.03.1 Surface Preparation. At the time of installation, the metal casting shall be free of dirt,
 oil, grease, rust, moisture or any foreign matter which will impair adhesion to the pavement. It
 shall be the Contractor's responsibility to clean each contaminated casting by sand blasting or
 some other approved method to remove all such foreign matter prior to installation.
 Pavement markers shall not be placed on pavement surfaces that show evidence of
 cracking, checking, spalling or failure of underlying base material.
 If during the laying out process, it is determined that the marker would be installed at a
 point with one of the aforementioned surface defects or at a pavement construction joint, then the
 marker shall be relocated a distance not to exceed 10 percent of the typical marker spacing.
 The minimum pavement surface temperature at the time of application shall be that
 recommended by the epoxy manufacturer. No markers shall be installed if the pavement surface
 or precut slots are wet.
 910.03.2 Installation. Plowable pavement markers shall be installed by inserting the two keels
 of the casting into parallel slots cut into the pavement, said slots to be partially filled with epoxy
 9-24
 
 adhesive, all in accordance with the RRPM manufacturer's recommendations. The markers shall
 be placed no later than seven days after the slots are cut into pavement.
 Before applying the epoxy adhesive, the slots shall be brushed or blown clean of loose
 material and shall be dry. A pre-determined amount of epoxy shall be placed in and between
 the slots to insure that all voids beneath and around the casting are filled so as to create a
 watertight seal around the casting, and yet not produce an excessive overflow resulting in
 unacceptable residue on pavement. The keels of the pavement marker casting shall be hand
 placed into the slots in such a manner as to assure that the tips of the marker's deflecting surface
 are below the pavement surface. The four lugs on the keels of the casting shall be in contact with
 the pavement.
 The epoxy adhesive requires that the mixing operation and placing of the pavement
 markers be accomplished in a timely manner. Any mixed batch that becomes so viscous that it
 cannot be readily extruded from under the marker under light pressure shall not be used. Any
 heating of the epoxy shall be by the application of indirect heat.
 The markers shall be protected against traffic until the adhesive has hardened. The
 following table may be used as a guideline.

 No installations will be made at a lower temperature than 50oF unless the epoxy
 manufacturer can guarantee his product will harden sufficiently at this lower
 temperature to withstand traffic in 45 minutes.
 
 Excess adhesive on the pavement and on the exposed surface of the marker shall be
 immediately removed.
 Any marker leaving a raised end exposed above the pavement must be removed. The
 resulting hole must be filled with an acceptable patch and a new marker properly installed within
 2 feet from the faulty installation.
 910.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. "Raised Reflectorized Pavement Markers (Snow
 Plowable)" will be measured by the number of such units actually furnished and installed in

 911.02.1 General.
 a. Stone. Stone for masonry walls shall conform to the requirements of SECTION M.14;
 STONE FOR MASONRY, of these Specifications.
 b. Mortar. Mortar shall conform to the requirements Subsection M.04.03.5; Mortar, of
 these Specifications.
 911.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 911.03.1 Weather Limitations. Temperature and weather conditions for stone masonry wall
 construction shall conform to the provisions of Subsection 807.03.1 of these Specifications.
 911.03.2 Mixing of Mortar. The requirements for the mixing of mortar shall conform to the
 provisions of Subsection 807.03.2 of these Specifications.
 911.03.3 Selecting and Storing Stone. A sufficient stock of the approved stone shall be kept
 on the site to permit adequate selection and blending of stones by the masons. The stones shall
 be kept free from dirt, oil, or any other injurious material which may prevent the proper adhesion
 of the mortar or detract from the appearance of the exposed surfaces.
 911.03.4 Shaping and Dressing Stones. Selected stone, roughly squared and pitched to line,
 shall be used at all angles and wall ends. All shaping and dressing of stone shall be performed
 before the stone is laid in the wall and no dressing or hammering which will loosen the stone will
 be permitted after it is placed. If a stone is loosened after the mortar is set, it shall be removed,
 the mortar cleaned off, and the stone re-laid in fresh mortar.
 911.03.5 Laying Stone. The wall shall be compactly laid having all vertical joints in the interior
 of the wall completely filled with suitable stones or spalls thoroughly bedded in mortar. Each
 stone to be set in mortar shall be cleaned and thoroughly wetted before being set in a full bed of
 fresh mortar. The stones shall be carefully settled in place before the mortar has set. Any mortar
 9-26
 
 in which initial set has commenced shall be removed from the mixing boards or receptacles and
 not used in the work. No retempering of mortar will be allowed. When laying is interrupted, the
 top courses shall be left unplastered.
 Masonry shall be laid to line and in the pattern required. The stone shall be laid with
 bearing beds parallel to the natural bed of the material. The use of chinking stones in the face
 must be kept to a minimum and will be permitted only in the horizontal joints to provide firm
 bearing of stones. Chinking of vertical joints in the face will not be permitted. Care shall be taken
 to prevent the bunching of small stones or stones of similar size. When weathered or colored
 stones, or stones of varying textures are being used, care must be exercised to distribute the
 various kinds of stones uniformly throughout the exposed faces of the work. The foundation
 (base) of the wall shall be composed of large stones (stones that are distinctly larger than the
 majority of the stones in the wall) that are laid to form a relatively flat surface upon which the
 succeeding courses may be placed. Large stones shall be used for the bottom courses and, in
 general, shall decrease in size from the bottom to the top of the work.
 At least one-fourth of the stones in the face shall be headers (a stone laid with its end
 toward the face of the wall) and these shall be evenly distributed. Headers shall extend not less
 than 12 inches into the core (or the stones that make up the center) of the wall. Headers must
 be uniform in height and width throughout their length. Headers in walls 2 feet or less in
 thickness shall extend entirely through the wall.
 All stones shall be laid to break joints and to thoroughly bond the work. Stones are to be
 placed to form bonds with the stones of adjoining courses of not less than 12 inches in ashlar
 (squared and dressed stone) and split face masonry and 6 inches in rubble masonry. Headers
 shall be placed over stretchers (stones laid with their length parallel to the face of the wall) and,
 in general, the headers of each course shall equally divide the spaces between the headers of
 adjoining courses. No header shall be placed over a joint and no joint shall be made over a
 header. Headers shall be placed in each course and must have a width of not less than 1½ times
 their thickness and must be spaced no further than 8 feet apart, center to center. Stretchers shall
 have a length of bed not less than 2 nor more than 3½ times their thickness, and not less than
 3 feet.
 The tops of walls are to be finished flat. Capstones, if required, are to be flat on the
 upward side and shall not be less than 6 inches in thickness for ashlar and split face masonry and
 3 inches in thickness for rubble masonry. At least one-fourth of the stones used on the top of the
 wall shall be tie stones and shall extend entirely across the top. The remaining stones used in
 constructing the top course must be of a size that allows the top course to be constructed by the
 placement of no more than two stones across the width of the wall, and are to be no less than 8
 inches in width.
 911.03.4 Joints. Joints requiring pointing shall be finished such that the mortared joint is filled
 to the face line of the wall unless otherwise noted on the Plans. The mortar is to be finished such
 that it is pitched downward and away from the center of the wall. Joints on the top of the wall are
 to be pointed flush with the top of the wall and are to be slightly pitched to direct water off of the
 wall. Whenever possible, joints are to be properly pointed before the mortar becomes set. Joints
 which cannot be so pointed shall be prepared for subsequent pointing by raking the mortar out
 to a depth of 2 inches before the mortar has set. Joints not pointed at the time the stones are laid
 shall be thoroughly wet with clean water and filled with mortar. The mortar shall be well driven
 into the joints and finished with a pointing tool which is approved by the Engineer.

 bottom, or foundation, courses shall be composed of large stones and are to be laid to form a
 relatively flat surface upon which the succeeding courses may be placed. The open spaces
 about the foundation (or base) of the wall shall be filled in with suitable material excavated from
 the trench. All stones shall be laid with bearing beds parallel to the natural bed of the material.
 Select stones, roughly squared, are to be used at the ends and at angles in the wall. The
 foundation courses shall consist of the large stones and the thinnest courses shall be placed
 towards the top of the wall.
 The stone wall shall have a width of not less than 24 inches and a height of 3 feet above
 the surrounding ground surface unless otherwise indicated on the Plans. These dimensions may
 be increased or decreased where necessary to conform with adjoining walls which are to remain
 in place, all as directed by the Engineer. If, in order to complete the wall, it becomes necessary
 to use stones other than those which are present in the existing wall, the additional stones shall
 be used in the foundation and distributed evenly throughout the wall.
 Care must be taken to insure that each stone takes a firm bearing at not less than three
 separate points upon the underlying course. Open joints shall be chinked and spalls fitted to
 provide firm bearing throughout the length of the stone. Face joints shall not exceed 1 inch in
 width unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. Chinking will be permitted only in horizontal
 joints in the faces. The chinking of vertical joints in the faces of the wall will not be permitted.
 Header stones shall hold in the heart of the wall and must extend not less than 12 inches
 into the core. They shall occupy not less than one-fourth of the face area of the wall and shall
 be evenly distributed. Header stones in walls, 2 feet or less in thickness, shall extend entirely
 through the wall.
 The top of the wall must be finished flat and shall contain tie stones that extend entirely
 across the width of the wall. Tie stones shall make up no less than one-fourth of the stones in

 bedding must proceed from the bottom up to the top of the slope. At no time will the stone
 bedding be dumped onto the fabric from the top of the slope and allowed to roll down the surface
 of the fabric. Bedding shall be placed in one operation, using methods which will preclude
 segregation of particle sizes within the layer. The surface of the finished layer should be
 reasonably even and free from mounds or windows. Additional layers of bedding material, when
 required, shall be employed which shall preclude the mixing of materials in different layers.
 920.03.4 Dumped Riprap. Stone for riprap shall be placed on the prepared slope or area in a
 manner which will produce an evenly graded mass of stone with the minimum practical
 percentage of voids. The entire mass of stone shall be placed so as to conform with the lines,
 grades, and thicknesses shown on the Plans. Riprap shall be placed to its full course thickness
 in one operation and in such a manner as to avoid displacing the underlying material. Placing
 of riprap in layers, or by dumping into chutes, or by other methods likely to cause segregation will
 not be permitted.
 The larger stones shall be well distributed and the entire mass of stone shall conform to
 the specified gradation as set forth in Subsection M.10.03.2 of these Specifications. All material
 comprising riprap protection shall be placed and distributed to preclude large accumulations of
 either the larger or smaller sizes of stone.

 942.03 CONSTRUCTION METHODS.
 942.03.1 Surface Preparation. The concrete surface should be relatively flat, smooth and dry.
 Fresh concrete requires a full 21-day cure prior to mat installation. Any cracks or holes larger
 than 1/8-inch need to be patched prior to applying ground adhesive. The installation area should
 be prepared by using a wire brush to remove paint, gum and other unwanted materials from the
 surface and sweeping the area to remove all dirt and dust.
 942.03.2 Mat Placement. Place mats in the desired location. If mats need to be cut or shaped,
 make the necessary cuts with a saw or knife and fit each mat into place. Once all mats are in
 position, apply a 2-inch wide strip of duct tape around the entire outer perimeter making sure that
 the tape does not overlap onto the mats, as this will leave an area without glue when the mats
 are installed.
 942.03.3 Adhesive Application. Following the manufacturer’s directions, thoroughly mix equal
 amounts of Part A and Part B of the ground adhesive in an oversize container. Apply the
 adhesive to the entire area inside the taped perimeter using a 3/32-inch notched trowel
 (approximately 10 mil thickness). Be certain that all edges and corners have adequate coverage
 of the ground adhesive. Allow the adhesive to become tacky to the touch, normally about 40
 minutes (see directions on container). Do not allow the adhesive to dry completely.
 942.03.4 Mat Installation. Place mats one at a time in their pre-laid positions. Take care to
 position them tightly against each other, using the tape edge as a guide. Press firmly from the
 center to the outer edges to remove any air bubbles that may have formed. Press on the areas
 between the domes in order to remove all air that may have accumulated under the mats. When
 joining mats together, spot tack the edges together as tightly as possible using drops of seam
 sealer. When the mats are in position, carefully remove the tape from the perimeter. Press down
 the edges and corners of each mat firmly.
 942.03.5 Seam Sealer. Apply a small bead of Seam Seal Adhesive along all joint seams.
 942.03.6 Edge Sealer. Apply a small bead of edge sealer along all outer edges.
 942.03.7 Anchor Installation. After the mats have been completely installed and the ground
 adhesive has set, the nylon anchors can be installed. Using a 1/4-inch masonry bit, drill holes
 through the mats and at least 1 inch into the concrete. Place 1/4" x 1" nylon anchors in the holes
 and tap them in with a hammer. Do not place anchors in the domes. Anchor placement shall be
 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 942.04 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. “Detectable Warning Systems” will be measured by the
 number of square feet of polyurethane mat actually installed in accordance with the Plans and/or
 as directed by the Engineer.
 942.05 BASIS OF PAYMENT. The accepted quantities of “Detectable Warning Systems” will
 be paid for at the contract unit price per square foot as listed in the Proposal. The price so-stated
 shall constitute full and complete compensation for all labor, materials, equipment, and other
 incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted by the Engineer.

 writing by the Engineer.
 T.13.03.2 Inductance Loop Detector Installation. Inductance loops shall be installed in
 accordance with the details specified on the Plans, or as directed by the Engineer. Loop
 dimensions shall be as specified on the Plans. Handholes, conduits and curb cuts shall be
 completed before beginning the loop installation. The loop shall be outlined on the pavement to
 conform to the specified configuration.
 A power saw shall be used to cut a slot in the pavement. The cut shall be of sufficient
 width (min. 3/8") to allow easy placement of loop wire (single or twisted pair) into the saw cut and
 have a depth which will place the last loop turn from 1½-inches to 2½-inches below the final
 surface unless specified otherwise on the Plans. The corners shall be saw cut, cored, drilled or
 chipped out as indicated on the Plans. Sharp edges in the corners shall be smoothed. The intersection of saw cuts shall overlap so that the slots have full depth and a smooth bottom.
 Immediately after sawing, the slot and pavement shall be flushed with high pressure clean
 water to remove the saw slurry. Filtered compressed air shall be used to remove all dust and
 moisture from the slot. The installation shall not proceed until the slot is dry. Hot air may be used
 to dry the saw slot.
 To protect the loop wire at the edge of the pavement or curb, 1-inch minimum diameter
 flexible PVC or vinyl conduit(s) shall be installed between the pavement and handhole, in
 accordance with the details indicated on the Plans.
 The loop wire shall be installed starting at the roadside handhole, around the loop for the
 specified number of turns, and back to the handhole. Splices shall not be permitted outside the
 handhole. The wire shall be depressed in the slot without the use of sharp objects which might
 damage the wire insulation. The loop shall be held in place every 2 feet with 2-inch (approximate)
 strips of open-celled polyurethane backer rod as approved by the Engineer. These hold down
 strips shall be left in place when the slot is filled with roadway loop embedding sealer. Where the
 loop wire crosses pavement joints and cracks, the loop wires shall be further protected using the
 method specified on the Plans.
 The ends of the vinyl or PVC tubing encasing the wire shall be given a waterproof seal
 immediately after placing the wire to prevent moisture from entering the tube. The tubing shall
 be of a continuous length from the curb to the handhole.
 The pair of loop wires between the edge of the loop and the splice to the shielded lead-in
 cable in the handhole shall be twisted together 3 to 5 turns per foot.
 The splice between the loop wires (twisted pair) and the shielded lead-in cable shall be
 moisture proof and shall have a dielectric strength at least equal to that of the original insulation.
 Moisture shall be excluded from the splice during the operation and the work shall be done
 in dry weather or under shelter. All parts of the splice and tools involved shall be clean and dry.
 Individual splices in each wire shall be staggered in a manner so as to minimize the outside
 diameter of the finished splice. The bared conductor ends shall be twisted and soldered and
 reinsulated using an electrical grade fast drying sealant and plastic polyvinyl chloride tape. The
 T-25
 
 reinsulation shall extend approximately one inch onto the adjacent insulation at each end.
 Sufficient layers of tape shall be applied such that the thickness is one and one half times that
 of the original insulation.
 Reinsulation of the outer jacket shall be accomplished in a similar manner except that the
 reinsulation shall extend approximately 4 inches onto the adjacent jacket at each end.
 The shielded lead-in cable shall be continued (no splices) from the splices to the loop
 wires, to the controller cabinet terminals only.
 The completed loop installation, including the shielded lead-in to the controller cabinet,
 shall have a minimum of 50 megohms leakage resistance to ground. This resistance shall be
 tested after the splice is made between the loop wires (twisted pair) and shielded lead-in.
 The Contractor, in addition to measuring the leakage to ground, shall, by test instruments
 capable of measuring electrical values of the installed loop wires and lead-ins, measure induced
 AC voltage, inductance in microhenries, high "Q" indication, and the resistance of the conductors
 in ohms. Upon measuring the loops, the Contractor shall report to the Engineer any unusual
 readings, or readings not in agreement with the calculated values. Testing of the loop may take
 place during or after the installation of the loop. When a loop is found to be not in accordance
 with calculated values, a new loop will be installed in its place at the Contractor's expense.
 The pavement temperatures shall be 40OF and rising before the sealer is placed. All work
 involving the sealer shall be done in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications. When
 the loop embedding sealer has set sufficiently to open the loop to traffic, but the surface remains
 tacky, the loop may be dusted with cement to facilitate opening the loop to traffic.
 T.13.03.3 Pedestrian Detector Installation. Pedestrian pushbuttons shall be installed in
 accordance with Subsection T.10.03 of these Specifications. All pushbuttons, regardless of
 mounting type, shall be mounted at a height of 3 feet 6 inches. The measurement shall be made

 temperature of from 400OF to 440OF, of extruding a line of from 3-to-12 inches in width, and in
 thickness of not less than 1/8-inch nor more than 3/16-inch in thickness, and of generally uniform
 cross section. Material temperature gauges such as a probe type or a remote reading infrared
 thermometer shall be affixed or incorporated in the extrusion shoe in such a manner as to be
 visible and capable of monitoring the composition temperature throughout the marking operation.
 c. Weather Conditions. Thermoplastic pavement markings shall be placed upon dry
 pavement surfaces. At the time of installation, the pavement surface temperature shall be a
 minimum of 50OF and rising.
 1. Option. In the event that the surface temperature is 45OF and rising, the Contractor
 may choose to apply thermoplastic pavement marking material provided that the surface is dry
 and the Contractor accepts all responsibility for the performance of the thermoplastic line striping
 for a period of one year from the date of application. The Contractor shall submit his request in
 writing to the Engineer for approval. Replacement of any thermoplastic material which fails for
 any reason during this one-year period shall be replaced by the Contractor at its own expense.
 No payment will be made for that quantity of material placed at surface temperatures
 below 50OF for the period of one year.
 
 T-43
 
 T.20.03.6 Epoxy Resin Pavement Markings
 a. Equipment. Equipment for the application of epoxy resin traffic stripes or special
 handwork shall consist of one or more mobile, truck-mounted and self-contained pavement
 marking machines, specifically designed to apply epoxy resin striping material and reflective glass
 beads in continuous and skip-line patterns. The equipment shall be capable of applying straight
 and curved lines in a true arc. In addition, the truck-mounted unit shall be provided with
 accessories to allow for the marking of legends, symbols, crosswalks, and other special patterns.
 At any time throughout the duration of the project, the Contractor shall provide free access to the
 equipment for inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer may approve the use of a portable
 applicator in lieu of mobile truck-mounted accessories for use in applying special markings only,
 provided such equipment can demonstrate satisfactory application of reflectorized epoxy
 markings in accordance with these Specifications.
 The application equipment shall be capable of installing a minimum of 10 miles of epoxy
 reflectorized pavement markings in an eight hour day and shall include the following features:
 1. Individual material reservoirs for the storage of each of the components and each type
 of glass beads.
 2. Heating element of sufficient capacity to maintain the individual epoxy resin
 components at the manufacturer’s recommended temperature for spray application.
 3. Two separate gravity type glass beads dispensers capable of uniformly applying glass
 beads to epoxy resin traffic stripes at the rate required.

 components being fed to the spray nozzle. The devices should be visible to the operator while
 the equipment is in use and can be capable of displaying the proportioning such that the actual
 mixing ratio can be determined at all times.
 5. Accurately calibrated, tamper-proof, metering type devices that measure and record
 the number of gallons of epoxy resin material used and corresponding length of stripe(s) applied.
 Each application gun shall have individual footage accumulators which are activated only when
 material is being applied. This information shall be provided in a format that permits a direct
 determination of the yield (average mil thickness) of the applied materials.
 6. All applicator guns on the spray carriages shall be in full view of the operator during
 operation. The equipment shall be capable of placing two lines simultaneously with either line
 a solid or intermittent pattern in yellow or white. When the color of the material is changed, a
 quantity of material equal to 150 linear feet of stripe(s) shall be wasted to eliminate the chance
 of contamination of the alternate color.
 7. An air pressure nozzle directed to the area to be striped to permit cleaning of the road
 surface immediately prior to application of the material. The pressure in the line shall be a
 minimum of 175 psi.
 8. When working on a roadway with more than one lane in either direction, the applicator
 truck shall have a permanently mounted, variable direction, illuminated arrow board, fully
 operational and visible to approaching traffic.
 T-44
 
 b. General. Before any pavement marking work is begun, a schedule of operations shall
 be submitted for the approval of the Engineer. At least 5days prior to starting striping, the
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with the epoxy manufacturer’s written instructions for use,
 including but not limited to, material mixing rations and application temperatures.
 When pavement markings are applied under traffic flow conditions, the Contractor shall
 provide all necessary signs, cones, arrow boards, etc., in accordance with the contract provisions
 and the latest edition of the MUTCD to maintain and protect the traffic, the marking operation, and
 the pavement markings until thoroughly set.
 The application of pavement markings shall be performed in the general direction of traffic.
 Striping against the flow of traffic will not be allowed.
 If, for any reason, it is not possible to place epoxy lane and center lines within the
 guidelines and restrictions of the contract, and no previous lines exist, the Contractor, at his
 expense, shall place the appropriate color of four-inch reflective temporary pavement markings
 for the entire length of the roadway that is unstriped in accordance with the latest edition of the
 MUTCD. The temporary pavement markings and possible subsequent removal shall be at the
 Contractor’s expense. The type of temporary markings will be approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for removing, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, all
 tracking marks, spilled epoxy, and epoxy markings applied in unauthorized areas.
 c. Test Strip and Calibration. Prior to the start of striping operations, one or more test
 strips shall be constructed. Each test strip shall consist of approximately 100 linear feet of
 pavement with white and yellow striping (lane and edgeline) similar to that required for the project.
 The purpose of the test strip(s) is to demonstrate the capability of the proposed epoxy resin
 striping material, the equipment and procedures to place epoxy resin traffic stripes that comply
 with these Specifications including, but not limited to, retroreflectivity, dimensions, appearance
 (uniform color and crisp, well-defined edges), wet film thickness, drying time and glass bead
 quantity, application and retention. When the test strips are in compliance, the Contractor will be
 permitted to proceed with the striping operations.
 A test strip shall be required for each applicator unit used. Additional test strips may be
 required when major equipment repairs or adjustments are made, or at any time requested by
 the Engineer.
 d. Procedures. The road surface shall be cleaned and free from all dirt, oil, grease and
 other foreign material, including curing compound on new Portland cement concrete, immediately
 prior to the striping operation. New epoxy markings may be applied over worn, well-bonded
 epoxy if approved by the Engineer; all others, such as (but not limited to) thermoplastic, tape, and
 newly striped paint will be removed as follows and as approved by the Engineer:
 1. Grinding. Markings shall be removed to a minimum of 95 percent of their surface
 area. The method shall not damage the surface in any way and have no more than a moderate
 color and/or texture change. The grinding truck must be capable of removing 80,000 linear feet
 of 6-inch line per day; and must be equipped with a vacuum and dust collector that is 99.99
 percent efficient in removing particles no bigger than 0.5 microns. Any pavement markings
 removed must be replaced within 1 day. Removal is at no extra cost. A sweeper with the
 
 T-45
 
 capacity to pick up grindings simultaneously with the removal operation is required. If the
 Contract eliminates grinding of material, power washing remains a requirement.
 2. Power Wash. All special patterns, handwork, and oil or other deleterious substances
 shall be removed by a power wash machine with a pressure of 2400-2800 psi with the water
 heated to 180-195OF. No chemicals shall be added to the water in the process. The machine
 will be equipped with a turbo blast tip with oscillating head and shall be capable of supplying 5
 gallon/minute/gun.
 Pavement cleaning shall consist of at least a brushing with a rotary, non-metallic broom
 and additionally as may be recommended by the material manufacturer, all to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer. New Portland cement concrete shall be cleaned by sandblasting to remove any
 surface treatments and/or laitance. Surface cleaning and preparation work shall be performed
 only in the area of the epoxy markings applications. The pavement surface shall be air-blasted
 to remove dirt and residues just prior to the application of the markings.
 e. Restrictions. Epoxy striping material shall be applied to substantially dry pavement
 surfaces. The pavement surface temperature and the ambient temperature shall be a minimum
 of 35OF at time of application. Operations shall neither start nor be continued during periods of
 rain or in the case of damp pavement. Operations shall not continue until the Engineer
 determines that the roadway surface is dry enough to achieve adhesion.
 The individual epoxy components shall be heated to the temperatures recommended in
 the epoxy manufacturer’s written instructions for use or as stated in the FHWA Standard
 Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects (note
 maximum temperature of 140OF).
 The ratio of the two components shall be monitored during the application, using the
 installed metering devices. Should the ratio fall outside the range of ±5 percent of the
 manufacturer’s specified mixing ratio for over 30 seconds or at any time fall outside the range of
 ±10 percent, the application shall be stopped and the cause of the problem determined and
 corrected before proceeding.
 f. Application. Epoxy pavement markings must be reflectorized for night visibility by
 adding reflective spheres before the paint dries or sets, by the double-drop method. The
 reflective spheres, Type I followed immediately by Type II, shall be evenly dispersed on a
 minimum wet film thickness of 20 mils on existing and new pavements at a minimum rate of 12
 pounds per gallon for each type of glass sphere. All special patterns and handwork (i.e., stop
 bars, arrows, legends, symbols, etc.) shall meet the above application rates with the following
 exception: The double-drop application of glass spheres will use the Type II gradation only with
 two applications at a minimum of 12 pounds per gallon each.
 The Contractor shall place necessary spotting at appropriate points to provide horizontal
 control for striping and to determine necessary starting and stopping points. Longitudinal joints,
 pavement edges and existing markings shall serve as horizontal control when approved by the
 Engineer.
 Epoxy reflectorized pavement markings shall be placed at the width, thickness, and
 pattern designated by the Contract Documents. Marking operations shall not begin until
 applicable surface preparation work is completed and approved by the Engineer, and the
 T-46
 
 atmospheric conditions and pavement surface temperature are acceptable to the Engineer. The
 temperature of the mixed epoxy may be adjusted as required for prevailing conditions, including
 air temperature and pavement temperature to achieve the prescribed no-track time. The speed
 of the applicator truck shall not exceed the recommended rate for the combination of the truck
 rate, pressure in the lines, and the tip opening and height of the spray gun to insure the required
 thickness.
 g. Quality Assurance. A tolerance of 1/4-inch under or over the specified width will be
 allowed for striping provided the variation is gradual and does not detract from the general
 appearance. Alignment deviations for the control guide shall not exceed 2 inches provided the
 variation is gradual and does not detract from the general appearance. Material shall not be
 applied over a longitudinal joint. Establishment of these tolerances shall not relieve the
 Contractor of his responsibility to comply as closely as practicable with the planned dimensions.
 Retroreflection shall be measured using a 30-meter geometry portable unit following
 ASTM D6359 with the following exceptions: minimum values shall not be less than 350
 mcd/lum/m2 for white and 225 mcd/lum/m2 for yellow as measured by the Engineer; and
 measurement for acceptance shall be performed between 14 and 60 days after placement.
 Epoxy reflectorized pavement markings, which after application and curing are determined
 by the Engineer to be defective and not in conformance with this Specification, shall be repaired.
 Repair of defective markings shall be the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be performed
 to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no additional cost to the State. Repair methods shall be
 detailed and submitted for approval to the Engineer prior to corrective action.
 T.20.03.7 Symbols and Word Messages. Symbols and word messages shall be applied to the
 pavement where designated on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. The letters shall be
 elongated in the direction of traffic as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.

 SECTION M.02
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 
 M.02.01 HYDRAULIC CEMENT
 M.02.01.1 Portland Cement. Portland cement shall conform both to the chemical and physical
 requirements of AASHTO M85 and be listed on the Department's Approved Materials List.
 In addition, the cement shall conform to the following requirements:
 1. The cement shall not contain more than 0.60 percent by weight of alkalies, calculated
 as the percentage of Na2O plus 0.658 times the percentage of K2O, when determined by either
 direct intensity flame photometry or by the atomic absorption method. The instrument and
 procedure used shall be qualified as to precision and accuracy in accordance with the requirements
 of ASTM C114.
 The Engineer may raise the maximum alkali content of the cement to 0.75 percent for
 concrete that uses non-expansive aggregate or aggregate considered innocuous based upon
 acceptable values for test methods ASTM C1260 or AASHTO T303. Test results must be
 submitted and approved by the Engineer before this is permitted.
 To propose an increase to maximum alkalies, the Contractor must submit an independent
 testing laboratory results of ASTM C1260; “Potential Alkali Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar Bar
 Method)” or AASHTO T303; “Accelerated Detection of Potentially Deleterious Expansion of Mortar
 Bars Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction.” For either test, mean expansion of the test specimens of less
 than 0.10 percent at 16 days from casting will suffice to indicate that the aggregate is non-reactive
 and will validate the use of a cement which has an alkali content not to exceed 0.75 percent by
 weight of alkalies.
 If the ASTM C1260 or AASHTO T303 test results do not indicate that the aggregate is nonreactive or are inconclusive, the Contractor may submit to the Engineer results of ASTM C289;
 “Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method),” ASTM C227; “Potential Alkali
 Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar Bar Method),” and ASTM C295;
 “Petrographic Examination of Aggregates for Concrete.”
 Petrographic analysis in accordance with ASTM C595 shall identify the constituents of the
 fine and coarse aggregate. Fine and coarse aggregate containing more than the following
 quantities of constituents shall be considered potentially reactive:
 Optically strained, microfractured, or microcrystalline quartz exceeding 5.0 percent (a
 common constituent of granite and granite gneiss).
 Chert or chalcedony exceeding 3.0 percent.
 Tridymite or cristobalite exceeding 1.0 percent.
 Opal exceeding 0.5 percent.
 Natural volcanic glass in volcanic rocks exceeding 3.0 percent.
 
 M-6
 
 Mortar bar expansion measurements (ASTM C227) are to be made at three months and at
 six months and the results shall be submitted to the Engineer at those times. The guidelines in the
 appendix to ASTM C33; “Standard Specification for Concrete Aggregates“ will be followed to
 determine whether an aggregate is non-expansive or innocuous. The guidelines state that
 expansion will be considered excessive at three months if it exceeds 0.05 percent, but that an
 expansion greater than 0.05 percent at three months will not be considered excessive if the sixmonth expansion remains below 0.10 percent.
 The petrographic examination (C295), chemical method (C289), and the six-month mortar
 bar expansion (C227) will be definitive. However, interim acceptability based on the petrographic
 analysis, the chemical method and the three-month mortar bar expansion will be considered until
 the six-month test is complete. Such interim acceptance will be granted only when the previous
 year’s six-month mortar bar expansion results were satisfactory.
 Documentation from an independent laboratory certifying that the aggregate is nonexpansive and innocuous must be submitted to the Engineer annually. An acceptable independent
 testing laboratory shall conduct each test.
 Analysis to document alkali content and conformance to AASHTO M85 must be included
 on all mill test reports submitted to this office.
 2. The autoclave expansion shall not exceed 0.50 percent when tested in accordance with
 AASHTO T107.
 M.02.01.2 Blended Hydraulic Cements. Blended hydraulic cements shall both conform to the
 chemical and physical requirements of AASHTO M240 and be listed on the Department's
 Approved Materials List.
 M.02.01.3 Masonry Cement. Masonry cement shall both conform to ASTM C91 and be listed on
 the Department's Approved Materials List.
 
 M.02.02 FINE AGGREGATE FOR CONCRETE. Fine aggregate for concrete shall conform to the
 requirements of AASHTO M6 and shall consist of natural sand, manufactured sand produced from
 larger aggregate, or a combination thereof. Manufactured sand shall be graded with a minimum
 percentage of flat elongated particles. All fine sand shall consist of hard, strong, durable particles
 which are free from coatings or any injurious materials and injurious amount of clay, loam, or other
 deleterious substances. In addition the fine aggregate shall not contain substances which, when
 mixed in Portland cement concrete, produce an unacceptable level of chloride ions in the final
 product. Substances that produce chloride ions shall be considered deleterious material. Any fine
 aggregate may be rejected if it is determined by the Engineer to contain sufficient amounts of
 unsound or deleterious material to be harmful.
