PREFACE
These Standard Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects are
issued primarily for constructing roads and bridges on Federal Highway projects under the direct
administration of the Federal Highway Administration. These specifications are cited as "FP-14"
indicating "Federal Project" Standard Specifications issued in 2014 and contain both United States
Customary and Metric units of measure.
When designated in a contract, the FP-14 becomes part of the contract and binding upon all parties to the
contract. Construction contracts of the Federal Highway Administration are also governed by the
following regulations:
● Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1; and
● Transportation Acquisition Regulation (TAR), Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 12.
The FAR and TAR regulations are not included in the FP-14. A complete copy of the FAR is available
from the Superintendent of Documents, Congressional Sales Office, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402.
U.S. Customary units of measure are used in the FP-14 as provided in the November 25, 2008
Memorandum from Jeffrey F. Paniati entitled Update on Metric Use Requirements for FHWA Documents.
Metric units are noted in parentheses following the U.S. Customary Units. The references to Metric or
Metric units apply only when the project or portion of the project expressly calls for Metric units of
measure.

Section 103. — SCOPE OF WORK
103.01 Intent of Contract. The intent of the contract is to provide for the construction and completion of
the work described. The precise details of performing the work are not described, except as considered
essential for the successful completion of the work. Furnish labor, material, equipment, tools,
transportation, and supplies necessary to complete the work according to the contract.
103.02 Disputes. Follow the requirements of FAR Clause 52.233-1 Disputes (Alternate I).
When requesting a CO's decision on an interpretation of contract terms for the recovery of increased costs;
quantify the amount and certify the amount if required by FAR Clause 52.233-1 Disputes (Alternate I).
Include an explanation of the interpretation of contract terms, the contract clause under which the claim is
made, supporting documentation, and adequate cost data to support the amount claimed.
103.03 Value Engineering.

of

FAR

Clause

52.248-3

Value

Before undertaking significant expenditures, submit a written description of the value engineering change
proposal (VECP) concept. Within 14 days the CO will inform the Contractor as to whether the concept
appears to be viable or if the concept is unacceptable. If the CO indicates that the concept appears to be
viable, prepare and submit the formal VECP proposal.
103.04 Contractor Records. Upon request, provide records related to the contract to the Government for
up to 3 years after final payment or for longer periods as provided by law.
Include a provision in subcontracts at all tiers giving the Government the same rights as provided above
with respect to the subcontractor's records.
103.05 Partnering. To facilitate this contract, the CO offers to participate in a formal partnership with the
Contractor. This partnership draws on the strengths of each organization to identify and achieve reciprocal
goals. Partnering strives to resolve problems in a timely, professional, and non-adversarial manner. If
problems result in disputes, partnering encourages, but does not require, alternative dispute resolution
instead of the formal claim process. The objective is effective and efficient contract performance to
achieve a quality project within budget and on schedule.
Acceptance of this partnering offer by the Contractor is optional, and the partnership is bilateral.
If the partnering offer is accepted, mutually agree with the CO on the level of organizational involvement
and the need for a professional to facilitate the partnering process. Engage the facilitator and other
resources for key Contractor representatives and the CO to attend a partnership development and
team-building workshop usually between the time of award and the Notice to Proceed. Hold additional
progress meetings upon mutual agreement.

14

Section 103

The direct cost of partnering facilities, professional facilitation, copying fees, and other miscellaneous
costs directly related to partnering meetings will be shared by the Contractor and Government. Secure and
pay for facilities, professional fees, and miscellaneous requirements. Submit invoices to the CO. The
Government will reimburse the Contractor for 50 percent of the agreed costs incurred for the partnering
process. The Government’s share will not exceed $5,000.
Each party is responsible for making and paying for its own travel, lodging, and meal arrangements. No
time extension for the completion of the project will be made for the use of partnering.

104.04 Coordination of Contract Documents. The FAR, TAR, special contract requirements, plans, and
standard specifications are contract documents. A requirement in one document is binding as though
occurring in all the contract documents. The contract documents are intended to be complementary and to
describe and provide for a complete contract. In case of discrepancy, calculated and shown dimensions
govern over scaled dimensions. The contract documents govern in the following order:
(a) Federal Acquisition Regulations;
(b) Transportation Acquisition Regulations;
(c) Special contract requirements;
(d) Plans; and
(e) Standard specifications.
104.05 Load Restrictions. Follow the requirements of FAR Clause 52.236-10 Operations and Storage
Areas.
Comply with legal load restrictions when hauling material and equipment on public roads and bridges to
and from the project. A special permit does not relieve the Contractor of liability for damage resulting
from the moving of material or equipment.
Unless otherwise permitted, do not operate equipment or vehicles that exceed the legal load limits over
new or existing structures, or pavements within the project; except those pavements to be removed during
the same construction season.

21

Section 105

Section 105. — CONTROL OF MATERIAL
105.01 Source of Supply and Quality Requirements. Follow the requirements of FAR Clause 52.236-5
Material and Workmanship.
Select sources and submit acceptable material. Notify the CO of proposed sources before delivery to the
project to expedite material inspection and testing. Do not incorporate material requiring submittal into the
work until approved.
Material may be approved at the source of supply before delivery to the project. Approval of a material
source does not constitute acceptance of material submitted from the source. If an approved source fails to
supply acceptable material during the life of the project, further use of that source may be denied.
Submit samples of material for source quality verification testing for material required to conform to
Sections 703, 704, and 705.
105.02 Material Sources.
(a) Government-provided sources. The Government will acquire the permits and rights to remove
material from provided sources identified in the contract and to use such property for a plant site and
stockpiles. Test reports and available historical material data will be furnished to the Contractor upon
request.
Do not perform work within a source until a source development plan is approved. Allow 7 days for
approval. Include the following as applicable:
(1) Requirements of written agreements;
(2) Requirements in Sections 107, 157, 204, 205, 624, and 625;
(3) Source development details;
(4) Restoration details; and
(5) Abandonment details.
Perform work necessary to produce acceptable material including work required by the approved
source development plan.
The quality of material is generally acceptable. Variations in quality should be expected as it is not
feasible to ascertain the quality of material for an entire deposit from exploratory samples. Determine
the quantity, type of equipment, and work necessary and produce acceptable material to be
incorporated into the work. Do not perform aggregate source quality tests listed in the Sampling,
Testing, and Acceptance Requirements table of other Sections when using Government-provided
sources. Perform quality control sampling and testing according to the approved Contractor Quality
Control Plan in Section 153 and the applicable Sampling, Testing, and Acceptance Requirements
tables included at the end of each Section. Allow the CO the opportunity to witness sampling and
splitting of the test material.

22

Section 105

(b) Government-provided material stockpile. The quality of the material in the stockpile has been
preapproved unless otherwise noted and is considered acceptable for the application for which it has
been designated. Perform quality control sampling and testing according to the approved Contractor
Quality Control Plan in Section 153 and the applicable Sampling, Testing, and Acceptance
Requirements table included at the end of each Section. Test results submitted will be for the
Government’s information only. Allow the CO the opportunity to witness sampling and splitting of the
test material.
(c) Contractor-located sources. The Contractor is responsible for Contractor-located material
sources, including established commercial material sources. Use sources that fulfill the contract
quantity and quality requirements. Determine the quantity, type of equipment, and work necessary to
select and produce an acceptable material. Secure permits and clearances for use of the source and
submit copies of the documents to the CO. Follow the environmental requirements of Subsection
107.10(d). Submit available historical data indicating acceptable material can be produced from the
source. Perform quality control sampling and testing according to the approved Contractor Quality
Control Plan in Section 153, aggregate source quality tests, and applicable Sampling, Testing, and
Acceptance Requirements table included at the end of each Section. Allow the CO the opportunity to
witness sampling and splitting of the test material.
105.03 Material Source Management. Notify the CO at least 14 days before starting operations in the
source. Develop and operate according to the approved source development plan for
Government-provided sources or written agreement for Contractor-located sources.
Before developing a material source, measure the sediment content of bodies of water adjacent to the work
area that will receive drainage from the work area. Perform erosion and sediment control according to the
source development plan and the "Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)" or "Erosion Control
Plan".
Do not remove material measured in-place from borrow sources or Government-provided stockpiles until
initial ground survey measurements have been taken according to Subsection 204.16(b) and approved.
Perform final ground survey measurements according to Subsection 204.16(b).
Dispose of rejected material in an approved manner.
105.04 Handling and Storing Material. Handle and store material to preserve its quality and fitness for
the work. Stored material approved before storage may again be inspected before use in the work. Locate
stored material to facilitate prompt inspection.
Use only approved portions of the right-of-way for storing material or equipment. Provide additional space
as needed. Do not use private property for storage without written permission of the owner or lessee.
Submit copies of agreements and documents.
Provide security for stored material.
Restore Government-provided storage sites to their original condition.

23

Section 105

105.05 Use of Material Found in the Work. Stone, gravel, sand, or other material found in the
excavation may be used for another pay item when approved. If material found in the excavation is used
for another pay item, material will be paid both as excavation and as the other pay item for which it is
used. Replace excavation used with acceptable material at no cost to the Government. Excavate or remove
material only from within the grading limits, as indicated by the slope and grade lines.
The right to use and process material found in the work excludes the use and processing of material for
nongovernment contract work, except for the disposal of waste material. If the Contractor produces or
processes material from Government lands in excess of the quantities required for the contract, the
Government may:
(a) Take possession of the excess material and direct its use, paying the Contractor only for the cost of
production or
(b) Require removal of the material and restoration of the land to a satisfactory condition at no cost to
the Government.
105.06 Material Source Restoration. Restore Government-provided sources according to the approved
source development plan. Restack the unused portion of the Government-provided stockpiles upon
completion of the work at no cost to the Government. Do not measure restoration of material sources for
payment.

24

Section 106

Section 106. — ACCEPTANCE OF WORK
106.01 Conformity with Contract Requirements. Follow the requirements of FAR Clause 52.246-12
Inspection of Construction.
References to standard documents and test methods of AASHTO, ASTM, GSA, and other recognized
standard authorities refer to the documents and methods in effect on the date of the Invitation for Bids
(IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).
Use the FLH, Field Materials Manual (FMM), Appendix B: FLH Test Methods in effect on the date of the
IFB or RFP. Electronic copies of the FLH Test Methods and FHWA forms can be downloaded from:
http://flh.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/manuals/fmm/
Specification limits, tolerances, test results, and related calculations are according to ASTM E29, Absolute
Method.
Perform work to the lines, grades, cross-sections, dimensions, and processes or material requirements
shown in the contract.
Incorporate manufactured material into the work according to the manufacturer’s recommendations or to
these specifications, whichever is stricter.
When standard manufactured items are specified (such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, and pipe
conduits that are identified by gauge, density, or section dimensions) the identification will be considered
to be nominal masses or dimensions. Unless specific contract tolerances are noted, established
manufacturing tolerances will be accepted.
Plan dimensions and contract specification values are the values to be strived for and complied with as the
design values from which deviations are allowed. Perform work and provide material that is uniform in
character and reasonably close to the prescribed value or within the specified tolerance range. The purpose
of a tolerance range is to accommodate occasional minor variations from the median zone that are
unavoidable for practical reasons.
The Government may inspect, sample, or test work before final acceptance of the project. If the
Government tests work, copies of test reports are furnished to the Contractor upon request. Government
tests may or may not be performed at the work site.
If Government testing is performed on work, the result will be used for acceptance purposes under
Subsection 106.04.
Do not rely on the availability of Government test results for process control.
Acceptable work conforming to the contract will be paid for at the contract unit bid price. Four methods of
determining conformity and accepting work are described in Subsections 106.02 through 106.05. The
primary method of acceptance is specified in each Section of work, but work may be rejected if it is found
not to comply with the contract.

25

Section 106

For work that is evaluated and accepted under Subsection 106.05, if Contractor testing and inspection is
verified by the Government, the Contractor’s results may be used by the Government to evaluate work
for acceptance. Contractor data will be verified using the F- and t-test statistics in comparison to
Government test results at a significance level of 0.01. If the Contractor’s data is not verified and the CO
determines it to be appropriate, the Government will perform tests associated for that discrete portion of
work. In this situation, the Government test results will control in determining the acceptability and pay
factor of the work.
Remove and replace work that does not conform to the contract, or to prevailing industry standards where
no specific contract requirements are noted, at no cost to the Government.
As an alternative to removal and replacement, the Contractor may submit a written request to:
(a) Have the work accepted at a reduced price; or
(b) Perform corrective measures to bring the work into conformity.
Include supporting rationale and documentation in the request. Include references or data justifying the
proposal based on an evaluation of test results, effect on service life, value of material or work, quality,
aesthetics, and other tangible engineering basis. The CO will determine disposition of the nonconforming
work.
106.02 Visual Inspection. Acceptance is based on visual inspection of the work for compliance with the
contract and prevailing industry standards.
106.03 Certification. For material manufactured off-site, use a manufacturer with an ISO 9000
certification or an effective testing and inspection system. Require the manufacturer to clearly mark the
material or packaging with a unique product identification or specification standard to which it is
produced.
Other than references in or to the FAR or Federal Law, when these Standard Specifications or Special
Contract Requirements reference certifications, certificates or certified documents, equipment or
individuals; these references refer to documentation of non-regulatory, peripheral contract requirements
that are required to be validated by an individual or organization having unique knowledge or
qualifications to perform such validation.
Check certifications before incorporating the material into the work to ensure that the requirements of
the contract have been met. Mark the certifications with the following information:
•

Project number and name;

•

Pay item number and description;

•

Contractor’s signature; and

•

Date.

Material accepted by certification may be sampled and tested. If material is determined not to conform
with the contract, the material will be rejected whether in place or not.

26

Section 106

One of the following certifications may be required:
(a) Production certification. Material requiring a production certification is identified in the
Acceptance Subsection of each Section. Submit a production certification from the manufacturer for
each shipment of material. Include the following:
(1) Date and place of manufacture;
(2) Lot number or other means of cross-referencing to the manufacturer’s inspection and testing
system; and
(3) Substantiating evidence that the material conforms to the contract quality requirements as
required by FAR 46.105(a)(4), including the following:
(a) Test results on material from the same lot and documentation of the inspection and testing
system;
(b) A statement from the manufacturer that the material complies with the contract; and
(c) Manufacturer’s signature or other means of demonstrating accountability for the
certification.
(b) Commercial certification. Submit one commercial certification for similar material from the same
manufacturer.
A commercial certification is a manufacturer’s or Contractor's representation that the material
complies with the contract. The representation may be labels, catalog data, stamped specification
standards, or supplier's certifications indicating the material is produced to a commercial standard or
specification.
106.04 Measured or Tested Conformance. Perform necessary measurements and tests to ensure work
complies with the contract.
Use prevailing industry standards in the absence of contract requirements or tolerances.
Submit measurements, tests, and supporting data for acceptance.
106.05 Statistical Evaluation of Work and Determination of Pay Factor. Statistical evaluation of work
is a method of analyzing inspection or test results to determine conformity with the contract. The work will
be accepted as follows:
(a) General. For work evaluated based on statistical evaluation, both the Government and Contractor
assume some risk.
The Government's risk is the probability that work of a rejectable quality level is accepted. The
Contractor's risk is either the probability that work produced at an acceptable quality level (AQL) is
rejected (α) or the probability that the work produced at the AQL is accepted at less than the contract
unit bid price (α100).

27

Section 106

Acceptable quality level is the lowest percentage of work within the specification limits that is
considered acceptable for payment at contract unit bid price. There are two categories:
•

Category I is based on an AQL of 95 percent.

•

Category II is based on an AQL of 90 percent.

In both cases, the Contractor's risk (α100) is 5 percent and the risk of rejection (α) is significantly
lower.
As an incentive to produce uniform quality work and to offset the Contractor's risk, a final payment
greater than the contract unit bid price may be obtained under certain conditions.
The quality characteristics to be evaluated, sampling frequency, sampling location, test methods, and
category are listed in the Acceptance Subsection of each Section. The following applies:
(1) Lot size. A lot is a discrete quantity of work to which the statistical evaluation procedure is
applied. A lot normally represents the total quantity of work produced. More than one lot may
occur if changes in the target values, material sources, or job-mix formula are requested in
writing and approved.
(2) Sampling frequency. The frequency rate shown normally requires at least 5 samples. The
minimum required to perform a statistical evaluation is 3 samples. The maximum obtainable pay
factor with 3, 4, or 5 samples is 1.01. At least 8 samples are required to obtain a 1.05 pay factor.
If the sampling frequencies and quantity of work would otherwise result in fewer than 8 samples;
submit a written request to increase the sampling frequency to provide for at least 8 samples.
Submit the request to increase the sampling frequency at least 48 hours before beginning
production. An increase in the sampling frequency may result in a reduced pay factor.
(3) Sampling location. The exact location of sampling will be determined by the CO based on
random numbers.
(4) Specification limits. The specification limits for the quality characteristics are listed in the
contract for the work in question.
(b) Acceptance. The work in the lot will be paid for at a final pay factor when all inspections or test
results are completed and evaluated.
Before determining the final pay factor, the work may be incorporated into the project provided the
current pay factor does not fall below 0.90. If a lot is concluded with fewer than 3 samples, the
material will be evaluated under Subsection 106.04.
If the current pay factor of a lot falls below 0.90, end production. Production may resume after the
Contractor takes effective and acceptable actions to improve the quality of the production.
A lot containing an unsatisfactory percentage of non-specification material (less than 1.00 pay factor)
is accepted provided the lowest single pay factor has not fallen into the reject portion of Table 106-2.
A lot containing an unsatisfactory percentage of non-specification material with the lowest single pay
factor falling into the reject portion of Table 106-2 is rejected. Remove rejected material from the
work.
28

Section 106

When approved, it is permissible to voluntarily remove non-specification material and replace it with
new material to avoid or minimize a pay factor of less than 1.00. New material will be sampled, tested,
and evaluated according to this Subsection.
Any quantity of material may be rejected based on visual inspection or test results. Do not incorporate
rejected material in the work. The results of tests run on rejected material will be excluded from the lot.
(c) Statistical evaluation. The Variability-Unknown/Standard Deviation Method will be used to
determine the estimated percentage of the lot that is within specification limits.
The estimated percentage of work that is within the specification limits for each quality characteristic
will be determined as follows:
(1) Calculate the arithmetic mean ( x ) of the test values: x = ∑ x
n

where: ∑ = summation of:
x = individual test value
n = total number of test values
(2) Calculate the standard deviations:
s=

( )

n ∑ x 2 − (∑ x )
n(n − 1)

2

where: ∑(x2) = summation of the squares of individual test values
(∑x)2 = summation of the individual test values squared
(3) Calculate the upper quality index (QU): QU =

USL - x
s

where: USL = upper specification limit
Note: The USL is equal to the contract specification limit or the target value plus the allowable
deviation.
x − LSL
(4) Calculate the lower quality index (QL): QL =
s
where: LSL = lower specification limit
Note: The LSL is equal to the contract specification limit or the target value minus the allowable
deviation.
(5) From Table 106-1, determine PU (the estimated percentage of work within the USL).
PU corresponds to a given QU. If a USL is not specified, PU is 100.
(6) From Table 106-1, determine PL (the estimated percentage of work within the lot within the
LSL). PL corresponds to a given QL. If an LSL is not specified, PL is 100.
(7) Calculate the total estimated percentage of work within the USL and LSL:
PU + PL - 100
(8) Repeat steps 1 through 7 for each quality characteristic listed for statistical evaluation.

33

Section 106

(d) Pay factor determination (value of the work). The pay factor for a lot will be determined as
follows:
(1) The pay factor for each quality characteristic will be determined from Table 106-2 using the
total number of test values and the total estimated percentage within the specification limits from
Subsection 106.05(c)(7).
(2) When all quality characteristics for a lot are Category I, the lot pay factor is based on the
lowest single pay factor for any Category I quality characteristic. The maximum obtainable pay
factor is 1.05.
(3) When quality characteristics for a lot are both Category I and II, the lot pay factor is based on
the following:
(a) When all Category II quality characteristics are 1.00, the lot payment is based on the
lowest single pay factor for all Category I characteristics. The maximum obtainable pay
factor is 1.05.
(b) When any Category II quality characteristic is less than 1.00, the lot payment is based on
the lowest single pay factor for any Category I or II quality characteristic.
(4) When all quality characteristics for a lot are Category II, the lot pay factor is based on the
lowest single pay factor for any Category II quality characteristic. The maximum obtainable pay
factor is 1.00.
(5) Adjusted payment for material in a lot will be made at a price determined by multiplying the
contract unit bid price by the lot pay factor as determined above, or as described in the Payment
Subsection of the Section ordering the work.
106.06 Inspection at the Plant. Work may be inspected at the point of production or fabrication.
Manufacturing plants may be inspected for compliance with specified manufacturing methods. Material
samples may be obtained for laboratory testing for compliance with quality requirements. Allow full entry
at all times to the parts of the plant producing the work.
106.07 Partial and Final Acceptance. Maintain the work during construction and until the project is
accepted. Repair damage caused by the Contractor before final acceptance of the entire project at no cost
to the Government. See FAR Clause 52.236-11 Use and Possession Prior to Completion.
(a) Partial acceptance. When a segment of the project is completed, a final inspection of that segment
may be requested. If the segment is complete and in compliance, it may be accepted. If accepted, the
CO may relieve the Contractor of further responsibility for maintaining accepted work.
When public traffic is accommodated through construction and begins using sections of roadway as
they are completed, continue maintenance of such sections until final acceptance.

34

Section 106

(b) Final acceptance. Notify the CO when the entire project is complete to schedule an inspection. If
work is determined to be complete, the inspection will constitute the final inspection. The Contractor
will be notified in writing of final acceptance as of the date of the final inspection. Final acceptance
relieves the Contractor of further responsibility for the maintenance of the project.
If the inspection discloses unsatisfactory work, the CO will provide to the Contractor a list of the work
that is incomplete or requires correction. Immediately complete or correct the work. Submit notification
when the work has been completed as provided above.

Subcontracting, FAR Clause 52.222-11 Subcontracts (Labor Standards), and FAR Clause
52.236-1 Performance of Work by the Contractor.
Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor of liability and responsibility under the contract and does
not create any contractual relation between subcontractors and the Government. The Contractor is liable
and responsible for actions or lack of action of subcontractors.
Within 14 days of subcontract award, submit an SF 1413, Statement and Acknowledgment with Part I
completed. Complete other forms that may be provided by the Government to show the work
subcontracted and the total dollar amount of the subcontract. For subcontracts involving on-site labor,

subcontracts to date as a percentage of the original contract amount. Submit this information on
subcontracts at lower tiers.
In FAR Clause 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR Clause 52.232-27 Prompt
Payment for Construction Contracts, the term "subcontracts" includes on-site and off-site work and supply
contracts.
For contracts in which FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting applies, the percentage of
work performed by the Contractor will be computed as the cost of the contract work performed by the
Contractor’s employees, not including the cost of material, divided by the cost of all contract work, not
including the cost of material. For contracts on which FAR Clause 52.236-1 Performance of Work applies,
the percentage of work performed by the Contractor will be computed as the cost of the contract work
performed on-site by the Contractor’s employees divided by the total cost of the contract.
108.03 Determination and Extension of Contract Time. Follow the requirements of FAR Clause
52.211-10 Commencement, Prosecution, and Completion of Work.
(a) Definitions.
(1) Time Impact Analysis. The procedure by which the Contractor demonstrates the effect of
specific time impacts on the overall construction schedule. Time impacts may result in an
increase or decrease in contract time.
(2) Float. The amount of time between when an activity "can start" (the early start) and when an
activity "must start" (the late start).
(b) Time Impact Analysis. Comply with the applicable contract clauses when requesting a time
extension. Notify the CO in writing within 7 days after identifying a time impact.
41

Section 108

time impact event for which notice has been given. Include the following:
(1) A title page or header block with:
(a) Contract number;
(b) Project number and name;
(c) Contractor name;
(d) Current fixed completion date;
(e) Date of submittal; and
(f) Consecutive number for each analysis.
(2) State the impact that requires a Time Impact Analysis:
(a) CO proposed or directed Contract Modification;
(b) Contractor proposed Contract Modification;
(c) Weather delay; or
(d) Other Government caused delay.
(3) A copy of the most current approved schedule existing before the impact.
(4) A detailed narrative describing each impact event. Describe impacts to each affected activity
in the construction schedule. Include the following:
(a) Contract clauses under which the request is being made;
(b) Cause of the impact;
(c) Start date of the impact;
(d) Duration of the impact; and
(e) Methods to be employed to re-sequence or reschedule the work to mitigate the impact.
Discuss the feasibility of re-sequencing future work to mitigate delay. Re-sequencing or
rescheduling of work will be at no cost to the Government. Include corresponding rationale
and assumptions of measures which increase the cost of mitigating the impact.
(5) A revised construction schedule to show the impact of the activities identified, including
re-sequencing which would mitigate the delay.
(c) Time extensions. Only delays or modifications that affect critical activities or cause noncritical
activities to become critical will be considered for time extensions.
When a Critical Path Method schedule is used, no time extension will be made for delays or
modifications that use available float as shown in the most current approved schedule existing before
the impact.
No time extension will be made for a claim that states insufficient time was provided in the contract.
(d) Execution of the Time Impact Analysis. Incorporate accepted logic changes or time extensions
into the baseline schedule by the next monthly submittal.

determine end areas. Do not measure work outside of the lines or slopes established by the
CO;
(b) If a portion of the work is acceptable, but is not completed to the established lines and
slopes; retake cross-sections or comparable measurements of that portion of the work. Use
the remeasurements to calculate new end areas; and
(c) Compute the quantity using the average end areas multiplied by the horizontal distance
along a centerline or reference line between the end areas. Deduct quantities outside the
designed or staked limits.
(2) Cubic yard (Cubic meter) in the hauling vehicle. Measure the cubic yard (cubic meter)
volume in the hauling vehicle using three-dimensional measurements at the point of delivery.
Use vehicles bearing a legible identification mark with the body shaped so the actual contents
may be readily and accurately determined. Before use, mutually agree in writing on the volume
of material to be hauled by each vehicle. Vehicles carrying less than the agreed volume may be
rejected or accepted at the reduced volume.

46

Section 109

Level selected loads. If leveling reveals the vehicle was hauling less than the approved volume,
reduce the quantity of all material received since the last leveled load by the same ratio as the
current leveled load volume is to the agreed volume. Payment will not be made for material in
excess of the agreed volume.
Material measured in the hauling vehicle may be weighed and converted to cubic yards (cubic
meters) for payment purposes if the conversion factors are mutually agreed to in writing.
(3) Cubic yard (Cubic meter) in the structure. Measure according to the lines of the structure
as shown in the plans, except as altered by the CO to fit field conditions. Make no deduction for

the volume to 60 °F (15 °C) using recognized standard correction factors.
(g) Hour. 60 minutes. Measure the actual number of hours ordered by the CO and performed by the
Contractor. Round portions of an hour up to the next half hour. Measure time in excess of 40 hours per
week at the same rate as the first 40 hours.
(h) Linear foot (Meter). As applicable, measure the work along its length from end-to-end; parallel to
the base or foundation; along the top; along the front face; or along the invert. Do not measure
overlaps.
(i) Lump sum. Do not measure directly. The bid amount is complete payment for all work described
in the contract and necessary to complete the work for that pay item. The quantity is designated as
"All". Estimated quantities of lump sum work shown in the contract are approximate.
(j) M-gallon. 1,000 gallons. Measure according to Subsection 109.02(f).
(k) Mile (Kilometer). 5,280 linear feet (1000 meters). Measure horizontally along the centerline of

slope-stake information on the reference stakes.
Establish slope stakes in the field as the actual point of intersection of the design roadway slope
with the natural ground-line when theoretical catch point information is not available.
(e) Clearing and grubbing limits. Set clearing and grubbing limits on both sides of centerline based
on the actual slope-stake locations.
(f) Grade-finishing stakes.
(1) AMG method. Construct a 1000-foot (300-meter) long test section using AMG on the
project at an approved location before beginning grading operations. Select a test location with
superelevation and curve widening transitions if applicable. Notify the CO 10 days before
beginning the test section. Demonstrate the capability, knowledge, equipment, and experience to
achieve work within tolerances. Allow 14 days to evaluate the test section. Do not start full
grading operations until the test section is approved.
Verify the grade elevation and horizontal alignment of roadway grade-finishing operations. Use
conventional survey methods at random locations specified by the CO, not to exceed 500-foot
(150-meter) intervals. Submit 3D coordinates of grade-finishing quality control checks.
(2) Conventional survey methods. Set grade-finishing stakes for grade elevations and
horizontal alignment, on centerline and on each shoulder at design roadway cross-section
locations. Set stakes at the top of subgrade and the top of each aggregate course. Reset grade
finishing stakes as many times as necessary to construct the subgrade and each aggregate course.
During turnout or pullout construction, set stakes on the centerline, on each normal shoulder, and
on the shoulder of the turnout. In parking areas, set stakes at the center and along the edges of the
parking area. Set stakes in ditches to be paved.
When the centerline curve radius is less than or equal to 250 feet (75 meters), use a maximum
longitudinal spacing between stakes of 25 feet (8 meters). When the centerline curve radius is
greater than 250 feet (75 meters), use a maximum longitudinal spacing between stakes of 50 feet
(15 meters). Use a maximum transverse spacing between stakes of 20 feet (6 meters). Use
brushes or guard stakes at each stake.
(g) Culverts. Verify and set culvert locations at the inlet, outlet, and inlet basin points according to
the plans. Perform the following if culvert design does not fit field conditions:
(1) Survey and record the ground profile along the culvert centerline;
(2) Determine the slope catch points at the inlet and outlet;
(3) Set reference points and record information necessary to determine culvert length and end
treatments;

62

Section 152

(4) Plot to scale the profile along the culvert centerline. Show the natural ground, the flow line,
the roadway section, and the culvert including end treatments and other appurtenances. Show
elevations, grade, culvert length, and degree of elbow.
(a) For single skewed culverts, submit a plotted field-design cross-section normal to roadway
centerline and at each end section. Plot the offset and elevation of natural ground at the end
section and at proposed template break points between centerline and the end section. Ensure
the template design embankment slope is not exceeded;
(b) For multiple skewed culverts, submit a plotted field design cross-section normal to
roadway centerline and at the end sections (left and right) nearest to the shoulder. Plot the
offset and elevation of natural ground at the end section and at proposed template break
points between centerline and the end section. Ensure the template design embankment slope
is not exceeded;
(c) Submit the plotted field-design cross-section for approval of final culvert length and
alignment. Plot at a clear and readable scale;
(d) Set inlet, outlet, and reference stakes when the field design has been approved. Stake inlet
and outlet ditches to make sure the culvert and end treatments (such as drop inlets) are
functional; and
(e) Adjust slope, reference, and clearing stakes as necessary to provide for culvert inlet
treatments in cut slopes. Readjust slope, reference, and clearing stakes as necessary when
culvert inlets are moved from their plan locations. Review slope adjustments with the CO
and obtain approval.
(h) Bridges. Set adequate horizontal and vertical control and reference points for bridge substructure
and superstructure components. Establish and reference the bridge chord, bridge tangent, or control
lines as specified on the bridge plans. Also establish and reference the centerline of each pier, bent,
and abutment.
(i) Retaining walls and reinforced soil slopes. Survey and record profile measurements along the
face of the proposed wall or reinforced soil slope at 5 feet (1.5 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters) in front
of the wall or slope face. Take cross-sections every 25 feet (8 meters) along the length of the wall or
reinforced soil slope and at major breaks in terrain within the limits designated by the CO. Measure
and record points every 25 feet (8 meters) and at major breaks in terrain for each cross-section. Set
additional references and control points to perform the work.
(j) Borrow and waste sites. Perform field work necessary for initial layout and measurement of the
borrow or waste site. Establish site limits and clearing limits. Measure both original and final ground
conditions and submit cross-sections as directed by the CO.
(k) Permanent monuments and markers. Perform survey and staking work necessary to establish
permanent monuments and markers as described in Section 621 or reestablish monuments as
described in Subsection 107.02.
(l) Miscellaneous survey and staking. Survey and stake other work (such as guardrail, curb and
gutter, turf establishment, utilities, and excavation limits for structures) to the proper location and
required tolerances. Propose staking increments for approval by the CO when not specified.

204.10 Embankment Construction. Incorporate only suitable roadway excavation material into the
embankment. When the supply of suitable roadway excavation is exhausted, furnish unclassified borrow to
complete the embankment. Construct embankments as follows:
(a) General. At the end of each day's operations, shape to drain and compact the embankment surface
to a uniform cross-section. Eliminate ruts and low spots that could hold water.
During all stages of construction, route and distribute hauling and leveling equipment over the width
and length of each layer of material.
Compact embankment side slopes with a tamping foot roller, by walking with a dozer, or by
over-building the fill and then removing excess material to the final slope line. For slopes 1V:1¾H or
steeper, compact the slopes as embankment construction progresses.
(b) Embankment within the roadway prism. Place embankment material in horizontal layers not
exceeding 12 inches (300 millimeters) in compacted thickness. Incorporate oversize boulders or rock
fragments into the 12-inch (300-millimeter) layers by reducing them in size or placing them

before placing the next layer.
Material composed predominately of boulders or rock fragments too large for 12-inch (300-millimeter)
layers may be placed in layers up to 24 inches (600 millimeters) thick. Incorporate oversize boulders or
rock fragments into the 24-inch (600-millimeter) layer by reducing them in size or placing individual
rock fragments and boulders greater than 24 inches (600 millimeters) in diameter as follows:
(1) Reduce rock to less than 48 inches (1200 millimeters) in the largest dimension;
(2) Distribute rock within the embankment to prevent nesting;
104

Section 204

(3) Place layers of embankment material around each rock to a depth not greater than that
permitted by Subsection 204.10(b). Fill voids between rocks; and
(4) Compact each layer according to Subsection 204.11(a) before placing the next layer.
(c) Embankment outside of roadway prism. When placing embankment outside the staked roadway
prism, place material in horizontal layers not exceeding 24 inches (600 millimeters) in compacted
thickness. Compact each layer according to Subsection 204.11.
204.11 Compaction. For compaction, use AASHTO T 27 to determine the quantity of material retained
on a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve. Compact as follows:
(a) More than 80 percent retained on a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve. Adjust the moisture content
to a level suitable for compaction. Fill the interstices around rock with earth or other fine material as
practical. Use compression-type rollers at speeds less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) per second and vibratory
rollers at speeds less than 3 feet (1 meter) per second. Compact each layer of material full width with
one of the following and until there is no visible evidence of further consolidation:
(1) Four roller passes of a vibratory roller having a minimum dynamic force of 40,000 pounds
(180 kilonewtons) impact per vibration and a minimum frequency of 1000 vibrations per minute;
(2) Eight roller passes of a 20-ton (20-metric ton) compression-type roller; or
(3) Eight roller passes of a vibratory roller having a minimum dynamic force of 30,000 pounds
(130 kilonewtons) impact per vibration and a minimum frequency of 1000 vibrations per minute.
Increase the compactive effort for layers deeper than 12 inches (300 millimeters) as follows:
• For each additional 6 inches (150 millimeters) or fraction thereof, increase the number of
roller passes in Subsection 204.11(a)(1), by four passes; or
• For each additional 6 inches (150 millimeters) or fraction thereof, increase the number of
roller passes in Subsection 204.11(a)(2) and (3), by eight passes.
(b) 50 to 80 percent retained on a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve. Classify the material according to
AASHTO M 145. Adjust the moisture content of material classified A-1 through A-5 to a moisture
content suitable for compaction. Adjust the moisture content of material classified A-6 and A-7 to
within 2 percent of the optimum moisture content. Use AASHTO T 99 to determine the optimum
moisture content of the portion of the material passing a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve. Multiply this
number by the percentage of material passing a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve, and add 2 percent to
determine the optimum moisture content of the material.
Use nonvibratory rollers at speeds less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) per second and vibratory rollers at
speeds less than 3 feet(1 meter) per second. Compact each layer of material full width according to
Subsection 204.11(a).
(c) Less than 50 percent retained on a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve. Classify the material according
to AASHTO M 145. For material classified A-1 or A-2-4, determine the maximum density according
to AASHTO T 180, Method D. For other material classifications, determine the optimum moisture
content and maximum density according to AASHTO T 99, Method C.

105

Section 204

Adjust the moisture content of material classified A-1 through A-5 to a moisture content suitable for
compaction. Adjust the moisture content of material classified A-6 and A-7 to within 2 percent of the
optimum moisture content.
Use compression-type or vibratory rollers. Compact each layer of material full width to at least
95 percent of the maximum density. Determine the in-place density and moisture content according to
AASHTO T 310 or other approved test procedures. When required, use AASHTO T 224 to correct for
coarse particles.
204.12 Ditches. Slope, grade, and shape ditches. Remove projecting roots, stumps, rock, or similar matter.
Maintain ditches in an open condition and without sticks, and other debris.
Form furrow ditches by plowing or using other acceptable methods to produce a continuous furrow. Place
excavated material on the downhill side so the bottom of the ditch is approximately 18 inches
(450 millimeters) below the crest of the loose material. Clean the ditch using a hand shovel or other
suitable method. Shape to provide drainage without overflow.
204.13 Sloping, Shaping, and Finishing. Complete slopes, ditches, culverts, riprap, and other
underground minor structures before placing aggregate courses. Slope, shape, and finish as follows:
(a) Sloping. Leave earth slopes with uniform roughened surfaces, except as described in Subsection
204.13(b), with no noticeable break as viewed from the road. Except in solid rock, round tops and
bottoms of slopes including the slopes of drainage ditches. Round material overlaying solid rock to the
extent practical. Scale rock slopes.
If a slide or slipout occurs on a cut or embankment slope, remove or replace the material and repair or
restore damage to the work. Bench or key the slope to stabilize the slide. Reshape the cut or
embankment slope to an acceptable condition.
(b) Stepped slopes. Where required, construct steps on slopes of 1⅓V:1H to 1V:2H. Construct the
steps approximately 18 inches (450 millimeters) high. Blend the steps into natural ground at the end of
the cut. If the slope contains non-rippable rock outcrops, blend steps into the rock. Remove loose
material found in transitional area. Except for removing large rocks that may fall, scaling stepped
slopes is not required.
(c) Shaping. Shape the subgrade to a smooth surface and to the cross-section required. Shape slopes to
gradually transition into slope adjustments without noticeable breaks. At the ends of cuts and at
intersections of cuts and embankments, adjust slopes in the horizontal and vertical planes to blend into
each other or into the natural ground.
(d) Finishing. Remove material larger than 6 inches (150 millimeters) from the top 6 inches
(150 millimeters) of the roadbed. Remove unsuitable material from the roadbed, and replace it with
suitable material. Finish roadbeds that are compacted according to Subsection 204.11(b) and (c) to
within ±0.05 foot (±15 millimeters) of the staked line and grade. Finish roadbeds that are compacted
according to Subsection 204.11(a) to within ±0.10 foot (±30 millimeters) of the staked line and grade.

Section 205. — ROCK BLASTING
Description
205.01 This work consists of rock fragmentation blasting using production and controlled blasting
techniques to construct engineered rock cuts.
205.02 Definitions.
(a) Production blasting. Blasting using widely spaced blast holes that typically contain larger
explosive charges to expedite movement and fragmentation for rock removal.
(b) Controlled blasting. Blasting that includes presplit blasting and cushion blasting hole
techniques. Controlled blasting uses closely-spaced and carefully aligned blast holes that typically
contain lighter charges than production holes to produce stable, aesthetically pleasing rock faces
with minimal blast damage. Controlled blast holes are the first row of blast holes, normally located
within 24 inches (600 millimeters) of the top of the staked slope.
(1) Presplit blasting. Presplit blasting detonates closely spaced backslope holes before drilling
for production blasting or before detonating the production blasting holes to produce a highly
controlled, smooth cut face.
(2) Cushion blasting. Cushion blasting is similar to presplitting, except that the detonation of the
cushion holes along the backslope is detonated immediately after the detonation of the
production and buffer holes, generally resulting in a more natural cut face appearance.
Construction Requirements
205.03 Regulations. Comply with Federal, state, and local regulations for the purchase, transportation,
storage, and use of explosive material. Federal regulations include the following:
(a) Safety and health. OSHA, 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart U.

(10) Post-blast rockfall containment designs and procedures.
205.06 Pre-Blast Condition Survey and Vibration Monitoring and Control. The Contractor is
responsible for damage resulting from blast related ground vibrations and air-blast over-pressures.
Determine the need for vibration monitoring depending on soil and rock conditions, blasting parameters as
outlined in the blasting plan, and proximity of buildings, structures, utilities, and sensitive natural features
that may be subject to damage from ground vibrations or air-blasts. If vibration monitoring is required
conform to the following requirements:
116

Section 205

(a) If not specified in the contract, establish referenceable blasting criteria for buildings, structures,
utilities and natural features that conform to federal, state, or local regulations. Present blasting criteria
in terms of distance of the facility or feature from blasting, maximum allowable peak particle velocity
limits versus structure type, maximum allowable peak particle velocity versus peak frequency, and air
over-pressure structure damage limits.
(b) Conduct a pre-blast condition survey of nearby buildings, structures, utilities, and natural features
potentially damaged by blasting-related ground vibrations or air-blast. Document the natural frequency
of each affected structure or feature. Use a survey method acceptable to the Contractor’s insurance
company. Submit a copy of pre-blast condition survey records with the site-specific blasting plans for
CO review.
(c) Control ground vibrations and air-blast over-pressures with properly designed delay sequences and
maximum allowable charge weights per delay. Verify allowable charge weights per delay by
conducting representative trial blasts and measuring ground vibrations and air-blast over-pressure
levels. Conduct test blasts with blast plan modifications that limit ground vibrations and air-blast
over-pressures to levels that will not cause damage to nearby buildings, structures, utilities and natural
features as determined by the vibration specialist.
(d) When ground vibration or air-blast damage is possible, monitor each blast with digital recording
seismographs and air-blast monitoring equipment calibrated within the last year and approved by the
CO. Locate monitoring equipment as directed by the vibration specialist. Place at least three recording
stations between the blast area and closest susceptible structures, utilities, or natural features. Place at
least one station on the structure. For ground vibration monitoring, use seismographs capable of
recording particle velocity, displacement and acceleration for three mutually perpendicular
components of vibration. Use a seismograph with a lower linear response limit over the response
frequency range of not more than 2 hertz and upper limit not less than 50 hertz. Use sensors having
lower thresholds not higher than 0.005 inches (0.13 millimeters), 0.05 inches (1.3 millimeters) per
second, and 0.02g. Use seismographs capable of producing a permanent digital time history file for
each ground motion episode.
Ensure blasting operations incorporate collected data and findings from vibration monitoring by having the
vibration specialist interpret seismograph and air-blast records.
205.07 Test Blasting. Before beginning full-scale drilling and blasting, demonstrate adequacy of the
site-specific blasting plan by drilling, blasting, and excavating a test blast of up to 100 cubic yards
(75 cubic meters) with proposed containment measures in-place. Conduct the test at an approved
location within the planned excavation area.
A test blast is unacceptable when it results in oversized fragmentation, excessive or uncontrolled
flyrock, potentially damaging ground vibrations or air-blasts, unplanned overbreak, excessive damage to
the final rock face, or unwanted overhangs. When a test blast is unacceptable, revise the site-specific
blasting plan and conduct an additional test blasts until the combination of blast hole pattern spacing,
controlled blast hole alignment, and charges produce acceptable results.
205.08 Blasting. Use explosives and initiating devices less than 1-year old. Locate explosives
magazines at sites approved by the CO.
Inspect the pre-blast area and submit the proposed extent of pre-blast clearing and scaling for approval.
117

Section 205

Use angle- or fan-drilled holes as needed during initial pioneering operations to obtain the desired face.
Controlled blasting requirements are applicable to pioneering work.
Record and maintain a log of each blast hole drilled identifying the depth, color, and character of the
cuttings, penetration rate, hole collar location and hole orientation, and other pertinent information. Before
initiating the blast, prepare a blast plan map and submit it showing designated hole numbers along with
individual hole logs completed, dated and signed by the driller.
Ensure blast holes are free of obstructions for the entire depth before placing charges. Take necessary
precautions when placing charges so, caving of material from the walls of the holes and the hole collar will
not occur.
Mitigate uncontrolled gas pressure loss during blasting and excessive blast noise by stemming the upper
portion of blast holes with appropriate dry granular material passing the ½-inch (12.5-millimeter) sieve.
Do not stem holes with drill cuttings.
Blast according to the approved site-specific blasting plan. Use blasting mats, rockfall containment
systems, and other protective devices to prevent damage to surrounding features.
Stop drilling and blasting operations, and submit a revised site-specific blasting plan according to
Subsection 205.05(b), when the following occur:
•

Slopes are unstable;

•

Slopes exceed overbreak tolerances;

•

Unwanted overhangs, ridges, or ledges are created;

•

Excessive blast damage occurs;

•

Poor fragmentation results in oversize material requiring secondary blasting and rehandling;

•

Safety of the public is jeopardized;

•

Property or natural features are endangered;

•

Excessive or uncontrolled flyrock is generated;

•

Excessive ground vibration or air-blast over-pressures occurs where damage to buildings,
structures, utilities or natural features is possible; or

•

Desired slope or rock face conditions are not produced.

Remove or stabilize cut face rock that is loose, hanging, or potentially dangerous after each blast. Scale
by methods approved by the CO. Leave minor irregularities or surface variations in place if they do not
create a hazard. Excavate and remove material outside of the planned neat line slopes which is unstable
and constitutes a potential hazard. Do not drill the next lift until slope stabilization and blast cleanup
work is complete.
(a) Production blasting. When conducting cushion blasting or presplitting, drill a lighter-loaded
buffer row of production holes on a parallel plane adjacent to the controlled blast line to minimize
blast damage to the final slope.

118

Section 205

Drill production blast holes a maximum of 4 inches (100 millimeters) in diameter to a sufficient
depth such that unbroken rock does not extend above the finish surface. Drill production blast holes
to the design depth. If more than 5 percent of the production blast holes in a lift do not conform to
the design depth requirements, redrill the shallow holes to the proper. Except when subdrilling, do
not drill production blast holes, below the base plane of the controlled blast holes.
Drill production blast holes within two drill hole diameters of the planned collar location. If more
than 5 percent of the drill hole collars in a lift are out of tolerance, fill each hole outside of the
location tolerance with crushed stone and redrill at the proper.
Detonate production holes in a controlled delay sequence.
(b) Controlled blasting. Use angled or fan drilled holes for pioneering the tops of rock cuts and
preparing working platforms. Use equipment or methods approved by the CO for areas not accessible
to track drill equipment.
Before drilling, completely remove overburden, soil, and loose or decomposed rock along the top of
the excavation for a distance of at least 30 feet (9 meters) beyond the end of the production hole
drilling limits, or to the end of the cut.
Use controlled blasting to form the final cut face on rock cuts where the staked slope ratio is
1⅓V:1H or steeper and the slope height is more than 10 feet (3 meters) above the ditch grade.
Use drilling equipment that accurately controls the angle the drill as it enters the rock. Select a lift
height and conduct drilling operations so the blast hole spacing and down-hole alignment does not
vary more than 8 inches (200 millimeters) from the proposed spacing and alignment. If more than
5 percent of the holes exceed the variance, reduce the lift height and modify drilling operations until
the holes are within tolerance.
Drill holes a maximum of 3 inches (75 millimeters) in diameter and within 3 inches (75 millimeters)
of the staked collar location. Fill and redrill blast holes outside of the location tolerance when more
than 5 percent of the hole collars in a lift are outside of the location tolerance Use crushed stone to
fill the blast holes before redrilling. Drill the controlled blast hole line at least 30 feet (9 meters)
beyond loaded production holes or to the end of the cut.
Do not exceed 30 feet (9 meters) for bench height or drill hole length. Limit subdrilling of holes to
one-half of the hole spacing or 24 inches (600 millimeters) whichever is deeper.
Offset lifts up to 24 inches (600 millimeters) horizontally to allow for drill equipment clearance.
Remove benches resulting from the drilling offset.
Compensate for drift that may occur in the upper lifts. Adjust the drill inclination angle or the initial
drill collar location to obtain the required typical section. Limit drilling to one-half of the hole spacing
or 24 inches (600 millimeters) whichever is deeper.
Do not use bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil for controlled blasting. Only standard explosives
manufactured specifically for controlled blasting will be used in controlled blast holes, unless
approved by the CO.

119

Section 205

Maximum diameter of explosives used in controlled blast holes will be no greater than one-half the
diameter of the presplit hole.
(1) Presplitting. Do not presplit final slopes and rock faces. When presplitting is allowed in the
plans, either presplit along the slope face before drilling for production blasting or presplit the
slope face in conjunction with production blasting.
(2) Cushion blasting. Perform cushion blasting to produce rough, natural looking rock slopes. Use
the existing geologic structure to create rock surfaces, terraces, and ridges that blend with adjacent
undisturbed rock faces. Preserve existing rock outcrops to the extent practical to vary the cut face
slope, composition, color, and texture.
(3) Horizontal blasting. With CO approval only, use horizontal drill holes instead of or in
conjunction with vertical cushion blasting drill holes to produce natural looking rock slopes,
mitigate drill hole traces, assist pioneering access for drill bench excavation, or to excavate sliver
rock cuts where vertical drilling is not feasible.
When required, preserve or create soil pockets and ledges for revegetation. Locate, size, and shape
these features to replicate the vegetated areas on the undisturbed rock faces. Incorporate these
features into the site-specific blasting plans. Do not create features by overshooting or selectively
removing damaged rock.
205.09 Reporting.
(a) Post-blast. Prepare an post-blast report for blasts. Submit the report within 3 days following a blast
and before drilling for the next blast. Include the following:
(1) Results of the blast (overbreak, blast damage, noise levels, flyrock, drill trace retention,
fragmentation, material containment, material rehandling requirements, and misfires);
Submit proposed changes for future site-specific blasting plans that will produce acceptable results
if blasting objectives were not met. Submit proposed repairs or stabilization plans for unstable or
blast damaged backslopes;
(2) A detailed blasting plan amended to show significant changes in pattern, loading, or timing;
(3) Drilling logs for each hole completed (dated and signed by the driller) that identify the depth,

(a) Dry method. Uniformly apply the stabilizers using a metered spreader approved by the CO. A
motor grader is not an approved spreader. Apply water using approved methods to obtain the proper
moisture content for mixing and compaction. If quicklime and fly ash are pre-blended, limit the
maximum particle size of the quicklime to ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) to avoid segregation.
(b) Slurry method. Mix material with water. Report the percent solids in the slurry to the CO for each
production day. Apply the slurry using either trucks with approved distributors or rotary mixers. Equip
the distributor truck or rotary mixer tank with an agitator to keep the stabilizers suspended in water.
Make successive passes over the material to obtain the proper moisture and additive content.

144

Section 213

213.07 Mixing. Keep traffic, except mixing equipment off the spread material. Use a rotary mixer.
(a) Lime mixtures.
(1) Preliminary mixing. Adjust the moisture content of the mixture to optimum plus necessary
hydration moisture. Use the mix design hydration moisture rate. Thoroughly mix the lime, soil,
and water to obtain a homogeneous friable mixture. Complete the mixing on the same day lime
is applied. Check to ensure lime is fully hydrated and add additional water if necessary.
Mellow the mixture for 1 to 4 days at a moisture content of 2 to 3 percent above optimum as
directed by the CO.
(2) Final mixing. Remix until 95 percent of the mixture, except hard and durable particles,
passes a 1½-inch (37.5-millimeter) sieve and at least 50 percent of the soil portion of the mixture
passes a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve when tested according to AASHTO T 27 in the non-dried
condition.
(b) Lime/fly ash mixtures. Mix according to Subsection 213.07(a)(1). Use either a pre-blended
lime/fly ash mixture or mix the lime and fly ash in separate operations.
If the lime and fly ash are mixed separately, mix the lime first and mix the fly ash within 2 days of
lime mixing. Adjust the moisture content of the lime/fly ash mixture to 2 to 3 percent above
optimum. Mix the material to prevent formation of fly ash balls. Complete the mixing within 2 hours
after adding the fly ash.
(c) Cement, fly ash, or cement/fly ash mixtures. Add water to adjust the moisture content of the
mixture to 2 to 3 percent above optimum. Mix the material until 95 percent of the soil portion of the
mixture hard and durable particles passes a 1½-inch (37.5-millimeter) sieve and at least 50 percent
of the soil portion of the mixture passes a No. 4 (4.75-millimeter) sieve when tested according to
AASHTO T 27 in the non-dried condition. Complete the mixing within 2 hours after the cement, fly
ash, or both are added.
213.08 Compacting and Finishing. Immediately after final mixing, spread and compact the mixture. Use
a vibratory sheep-foot roller to achieve compaction. Use pneumatic-tire and smooth-drum rollers for finish
rolling.
Compact the mixture to at least 95 percent of maximum dry density from the approved mix design.
Complete compaction operations within 2 hours of completion of mixing.
Finish the compacted subgrade to within plus or minus 0.10 foot (30 millimeters) of the staked line, grade,
and cross-section. Check the surface with a 10-foot (3-meter) straightedge.
Add or remove material to correct surface deviations in excess of ¾ inches in 10 feet (19 millimeters in
3 meters) between two contacts of the straightedge with the surface. When adding material, scarify the
subgrade to at least 6 inches (150 millimeters). Recompact the area to restore the required density and
strength. For Subsection 213.07(b) or (c) mixtures, complete compaction operations within 2 hours of
adding the cement, fly ash, or both.

145

Section 213

213.09 Curing. Keep the subgrade continuously moist and within 3 percent of optimum moisture content
until the next course is placed. Apply water under pressure through a spray bar equipped with nozzles,
which produce a fine, uniform spray. Place the next course within 14 days after compacting and finishing.
If the subgrade deforms, loses density, or ravels before placement of the next course; correct the damaged
subgrade.
Traffic may be allowed on the stabilized subgrade 24 hours after compaction and finishing if approved by
the CO.

drawings. Cover joints on the backside of the panels with a 12-inch (300-millimeter) wide strip of
geotextile filter. Overlap geotextile filter splices at least 4 inches (100 millimeters).
Hold the panels in position with temporary wedges or bracing during backfilling operations.
(b) Wire-faced. Place backing mats in successive horizontal lifts as backfill placement proceeds.
Connect, tighten, and anchor soil reinforcement elements to the wall facing units before placing
backfill. Do not place reinforcing elements below the corresponding connection elevations. Pull and
anchor the reinforcement mesh taut before placing additional backfill. Do not use hardware cloth or
geosynthetic material to retain backfill at the face of the wall.
(c) Gabion-faced. Place the first lift of backfill before filling the gabion baskets. Construct gabion
structures according to Section 253. Lay reinforcement mesh horizontally on compacted fill and
normal to the face of the wall. Connect the gabion facing unit to reinforcement mesh with spiral
binders or tie wire at 4-inch (100-millimeter) nominal spacing with alternating single and double
locked loops. Pull and anchor the reinforcement mesh taut before placing additional backfill.
(d) Concrete masonry block-faced. Place the first course of modular block wall units on top of and
in full contact with the leveling pad. Place units side by side for the full length of the wall such that
adjoining blocks are located according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Place units to ensure
only the front face of the unit is visible. Check for proper elevation and alignment every two courses.
Install connection devices, alignment devices, or both as required by design. Fill voids in and around
units with unit fill as required by manufacturer’s installation guidelines to meet the required
connection strength. Place geotextile filter between unit fill and select granular backfill. If the unit
fill is required to meet connection strength specifications, completely fill each course of block before
proceeding to the next course. Place reinforcement no more than two times the block depth or
24 inches (600 millimeters), whichever is less. Remove excess material from the top of the units
before installing each succeeding block course.

Section 255

255.05 Backfilling. Backfill the stabilized volume with select granular backfill according to Subsection
209.09. Place select granular backfill material from the back of the wall face to the end of the
reinforcement. Ensure that no voids exist below the reinforcement. Compact each layer according to
Subsection 209.10, except use an acceptable lightweight mechanical or vibratory compactor within
36 inches (900 millimeters) of the wall face. Consolidate facing backfill by rodding or other approved
means to produce a uniform, tight facing fill. Where the stabilized volume supports spread footings for
bridges or other structural loads, compact the top 5 feet (1.5 meters) to at least 100 percent of the
maximum density.
Do not damage or disturb the facing or reinforcing elements. Do not operate equipment directly on top
of the reinforcing mesh or strips. Correct damaged, misaligned, or distorted wall elements.
Backfill and compact behind the stabilized volume with unclassified borrow according to Subsections
209.09 and 209.10. At the end of the day's operation, slope the last lift of backfill away from the wall
face to direct surface runoff away from the wall. Do not allow surface runoff from adjacent areas to
enter the wall construction area.

(l) Additional material needed to achieve required bond capacities such as grout socks;
(m) Methods to ensure borehole stability during excavation and grout placement;
(n) Ground anchor testing methods and equipment including type and capacity of reaction load system,
drawings, supporting calculations for structural components of the ground anchor load test apparatus,
and calculations for soil bearing and settlement below the reaction frame; and
(o) Identification number and calibration test certification for each jack, pressure gauge, and electronic
load cell. Clearly indicate the serial number of each component of the testing assembly on calibration
graphs. Submit results from calibration tests conducted by an independent testing laboratory within the
previous 60 days.
Allow 10 days for submittal review.
256.05 Tendon Fabrication.
(a) General. Size tendons to ensure:
(1) The design load does not exceed 60 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the
tendon; and
(2) The maximum test load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength
of the tendon.
(b) Bond length. Determine the bond length necessary to develop the design load shown in the
drawings. Use a minimum bond length of 10 feet (3 meters) in rock and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in soil.
Provide corrosion protection of the tendon bond length with a cement grout cover.
Where encapsulation of the tendon is required, protect the tendon bond length from corrosion by
encapsulating it in a grout-filled corrugated plastic or deformed steel tube or by coating it with
fusion-bonded epoxy. Place the grout inside the tube either before or after the tendon is placed in the
drill hole. Centralize the tendon within the tube with a minimum ⅛-inch (3-millimeter) grout cover.
(c) Centralizers. Use spacers along the tendon bond length of a multi-element tendon to separate each
of the individual elements of the tendon. Use centralizers to ensure at least ½ inch (13 millimeters) of
grout cover over the tendon bond length or tendon bond length encapsulation as appropriate. Use
centralizers that do not impede the free flow of grout up the bore hole. Position centralizers within
5 feet (1.5 meters) from the top of the tendon bond length, within 12 inches (300 millimeters) from the
bottom of the tendon bond length, and so their center-to-center spacing does not exceed 10 feet
(3 meters).
Centralizers are not required on hollow-stem-augured tendons if the ground anchor is grouted through
the auger and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout during extraction of the auger. A grout is
considered "stiff" if its slump is less than 9 inches (230 millimeters).

169

Section 256

(d) Unbonded length. Provide minimum unbonded length of 10 feet (3 meters) for steel bars and
15 feet (4.5 meters) for steel strands.
(1) If the entire drill hole is grouted in one operation, provide corrosion protection of the
unbonded length with a sheath completely filled with corrosion-inhibiting grease,
corrosion-inhibiting grout, or a heat-shrinkable tube internally coated with an elastic adhesive.
If grease is used under the sheath, completely coat the unbonded tendon length, fill spaces
between individual elements of multi-element tendon with grease, and provide measures to
prevent grease from escaping at the ends of the sheath.
If the sheath is grout filled, provide a separate bond-breaker along the unbonded length of the
tendon.
(2) If a grease-filled sheath corrosion protection is provided and the drill hole above the bond
length is grouted after the ground anchor is locked off, grout the tendon inside a second sheath.
Where restressable ground anchors are used, provide restressable anchorage compatible with the
post-tensioning system provided.
If multi-element tendons are used, properly seat the wedges as recommended by the manufacturer for
the post-tensioning system provided.
(e) Bearing plates. Size the bearing plates to ensure:
(1) The bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the yield strength of the steel when a load
equal to 95 percent of the minimum specified ultimate tensile strength of the tendon is applied;
and
(2) The average bearing stress of the bearing plate does not exceed that recommended in the PTI,
Guide Specification for Post-Tensioning Materials.
Weld trumpet to bearing plate. Make the inside diameter of the trumpet equal to or larger than the hole
in the bearing plate. Make the trumpet long enough to accommodate movements during stressing and
testing. For multiple or single element tendons with encapsulation over the unbounded length, make
the trumpet at least 24 inches (600 millimeters) beyond the structural fascia and soil backslope
interface to allow a transition from the unbounded length to the anchorhead without damaging
encapsulation. Fill the trumpet of restressable ground anchors with corrosion-inhibiting grease. Provide
a permanent Buna-N synthetic rubber seal or an approved equal between the trumpet and the unbonded
length corrosion protection.
Fill the trumpets of non-restressable ground anchors with grout. Provide a 12-inch (300-millimeter)
minimum tightly-fitting temporary seal between the trumpet and the unbonded length corrosion
protection.
256.06 Handling and Storing Material. Handle and store tendons in a manner to avoid damage or
corrosion. Replace tendons exhibiting abrasions, cuts, welds, weld splatter, corrosion, or pitting. Repair or
replace tendons exhibiting damage to encapsulation or sheathing. Degrease the bond length of tendons and
remove solvent residue before installation.

170

Section 256

256.07 Installation.
(a) Drilling. Drill ground anchor holes within 12 inches (300 millimeters) of the required location.
Drill the longitudinal axis of the drill hole parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tendon. Install the
ground anchor within three degrees of the required inclination from horizontal. Install the ground
anchor with a horizontal angle within three degrees of a line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the
structure. Do not extend ground anchors beyond the right-of-way or easement limits.
Insert the tendon in the drill hole to the required depth without driving or forcing. Where the tendon
cannot be completely inserted, remove the tendon, and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion.
(b) Grouting.
(1) Equipment. Use a positive displacement grout pump equipped with a pressure gage capable of
measuring pressures of at least 150 pounds per square inch (1 megapascal) or twice the required
grout pressure, whichever is greater. Provide a secondary pressure capability of at least
1,000 pounds per square inch (7 megapascal) to clean out grout or dirt blockages in hoses, tremie
tubes, or casings. Use a high speed, high shear grout mixer with a minimum operating speed of
1,500 revolutions per minute to produce a well-mixed grout that is free of lumps or other
indications of prior cement hydration. Furnish holding tanks with a variable speed high-efficiency
paddle that maintains a thoroughly mixed grout for pumping.
(2) Procedures. Grout tendons into drill holes using a neat hydraulic cement grout placed in one
continuous operation. Inject the grout from the lowest point of the drill hole. The grout may be
placed either before or after insertion of the tendon. Record the quantity of the grout and the grout
pressure for each ground anchor. Control the grout pressures to avoid excessive heaving or
fracturing.
Except as indicated below, the grout above the top of the bond length may be placed at the same
time as the bond length grout, but do not placed it under pressure. Do not place grout at the top of
the drill hole in contact with the back of the structure or the bottom of the trumpet.
If the ground anchor is installed in a fine-grained soil using drill holes larger than 6 inches
(150 millimeters) in diameter, place the grout above the top of the bond length after the ground
anchor has been tested and stressed. The entire drill hole may be grouted at one time if it can be
demonstrated that the ground anchor does not derive a significant portion of its load-carrying
capacity from the soil above the bond length.
Use pressure grouting for grout protected tendons anchored in rock. After sealing the drill hole,
pressure inject grout until a 50-pound per square inch (0.3-megapascal) grout pressure at the top of
the drill hole is maintained for 5 minutes.
(c) Finishing. After grouting is complete, fill the grout tube with grout if it will remain in the hole.
Wait at least 3 days before loading the tendon.
Extend the corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length up beyond the bottom seal of the
trumpet or 12 inches (300 millimeters) into the trumpet if no trumpet seal is provided.
Trim the corrosion protection surrounding the tendon so it does not contact the bearing plate of the
anchorhead during testing and stressing.

171

Section 256

Place the bearing plate and anchorhead so the axis of the tendon is within three degrees of
perpendicular to the bearing plate and the axis of the tendon passes through the center of the bearing
plate without bending the tendon.
If grout protected tendons or fusion-bonded epoxy encapsulations are used, electronically isolate the
bearing plate, anchorhead, and trumpet from the surrounding concrete, soldier pile, or metallic element
embedded in the structure.
Place trumpet grease during construction. Place trumpet grout after the ground anchor has been tested
and stressed.
Completely cover anchorages permanently exposed to the atmosphere with a corrosion-inhibiting
grease or grout.
Inspect the trumpet and anchorage grout levels 24 hours after initial grout placement. If needed, refill
the trumpet or anchorage with grout.
256.08 Testing and Stressing.
(a) Testing equipment. Conform to the following:
(1) Dial gauges. Use two dial gauges capable of measuring to 0.001 inch (0.025 millimeters) and
with sufficient travel to measure the theoretical elastic elongation of the total length at the
maximum test load without resetting, accounting for elongation in both the bonded and
unbonded zones. Align the gauges parallel to the axis of the anchor or pile and support the
gauges independently from the hydraulic jack, ground anchor, or reaction frame.
(2) Hydraulic jack, pressure gauge and load cell. Apply test loads with a hydraulic jack and
measure with a calibrated pressure gauge and electronic load cell. Use a hydraulic jack and
pressure gauge with a pressure range not exceeding twice the anticipated maximum test pressure
and calibrated as a unit by an independent firm within 45 days of the start of work. Use a
pressure gauge graduated in 100-pound per square inch (1-megapascal) increments or less. Use a
jack with ram travel sufficient to allow testing without resetting.
(3) Reference gauge. Have the reference gauge calibrated with the test jack and pressure gauge.
Keep the reference gauge at the project site.
(4) Reaction frame. Provide a reaction frame designed by a professional engineer to meet the
requirements of the site, resist the maximum test loads and prevent excessive deformation of the
bearing surface.
(b) Stressing. Place testing equipment over the ground anchor tendon to ensure the jack, bearing
plates, load cells, and stressing assembly are axially aligned with the tendon and the tendon is centered
within the equipment. Do not apply loads greater than 80 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile
strength of the tendon.

172

Section 256

Place the reference pressure gauge in series with the pressure gauge, jack, and load cell so they need
not be unloaded and repositioned during a test. Raise the load from one increment to another. Hold the
load just long enough to measure and record the ground anchor movement to the nearest 0.001 inch
(0.025 millimeters) with respect to an independent fixed reference point. Repump the jack as necessary
to maintain a constant load. Monitor the load with a pressure gauge. If the load measured by the
pressure gauge and the load measured by the reference pressure gauge differ by more than 10 percent,
recalibrate the jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure gauge.
(1) Performance tests. The CO will designate locations for sacrificial ground anchors for
performance tests. Test according to Tables 256-1 and 256-3.

(c) Lock off. Reduce the load to the specified lock-off load and transfer the load to the anchorage
device. After transferring the load and before removing the jack, measure the lift-off load. If the load is
not within 10 percent of the specified lock-off load, reset the anchorage and remeasure the lift-off load.
Repeat as necessary.
256.09 Test Results and Reporting. Plot the ground anchor movement versus the maximum load for each
test sequence in Tables 256-1 and 256-2, and plot the residual movement of the tendon at each alignment
load versus the highest previously applied load.
Provide preliminary results to the CO for each ground anchor tested before testing personnel leave the site.
Submit detailed verification and proof test load and deflection data in a tabular format. Submit a graph that
plots total ground anchor head movement versus load, the A-line, and the B-line. The A-line is defined as
0.8 multiplied by the theoretical free test length elastic elongation. The B-line is defined as the theoretical
free test length elastic elongation plus 0.50 multiplied by the theoretical bonded length elastic elongation.
Allow 5 days for the CO to conduct a review of the data and approve ground anchor installation.
256.10 Acceptance. See Table 256-3 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Material for ground anchors will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.03. Submit a production
certification for the ground anchor material.
Construction of ground anchors will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
Installed ground anchors will be evaluated based on one of the following performance or proof test results:
(a) After a 10-minute hold, the ground anchor carries the maximum test load with less than 0.04 inches
(1 millimeter) of movement between 1 and 10 minutes and the total movement at the maximum test
load exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the unbonded length.
(b) After a 60-minute hold, which is only conducted after 10-minute hold test fails, the ground anchor
carries the maximum test load with a movement rate that does not exceed 0.08 inch (2 millimeters) per
log cycle of time and the total movement at the maximum test load exceeds 80 percent of the
theoretical elastic elongation of the unbonded length.
Replace ground anchors with unacceptable performance or proof test results. Do not retest failed ground
anchors.

259.05 General. See Section 257 for Contractor-designed soil nail retaining walls. Verify the limits of the
wall installation.
Clear the work area of vegetation and obstructions according to Sections 201 and 203.
Excavate according to Section 204. Excavate for the wall in staged lifts concurrent with soil nail
installation and shotcrete placement. Do not allow the exposed unsupported final excavation face cut
height to exceed the vertical soil nail spacing plus the required reinforcing lap or the short-term stand-up
height of the ground, whichever is less. Do not excavate to the next lower lift until soil nail installation,
reinforced shotcrete placement, attachment of bearing plates and nuts, and soil nail testing have been
completed and accepted for the current lift. Cure grout and shotcrete at least 72 hours or attain the
specified 3-day compressive strength before excavating the next underlying lift. Application of the
shotcrete may be delayed up to 24 hours if it can be demonstrated the delay will not adversely affect the
excavation face stability.
259.06 Tendon Fabrication. Provide tendons designed to carry loads consistent with the approved design.
Thread tendon ends so they are capable of withstanding the approved test loads in addition to
accommodating the attachment of the bearing plate, beveled washer, nut, or other appurtenances as
required by the manufacturer’s specifications and the contract.

183

Section 259

Limit coupling of tendons to two per installation. Use couplers manufactured with a center stop to ensure
equal length of thread connects each section. Do not use couplers that interfere with the flow of grout.
Protect couplings from corrosion using the same corrosion protection used on the soil nail tendon
assembly. Use centralizers to position the tendon within 1 inch (25 millimeters) of the center of the drill
hole. Use centralizers that do not impede the free flow of grout into the drill hole. Position centralizers
within 24 inches (600 millimeters) from the top and bottom of the tendon and so their center-to-center
spacing does not exceed 10 feet (3 meters). Secure centralizers to the tendon to prevent shift during
handling or inserting into the drill hole.
259.07 Handling and Storing Material. See Subsection 256.06.
259.08 Installation.
(a) Drilling. Drill soil nail holes at the required locations and orientations. Use drilling equipment and
methods suitable for the ground conditions. Do not use water, drilling slurry, or other fluids for drilling
or removing cuttings.
Insert the soil nail tendon into the hole. Clean or redrill drill holes where the tendon with centralizers
cannot be completely inserted without forcing or driving.
(b) Grouting. Use a positive displacement grout pump according to Subsection 256.07(b) (1).
Grout tendons into drill holes using a neat hydraulic cement grout. Mix grout as recommended by
the cement supplier at the specified water-to-cementitious material ratio. Inject grout within
45 minutes of adding the cement to the water or within 15 minutes after mixing when the ambient
temperature is 90 °F (32 °C) or higher. Do not allow the grout temperature to exceed 90 °F (32 °C).
Grout the drill hole within 2 hours of completing drilling.
Inject the grout at the lowest point of each drill hole. Place primary and secondary grout stages in one
continuous operations. Keep the outlet end of the grout tube below the surface of the grout as the tube
is withdrawn to prevent voids. Control grout pressures to avoid ground heaving or fracturing. Record
the quantity of injected grout and the grout pressure for each soil nail installation. After grouting is
complete, fill the grout tube with grout if it will remain in the hole.
Maintain the temporary unbonded length of proof test soil nails open for later grouting. If the
unbonded test length of production proof test soil nails cannot be satisfactorily grouted after testing,
install a new soil nail in its place.
Request approval for alternate soil nail installation methods, including grout socks, grout admixtures,
or both when conditions prove necessary. Provide the CO with an on-site demonstration as part of the
request.
259.09 Testing and Stressing.
(a) Testing equipment. See Subsection 256.08(a).

184

Section 259

(b) Stressing. Place stressing equipment over the soil nail so that the jack, bearing plates, load cells,
and stressing assembly are axially aligned with the tendon and the tendon is centered within the
equipment. Do not apply loads greater than 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile
strength of the tendon for Grade 150 (1035) bars or 90 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate
tensile strength of the tendon for Grade 60 (420) or 75 bars. Do not test soil nails until the soil nail
grout and shotcrete facing have cured for at least 72 hours and attained the specified 3-day
compressive strength.
Place the reference pressure gauge in series with the pressure gauge and jack so they need not be
unloaded and repositioned during a test. Raise the load from one increment to another. Hold the load
for the required time beginning immediately after the load is applied and record the soil nail head
movement to the nearest 0.001 inch (0.025 millimeters) with respect to an independent fixed reference
point. Repump the jack as necessary to maintain a constant load. Monitor the load with a pressure
gauge. If the load measured by the pressure gauge and the load measured by the reference pressure
gauge differ by more than 10 percent, recalibrate the jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure
gauge.
(1) Verification test. The CO will designate locations for sacrificial soil nails for verification tests.
Provide verification test soil nails with a minimum unbonded length of 3 feet (0.9 meters) and a
minimum bonded length of 10 feet (3 meters).
Use the following formula to determine the maximum bonded length:

260.05 Rock Bolt Fabrication.
(a) General. Fabricate rock bolts according to PTI, Recommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil
Anchors. Size tendons to ensure:
(1) The design load does not exceed 60 percent of minimum ultimate tensile strength of the tendon;
and
(2) The maximum test load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of
the tendon.

193

Section 260

(b) Couplers. Couple only fully-grouted anchors. Couple sections together only when the design
length exceeds the standard commercially available bar lengths. Use couplers with a center stop to
ensure equal length of thread connects each section. Do not use couplings that interfere with the flow
of grout.
(c) Anchorage. For the stressing anchorage, use a steel bearing plate, washers (flat hardened,
beveled or spherical, as required), and a nut capable of developing 95 percent of the minimum
ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
(d) Centralizers. For cement grouted rock bolts, place centralizers along the tendon at 8-foot
(2.5-meter) centers, with at least one centralizer per rock bolt. Locate the lowermost centralizer
within 12 inches (300 millimeters) of the end. Use centralizers of sufficient strength to support the
anchor bar in the drilled hole.
260.06 Handling and Storing Material. Handle and store tendons according to ASTM D3963, the
manufacturer’s recommendations, and Subsection 256.06.
Store polyester resin grout cartridges according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not use
polyester resin grout cartridges that are expired, damaged, frozen, hardened, or otherwise defective.
260.07 Installation.
(a) Drilling. Provide equipment capable of drilling straight and uniform-diameter holes. Do not use
water or drilling slurry. Drill rock bolt and dowel hole collars and hole depths within 6 inches
(150 millimeters) of the required location and depth. Size drill holes to provide at least 0.5 inches
(13 millimeters) of grout cover over the bond zone portion of the tendon. Clean drill holes of cuttings,
sludge, and debris.
(b) Grouting. Install the rock anchor within 24 hours of completing the drill hole. Orient
reinforcement within 5 degrees of the specified angle.
(1) Cement grout installations. Use a positive displacement grout pump according to
Subsection 256.07(b)(1).
Install the tendon and batch and inject grout according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
For single-stage cement-grouted tendons, do not grout beyond the top of the bond-breaker
assemblage along the free-stressing length before tensioning the tendon. Place the grout in one
continuous operation. Control grout pressures to avoid ground heaving or fracturing. Fill the
grout tube with grout if it will remain in the hole.
Record the quantity of injected grout and the grout pressure for each installation. Notify the CO
of grout quantity overruns including the reason for the overrun and proposed actions to minimize
future overruns. Obtain approval for alternative grouting methods.
(2) Resin grout installations. Insert the approved number and size of resin cartridges to fully
cover the bond zone and fill the drill hole to the collar. Follow the approved procedures for tendon
spin speed, travel speed, and spin time for resin used. Use spin adapters during tendon installation
to avoid damaging the finished end tendon threads.
(a) Rock bolts. Fully grout the bond zone with fast-set resin and the remainder of the hole with
slow-set resin or cement grout for combination grout installations.
194

Section 260

(b) Rock dowels. Use a single resin grout with set time sufficient for complete installation.
(c) Bearing plate installation. Place the bearing plate so at least three quarters of the plate’s surface is
in contact with a rock face. Construct a bearing pad approved by the CO if the rock face is irregular or
unsound or the axis of the tendon is greater than 20 degrees from perpendicular to the bearing plate
when the axis of the tendon passes through the center of the bearing plate without bending the tendon.
Use beveled washers if the axis of the tendon is greater than 5 degrees from perpendicular to the
bearing plate. Allow at least 4 inches (100 millimeters) of tendon length beyond the nut.
For dowels, when the grout has reached final set per the manufacturer’s recommendations or a
minimum compressive strength of 60 percent of the 7-day compressive strength; install the bearing
plate, washers and nut, and apply a torque of 100 foot-pounds (135 newton-meters) to ensure proper
seating against the rock face.
After load-testing, tension and lock-off of rock bolts, place non-structural filler (cement grout or
polyester resin grout) for the entire free stressing length. Remove excess grout from the rock face
and anchor assembly.
Paint exposed parts of the rock bolt, bearing plate, and nut with an approved corrosion-protection paint
or epoxy patching compound. When covers are required, rock bolt the anchorage cover to the bearing
plate and completely fill cover with grout after the rock anchor has been tested and finally locked-off.
After the grout has achieved initial set, demonstrate to the CO that the anchorage cover is completely
filled with grout.
For rock bolt and dowel installations, ensure the tendon is fully grouted to the collar of the hole.
260.08 Rock Bolt Testing, Stressing, and Finishing. Conduct testing of tensioned and untensioned rock
bolts according to PTI, Recommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors.
Trim the corrosion protection surrounding the free stressing length of the tendon so it does not contact the
bearing plate during testing and stressing. For single-stage cement-grouted tendons, tension the tendon
after the bond zone grout is set and reaches sufficient pull-out strength. For two-stage cement-grouted
tendons, tension the tendon after the bond zone grout is set and reaches sufficient pull-out strength and
before the free stressing length is grouted. For resin-grouted tendons, tension the tendon after the fast-set
resin fully sets in the bond zone and before the slow-set resin begins to set in the free stressing length.
For mechanically-anchored tendons, tension the tendon immediately following insertion in the hole and
before fully grouting.
(a) Performance tests. Use the same equipment, tendons, drill hole specifications, grout,
post-tensioning, and installation methods as used for production installations to verify required bond
strengths in the anchorage zone before final grouting of the stressing length. For two-stage grouted,
post-tensioned rock bolts and single-stage, grouted, post-tensioned rock bolts employing bond
breakers, conduct performance tests on sacrificial or production installations. For pre-tensioned
installations, conduct performance tests on sacrificial installations. When changes or modifications
in the equipment, tendons, drill hole specifications, or installation methods occur; conduct another
performance test as approved by the CO.

195

Section 260

Tension rock bolts to 120 percent of the design load with a calibrated hollow-ram hydraulic jack for
a holding time of not more than 60 minutes. Take load and extension measurements during
tensioning with a measuring device (such as a dial gauge or vernier scale) capable of measuring to
0.001 inches (0.025 millimeters). A rock bolt is acceptable if both of the following conditions are
satisfied:
(1) The total elastic movement obtained at the maximum test load exceeds 80 percent of the
theoretical elastic elongation of the free stressing length; and
(2) The rock bolt will carry the maximum test load with a creep rate that does not exceed
0.04 inches (1 millimeter) between 1 and 10 minutes or 0.08 inches (2.0 millimeters) per log
cycle between the 6 and 60 minute readings.
Perform at least two successful performance tests for each different rock unit, anchor type, and
proposed drilling-installation-grouting method before beginning production rock bolt installation.
When a performance test fails, modify the design or construction procedure as needed and conduct
another performance test on a replacement production installation. Conduct performance tests at
locations approved by the CO.
(b) Proof tests. Conduct proof testing on production pre- and post-tensioned rock bolt installations.
Proof test each production rock bolt to 120 percent of the design load. If no loss of load occurs in
10 minutes the rock bolt is approve. When a proof test fails or results vary significantly from the
performance test result, document the expected reasons for failure, modify the design or construction
procedure and conduct an additional performance test on a replacement production rock bolt
installation. Obtain approval from the CO for the location of replacement anchors.
After tensioning and achieving a successful rock bolt proof test, lock off the load at 100 percent of the
design load and grout the remaining portion of the rock bolt, as appropriate.
260.09 Rock Dowel Lift-Off Testing and Finishing. Conduct testing of rock dowels according to
PTI, Recommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors.
Test only fully grouted dowels. Conduct at least five successful lift-off tests in succession for each
different rock unit, anchor type, and proposed drilling-installation-grouting method. Gradually load liftoff test reinforcements to 60 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the dowel tendon and
monitor the pressure gage to verify the anchor is holding the design load for at least 10 minutes. If the
anchors do not pull out, test 5 percent of the remaining dowels. If pressure is lost on the pressure gage
due to anchorage movement, replace the dowel and conduct lift-off tests on an additional five anchors in
succession until all are satisfactory.
260.10 Test Results and Reporting. Submit test results to CO for review. Maintain daily records of
rock bolt and dowel work in a manner acceptable to the CO, including:
(a) As-built drawings depicting the location of each anchor, noting anchor designation, date drilled
and grouted, total anchor length, bonded length, free stressing length, grout mix, grout volume,
average grout pressure, hole diameter, size of tendon, tendon inclination, and installation comments.
Submit as-built drawings according to Section 104 after work completion.

196

Section 260

(b) Performance and proof test data forms, including the anchor designation, bonded length, free
stressing length, stressing length, date of stressing operation, signature of stressing operator or
inspector, required elongation and associated gage pressure, actual elongation and associated gage
pressure, identification numbers of jacking equipment, comments, and a table including incremental
jack pressure, jack load, and movement.

Submit a mix design for approval 30 days before production which includes the following:
(a) Optimum cement content conforming to the requirements of Table 305-1;
(b) Maximum density and moisture content at the optimum cement content according to
AASHTO T 134, minimum of 4 points;
(c) Source of each component material;
(d) Results of all tests and applicable charts and graphs;
(e) Gradation and proportion of imported crushed aggregate;
(f) 200-pound (90-kilogram) sample of the pavement, base, and imported crushed aggregate, if
requested; and
(g) 20-pound (9-kilogram) sample of Portland cement, if requested.
Begin production only after the mix design is approved. Submit a new mix design if the CO requests due
to a change in material.
305.04 General. See Subsection 304.03.
305.05 Production Start-Up Procedures.
(a) Preparatory phase meeting. Conduct a pre-stabilization preparatory phase meeting at least
7 days before the start of stabilizing operations according to Subsection 153.04(a).
(b) Control strip. Provide 7 days notice before beginning production.
On the first day of production, stabilize a 1000-foot (300-meter) control strip, one-lane wide, at the
designated lift thickness and mix design proportions. Construct the control strip on the project at an
approved location.
Construct the control strip using construction procedures intended for the entire project. Take
nuclear gauge density readings behind each roller pass to determine the roller pattern necessary to
achieve the specification requirements in Subsection 305.10. Cease production after construction of
the control strip until the stabilized base layer and the control strip are evaluated for acceptance.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. See Subsection 106.01
for the disposition of material in unacceptable control strips. Accepted control strips may remain in
place and will be accepted and measured as a part of the completed base. When a control strip is
accepted, full production may begin.
Use these start-up procedures when changing construction procedures, when resuming production after a
termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.04, or the beginning
of a new construction season.
305.06 Adding Crushed Aggregate. See Subsection 304.04.
305.07 Pulverizing. See Subsection 304.05.
222

Section 305

305.08 Applying Cement. Do not add cement when the underlying surface is frozen, muddy, or when
conditions allow for excessive loss to eroding or blowing. Begin cement application when the air
temperature is above 40 °F (5 °C) and is expected to stay above 40 °F (5 °C) for 48 hours. Apply cement
by one of the following methods:
(a) Dry method. Use a metered mechanical spreader to uniformly apply the cement. Use canvas (or
similar) skirts around the spreader box to minimize dust.
(b) Slurry method. Use approved equipment and dispersal processes to uniformly apply a cement and
water slurry without pooling or run off. Equip slurry tanks with an agitator to keep the cement
suspended in water. Apply the slurry to the pulverized material with 60 minutes from time water first
contacts the cement. Make successive passes over the material if necessary to obtain the proper
moisture and cement content for mixing and compacting.
305.09 Mixing. Begin mixing within 30 minutes after cement application. Use a road reclaimer
conforming to Subsection 304.05. Add water as necessary to adjust the moisture content of the mixture to
within 2 percent of optimum as indicated in the approved mix design. Continue mixing until the cement is
uniformly distributed within the in situ material creating a homogeneous full depth layer. Complete
mixing within 1 hour of the cement application.
305.10 Compacting and Finishing. Compact the processed material uniformly to at least 95 percent of
maximum density as determined from AASHTO T 134. Furnish rollers sized and configured to achieve
the required compaction and finishing. Operate rollers according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Compact the processed material full width by rolling from the sides to the center,
parallel to the centerline of the road. Along curbs, headers, walls, and places not accessible to the roller,
compact the material with approved tampers or compactors.
During compaction and final grading maintain the moisture content of the mixture to within 2 percent of
optimum. Do not leave areas of stabilized material uncompacted or undisturbed for more than
30 minutes. Complete compaction within 1 hour after mixing.
Finish the compacted surface according to Subsection 301.06 to produce a surface that is smooth, dense,
and free of compaction planes, ridges, or loose material. Clean the compacted surface of loose material,
dirt, or other deleterious material by approved methods. Complete finishing operations within 4 hours
from the start of mixing including corrections to irregularities in the surface.
305.11 Construction Joints. When cement application operations are delayed or stopped for more than
2 hours, make a transverse construction joint by cutting back into the completed work to form an
approximately vertical face. Tie new work into the completed work by remixing approximately 36 inches
(900 millimeters) of the completed course.
305.12 Curing. Cure the layer at least 1 day before placing the next course by one of the methods below:
(a) Water method. Keep the surface continuously moist by applying water through a spray bar
equipped with nozzles producing a fine, uniform spray. During the first 24 hours of curing, use a
water truck with side spray to avoid driving on the newly stabilized layer.
(b) Prime coat method. Seal the surface by placing an inverted prime coat according to
Subsection 411.06(b). Provide and maintain a continuous film over the surface.

223

Section 305

If approved by the CO, allow local automobile traffic on the cement stabilized layer 4 hours after finishing
operations are complete. Limit traffic speeds to 20 miles (30 kilometers) per hour. Stop traffic if there is
surface marring or deformation. Do not allow truck traffic (other than equipment necessary to complete the
next course) on the cement stabilized layer until the next course is placed.
305.13 Maintenance. Maintain the cement stabilized layer to the correct line, grade, and cross-section
until placement of the next course. If the cement stabilized layer loses stability, density, or finish before
placement of the next course, reprocess, recompact, and add cement as necessary to restore the strength of
the damaged material.
Overlay the stabilized base within 14 days after compacting.
305.14 Acceptance. See Table 305-2 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Crushed aggregate will be evaluated under Subsection 106.03.
Cement will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.03.

306.04 General. See Subsection 304.03.
306.05 Production Start-Up Procedures.
(a) Preparatory phase meeting. Conduct a pre-stabilization preparatory phase meeting at least
7 days before the start of stabilizing operations according to Subsection 153.04(a).
(b) Control strip. Provide 7 days notice before beginning production.
On the first day of production, stabilize a 1000-foot (300-meter) long control strip, one-lane wide,
and at the designated lift thickness. Construct the control strip on the project at an approved location.
Construct the control strip using the construction procedures intended for the entire project. Cease
production after construction of the control strip until the stabilized base layer and the control strip
are evaluated and verified for approval.

228

Section 306

After the reclaimer has pulverized and mixed one reclaimer width for 100 feet (30-meter) of the
control strip and before compaction, dig a test pit to evaluate the mixing and distribution of the
asphalt. If homogeneous mixing is not occurring, modify the process and pulverize, mix, and verify
another 100 feet (30-meter). Continue until acceptable mixing and distribution of asphalt is obtained.
Take three random loose mix samples within the control strip and verify that 100 percent passes the
2-inch (50-millimeter) sieve.
Take nuclear gauge density readings behind each roller pass according to AASHTO T 310 to
determine the roller pattern necessary to achieve at least 97 percent of the maximum wet density.
Determine the maximum wet density by sampling processed material from behind the reclaimer
(before compaction) and testing the material according to AASHTO T 180, Method D.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. See Subsection 106.01
for the disposition of material in unacceptable control strips. Accepted control strips may remain in
place and will be accepted and measured as a part of the completed base.
(c) Control strip verification. The control strip is verified when the specified density, gradation,
and moisture content is obtained. Full production may begin once control strip is verified. Provide
the CO with the reclaimer speed, emulsified or foamed asphalt application temperature, and asphalt
and water line pressures used on the verified control strip.
Use these start-up procedures when changing construction procedures, when resuming production after a
termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.04, or the beginning
of a new construction season.
306.06 Adding Crushed Aggregate. See Subsection 304.04.
306.07 Pulverizing and Mixing.
(a) When using emulsified or foamed asphalt furnish a road reclaimer that is:
(1) Self-propelled;
(2) Specifically manufactured for in-place reclamation;
(3) Capable of reducing the existing material to the required size;
(4) Equipped with at least an 8-foot (2.4-meter) cutting width;
(5) Equipped with standard automatic depth controls adjustable in increments of ½ inch
(13 millimeters);
(6) Equipped with independent asphalt application nozzles capable of being turned off
individually and verified open and working from within the operator cabin; and
(7) Equipped with an asphalt and water application control system including full width spray
bars and positive displacement pumps automatically interlocked to the machine speed.
(b) In addition to the above, when using foamed asphalt furnish a road reclaimer that is:
(1) Equipped with an exterior test nozzle to verify proper foaming action;

229

Section 306

(2) Equipped with individual expansion chambers for each nozzle where asphalt binder and
water is injected under pressure through individual orifices for atomization and foam expansion;
(3) Equipped with an internal electric heat cleaning system to self-clean foaming nozzles;
(4) Equipped with maximum nozzle spacing of 6 inches (150 millimeters); and
(5) Equipped with a compressor capable of providing at least 45 pounds per square inch
(310 kilopascals) of pressure.
Use the reclaimer to pulverize the existing roadway material in-place until 100 percent passes the 2-inch
(50-millimeter) sieve. Reprocess or remove larger particles and dispose of them according to Subsection
203.05.
306.08 Applying Cement or Fly Ash. Do not apply cement or fly ash when conditions allow for
excessive loss to blowing. Use a metered mechanical spreader to uniformly apply cement or fly ash on
the roadway surface. Use canvas (or similar) skirts around the spreader box to minimize dust.
306.09 Applying Asphalt.
(a) Requirements for emulsified and foamed asphalt. Apply emulsified or foamed asphalt when
the surface and air temperatures in the shade are at least 50 ºF (10 ºC). Do not begin applying
emulsified asphalt during periods of fog, rain, or when temperatures below 35 °F (1.7 °C) are
anticipated within 48 hours.
Automatically adjust the asphalt and water flow based the reclaimer speed and recycled material
mass for the approved mix design. Maintain the asphalt temperature within the range recommended
by the supplier.
Complete pulverizing and mixing operations in continuous one lane-width segments up to ½ mile
(0.8 kilometers) in length. Mix the pulverized roadway material with emulsified asphalt binder, other
additives, and the necessary mixing water for optimum dispersion. If two passes are used, shape and
compact the reclaimed material with a steel drum roller after the first pass to provide depth control
for the second pass of the reclaimer. Add the required quantity of emulsified or foamed asphalt
during the final pass of the reclaimer.
Verify that the emulsified or foamed asphalt is evenly dispersed and coating the pulverized material.
Dig test pits within the mix at least every ¼ mile (0.4 kilometers) and observe the distribution of the
emulsified or foamed asphalt in each pit.
(b) Additional requirements for foamed asphalt. Do not use foamed asphalt with an application
temperature below 320 °F (160 °C).
Do not apply foamed asphalt on previously treated foamed asphalt areas.
306.10 Compacting and Finishing. Compact and finish each segment before beginning mixing
operations on the next segment. Maintain the moisture content of the mixture within 2 percent of
optimum.

230

Section 306

Compact the processed material uniformly to at least 97 percent of the maximum wet density as
determined from the control strip. If material changes, reestablish the maximum wet density according
to Subsection 306.05(b). Determine the in-place density according to AASHTO T 310.
Use at least three rollers: primary, secondary, and finish rollers sized and configured to achieve the
required compaction and finish. Operate rollers according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Compact the processed material full width by rolling the material between the reclaimer wheel paths
first then from the sides to the center, parallel to the centerline of the road. Along curbs, headers, walls,
and places not accessible to the roller, compact the material with approved tampers or compactors.
Shape and grade the mixture to the correct lines, grades, and cross-section. Finish the compacted surface
according to Subsection 301.06 to produce a surface that is smooth, dense, and free of compaction
planes, ridges, or loose material. Clean the compacted surface of loose material, dirt, or other deleterious
material by approved methods. Do not leave uncompleted segments at the end of the work day.
306.11 Construction Joints.
(a) Longitudinal joints. Make longitudinal joints coincide with each change in cross-slope,
regardless of the overlap width. Provide a minimum longitudinal overlap of 6 inches
(150 millimeters).
(b) Transverse joints. After full depth reclamation operations stop, ensure continuity across
transverse joints by cutting back into the completed work for a distance recommended by the
manufacturer of the reclaimer.
306.12 Curing and Maintenance.
(a) Emulsified asphalt. Keep traffic and equipment off the stabilized base for at least 1 hour after
completing compaction. Do not allow traffic and construction equipment on the stabilized base until
it is sufficiently stable to withstand marring and permanent deformation.
(b) Foamed asphalt. Before opening the stabilized base to traffic and after completing compaction,
moisten the surface and roll with a pneumatic-tire roller to create a tight and closed surface.
Continue to keep the surface moist until placement of the next course or final surface.
If required, place a fog seal on the surface of the stabilized base after final compaction according to
Section 406.
Route hauling and other construction equipment uniformly over the full width of the recycled surface to
minimize non-uniform compaction.
Maintain the emulsified asphalt stabilized layer to the correct line, grade, and cross-section until
placement of the next course or final riding surface. If the stabilized layer loses stability, density, or finish
before placement of the next course, reprocess and recompact as necessary to restore the strength of the
damaged material.
Overlay the stabilized base material within 14 days after compacting.

Construction Requirements

309.03 General. Prepare the surface on which the emulsified asphalt-treated aggregate base course is
placed according to Section 204 or 303 as applicable.
Submit at least 14 days before incorporating the aggregate into the work:
(a) A proposed target values within the gradation ranges shown in Table 703-2 for the required
grading; and
(b) A representative 300-pound (150-kilogram) aggregate sample.
End placement and resubmit new target values if the calculated mean value for a tested sieve differs from
the target value by more than the allowable deviation for that sieve.
309.04 Mixing and Spreading. Use a stationary pugmill with weighing, volumetric, or other gauging
equipment capable of controlling the material entering the mixer. Interlock the controls for the aggregate
feed with the emulsified asphalt and water controls to ensure uniform introduction of material into the
mixer.
Determine the optimum moisture content of the mixture according to AASHTO T 180, Method D. Add
aggregate and water to the mixer; then add 2 percent emulsified asphalt by mass of aggregate. Adjust the
total liquid content (emulsified asphalt and water) to within 1 percent of the optimum moisture content at
the time of compaction. Mix until particles are uniformly coated.
Place the treated aggregate after mixing. Spread the mixture on the prepared surface in a uniform layer.
Shape the mixture to the required line, grade, and cross-section. Route hauling equipment uniformly over
the full width of the surface to minimize rutting or uneven compaction.
309.05 Compacting. Compact the mixture according to Subsection 301.05.
309.06 Surface Tolerance. Finish the surface according to Subsection 301.06.

238

rock type and sample location. Obtain samples representative of aggregates being furnished.
(2) SEP (SE/P200 (SE/P75) Index) is a measure of a material’s ability to perform based on the quality and quantity of fines present. Quality is represented by
the sand equivalent (SE) and quantity is represented by the percent passing the No. 200 (75-µm) sieve (P200 (75)). SEP is computed as follows:
For SE ≥ 29, SEP = SE/(P200 (75) + 25) and for SE < 29, SEP = (SE + 4)/(SE + P200 (75)).
Where: SE = Plastic fines in graded aggregates and soils by using the sand equivalent test. See AASHTO T 176, Alternate Method No.2, Reference
Method.
P200 (75) = Material finer than the No. 200 (75 µm) sieve in mineral aggregates by washing. See AASHTO T 11.

(d) Paver. Provide a paver conforming to Subsection 401.05 that is capable of picking up the entire
windrow and feeding it into the paver hopper. Do not heat the screed.
(e) Rollers. Provide double-drum steel wheel and pneumatic-tire rollers in sufficient quantity and size
to obtain the required density. Provide pneumatic-tire rollers weighing a minimum 30 tons (27 metric
tons).
310.06 Weather Limitations. Do not begin work when fog, showers, rain, frost, temperatures below 35 ºF
(2 °C) are anticipated within 24 hours.
Place cold in-place recycled asphalt base on a dry, unfrozen surface when the air temperature in the shade
and the road surface temperature are 50 ºF (10 °C) and rising.
310.07 Production Start-Up Procedures.
(a) Preparatory phase meeting. Conduct a pre-recycling preparatory phase meeting at least 7 days
before the start of recycling operations according to Subsection 153.04(a).
(b) Control strip. Provide 7 days notice before beginning production.
Construct the control strip on the project at an approved location. Recycle a 1500-foot (450-meter)
long control strip, one-lane wide, and at the designated lift thickness. Use the construction
procedures intended for the entire project. Cease production after construction of the control strip
until the recycled base layer and the control strip are evaluated and verified for acceptance.
Acquire three random samples of milled material from the control strip after the material has passed
through the crushing unit, but before emulsified asphalt is added for Type A compaction. Verify that
100 percent passes the 1½-inch (37.5-millimeter) sieve. Take density readings behind each roller
pass to determine the roller pattern necessary to achieve the maximum in-place density (break point
of compaction curve) according to ASTM D2950. Use the bulk specific gravity value from the mix
design as a benchmark for evaluating the maximum in-place density achieved.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. See Subsection 106.01
for the disposition of material in unacceptable control strips. Accepted control strips may remain in
place and will be measured as a part of the completed base course.
Full production may begin when a control strip is verified. Provide the CO with the maximum
in-place density achieved (Type A compaction), application rates of the emulsified asphalt, water,
and other additives used on the accepted control strip.
Use these start-up procedures when changing construction procedures, when resuming production after a
termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.04 or the beginning
of a new construction season.
310.08 Pavement Recycling and Mixing. Mill the existing pavement to the required depth and width.
Reduce oversize particles to a maximum size of 1½ inch (37.5 millimeters).
245

Section 310

When lime is required at the milling head or in the pugmill, incorporate lime slurry to within plus or minus
10 percent of the approved application rate. Produce the lime slurry using quicklime or hydrated lime and
water in a slurry production unit equipped with scales and meters accurate to within 0.5 percent by mass.
Agitate the transport and feed tanks to provide a consistent and pumpable lime slurry.
Combine milled material with emulsified asphalt, water, and lime at the approved application rates to
produce a homogenous and uniformly-coated mixture. Maintain the emulsified asphalt temperature
within the range recommended by the supplier.
Do not disturb underlying material. Synchronize the recycling rate to allow for continuous operation of
recycling train equipment.
Continuously monitor and evaluate the milling, mixing, and placing operations to assure optimum
quality of the recycled asphalt base course. Adjust application rates in coordination with the CO based
upon material variations.
310.09 Spreading, Compacting, and Finishing.
(a) Spreading. Spread, and finish the recycled mix to the required line, grade, and elevation.
(b) Compacting. Begin compaction within 30 minutes of spreading. Use pneumatic-tire rollers until
no displacement is observed. Use steel-wheel rollers, either in static or low-amplitude vibratory mode,
to achieve final density and eliminate pneumatic-tire roller marks. Do not park or idle rollers on
uncompacted material. Compact using the designated type:
(1) Type A compaction. Use roller patterns established during the control strip. Compact the
recycled mix to obtain a minimum density of 97 percent of the control strip density. Measure
in-place density according to ASTM D2950. If an area fails to meet required density, rework and
recompact the area.
If applications rates of the emulsified asphalt from the approved mix design are changed by more
than ±0.2 percent by mass of milled material, or if other material conditions distinctly change,
reestablish roller pattern according to Subsection 310.07(b).
(2) Type B compaction. Compact the recycled mix using the following equipment, sequence,
and number of roller passes:
(a) Four to six roller passes with a double drum, vibratory roller having a minimum mass of
5.5 tons (5 metric tons) and equipped with frequency and amplitude controls.
(b) Four to six roller passes with a pneumatic-tire roller having a minimum mass of
2000 pounds (910 kilograms) per wheel and a contact pressure of 80 pounds per square inch
(550 kilopascals).
(c) Two to four roller passes with a static steel-wheel roller with a minimum pressure of
250 pounds per square inch (1730 kilopascals).
Compact the material with approved tampers or compactors along curbs, headers, walls, and
places not accessible to the roller.

246

Section 310

(c) Finishing. Produce a surface that is smooth, dense, and free of ruts, ridges, and loose material.
Measure pavement surface according to Subsection 403.11, except defective areas are deviations
between the surface and the bottom of the straightedge in excess of ⅜ inches (10 millimeters),
measured between a two contacts of the straightedge, or at the end of the straightedge.
(d) Fog seal. Place a fog seal on the surface of the recycled asphalt base. Use emulsified asphalt
diluted to 50 percent by volume with water and apply it at a rate of 0.05 to 0.15 gallons per square yard
(0.25 to 0.70 liters per square meter). When necessary, place blotter according to Section 411.
310.10 Construction Joints.
(a) Longitudinal joints. Make longitudinal joints coincide with each change in cross-slope. Provide a
minimum longitudinal overlap of 4 inches (100 millimeters).
(b) Transverse joints. At the beginning of each day’s recycling operations or after extended work
stoppages, ensure continuity across transverse joints by cutting back into the completed work for a
distance recommended by the manufacturer of the cold recycling equipment.
310.11 Curing and Maintenance. Keep traffic and construction equipment off of the recycled asphalt
base for at least 2 hours after completing compaction and until it is sufficiently stable to withstand
raveling, marring, and permanent deformation. Route hauling and other construction equipment uniformly
over the full width of the recycled asphalt base to minimize non-uniform compaction.
Maintain the recycled asphalt base to the correct line, grade, and cross-section. Provide additional
rolling with a steel wheel roller to recompact and maintain a dense surface. Use a power broom to
remove loose particles. If the recycled asphalt base loses stability, density, or finish, reprocess and
recompact as necessary to restore the strength of the damaged material.
Place the next course or final surface when the moisture content of the recycled asphalt base is reduced
to 2.5 percent or less according to AASHTO T 255, but within 14 days after recycling regardless of
moisture content.
310.12 Acceptance. See Table 310-2 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.

Section 311. — STABILIZED AGGREGATE SURFACE COURSE
Description
311.01 This work consists of constructing a stabilized aggregate surface course with either imported or
in-place aggregate.
Aggregate stabilization is designated as imported aggregate course or in-place aggregate course.
Aggregate grading is designated according to Table 703-3.
Material
311.02 Conform to the following Subsections:
Calcium chloride flakes
Surface course aggregate (imported)
Water

725.02(b)
703.05
725.01(c)

Construction Requirements
311.03 Proportioning. Determine the proportioning quantities of aggregate, calcium chloride flakes, and
water required. Sample the imported aggregate or aggregate course before beginning stabilization
operations. Determine the maximum density and optimum moisture content according AASHTO T 180,
Method D. The CO will provide the target calcium chloride content by mass of the material at 95 percent
of the maximum density. Set target water content at the time of mixing between 2 percent below optimum
and optimum moisture content.
311.04 General. After a representative quantity of imported aggregate is produced, submit proposed
target values for the appropriate sieve sizes to the CO. Set target values for the aggregate within the
gradation ranges shown in Table 703-3. List the percent passing for sieve sizes shown in Table 703-3.
Store calcium chloride flakes in closed, weatherproof containers. Begin application or mixing operations
only when the ambient air temperature is 40 °F (4 °C) or above, and is not expected to fall below 40 °F
(4 °C) within 48 hours. Construct stabilized aggregate course when the underlying layer is dry and
unfrozen.
(a) Imported aggregate course. Prepare the underlying surface according to Subsection 303.05.
(b) In-place aggregate course. Prepare the surface according to Subsection 303.06.
311.05 Mixing and Placing.
(a) In-place mixing. When imported aggregates are used, spread aggregate on the prepared surface in
a uniform layer to the specified width.

252

Section 311

For an imported or in-place aggregate course; maintain the quantities of calcium chloride and water
content to within the following tolerances:
(1) Calcium chloride

±0.2 percent by total dry mass

(2) Water

±0.5 percent by total dry mass

Do not spread calcium chloride flakes in windy conditions that will result in loss of calcium chloride or
dusting. Do not spread more calcium chloride flakes than can be incorporated within one hour.
Spread calcium chloride flakes uniformly across the prepared aggregate surface. Use distributor or
rotary mixing equipment capable of metering and applying calcium chloride flakes and water
uniformly across the full width of the surface to be mixed. For distribution equipment, verify the
application rate by performing weight yield test panels for the first load of each distributor truck. For
rotary mixing equipment, verify the application rate by calculating yields.
Mix the calcium chloride flakes into the aggregate course with rotary mixing equipment capable of
uniformly mixing the material full depth in one pass.
Shape the aggregate course to the required cross-section after mixing is complete. Route hauling
equipment uniformly over the full width of the aggregate surface to minimize rutting or uneven
compaction.
(b) Pugmill mixing. Aggregates, calcium chloride flakes, and water may be mixed using a stationary
pugmill with weighing or metering equipment capable of controlling the material entering the mixer.
Interlock the metering controls for the aggregate feed with those of the calcium chloride flakes and
water to ensure uniform introduction of material into the mixer. Maintain the quantities of aggregate,
calcium chloride flakes, and water (based on the total dry mass) to within the following tolerances:
(1) Aggregate

±2.0 percent by total dry mass

(2) Calcium chloride

±0.2 percent by total dry mass

(3) Water

±0.5 percent by total dry mass

Haul and spread the material on the prepared surface in a uniform layer immediately after mixing.
Maintain the moisture content from optimum to 2 percent below optimum while placing and
spreading the mixture. Shape the aggregate course to the required cross-section. Route hauling
equipment uniformly over the full width of the surface to minimize rutting or uneven compaction.
311.06 Compacting and Finishing. Compact the mixture according to Subsection 301.05.
Finish the aggregate course according to Subsection 301.06 and produce a surface free of loose material.
311.07 Acceptance. See Table 311-1 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements; including the
acceptance quality characteristic category.
Calcium chloride flakes will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.03.
Surface course aggregate (imported) will be evaluated for gradation, fractured faces, liquid limit, and
plasticity index under Subsection 106.05. Other aggregate quality properties will be evaluated under
Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
253

Section 311

(a) Aggregate gradation. The upper and lower specification limits are equal to the calculated mean of
all test results plus or minus the allowable deviations shown in Table 703-3, except as follows:
(1) If the calculated mean value for a tested sieve exceeds the maximum gradation value shown
in Table 703-3, the upper specification is equal to the maximum gradation value plus the
allowable deviation, and the lower specification is equal to the maximum gradation value
minus the allowable deviation.
(2) If the calculated mean value for a tested sieve is less than the minimum gradation value
shown in Table 703-3, the upper specification is equal to the minimum gradation value plus the
allowable deviation and the lower specification is equal to the minimum gradation value minus
the allowable deviation.
(b) Fractured faces. When aggregate is produced from a gravel source, use the specification limit
shown in Subsection 703.05(a)(5).
(c) Liquid limit index. The specification limit is shown in Subsection 703.05(c)(2).
(d) Plasticity liquid limit. The specification limit is shown in Subsection 703.05(c)(3).
Construction of aggregate stabilization courses will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
Reconditioning of the aggregate course for in-place aggregate will be evaluated under Section 303.
Preparation of the surface on which the treated imported aggregate course is placed will be evaluated
under Section 303.
Measurement
311.08 Measure the Section 311 pay items listed in the bid schedule according to Subsection 109.02 and
the following as applicable:
When measuring surface course aggregate stabilization by the square yard (square meter), measure the
length horizontally along the centerline of the roadway. Measure width horizontally to include the top of
subgrade width and allowable widening.
Payment

(1) Do not heat the asphalt concrete mix above the temperature specified in the approved
asphalt concrete mix design.
(2) Do not pave.

401.08 Asphalt Preparation. Uniformly heat the asphalt binder to provide a continuous supply of heated
asphalt binder from storage to the mixer. Do not heat asphalt binder above 365 °F (185 °C).
If a liquid heat stable antistrip additive is used, meter it into the asphalt binder transfer lines at a bulk
terminal or mixing plant. Inject the additive for at least 80 percent of the transfer or mixing time to obtain
uniformity.
401.09 Aggregate Preparation. When lime is used as an antistrip, adjust the aggregate moisture to at
least 4 percent by mass of aggregate. Mix the lime uniformly with the aggregate before introducing the
aggregate into the dryer or dryer drum. Use calibrated weighing or metering devices to measure the
quantity of lime added to the aggregate.
For batch plants, heat, dry, and deliver aggregate for pugmill mixing at a temperature sufficient to
produce an asphalt concrete mix temperature within the approved range. Adjust flames used for drying
and heating to prevent damage to and contamination of the aggregate. Additional plant adjustments may
be required to provide dry aggregate at the reduced mixing temperatures of WMA.

272

Section 401

Control plant operations so the moisture content of the asphalt concrete mix behind the paver is
0.5 percent or less according to AASHTO T 329.
Before starting asphalt concrete mix production, obtain approval of synchronized metering and weighing
devices used to introduce a constant rate of lime and water.
Add lime to the aggregate by one of the following methods:
(a) Method A. Add lime to the combined cold feed aggregate using an enclosed in-line cold feed
mechanical pugmill mixer. Use a twin-shaft, continuous mixing pugmill with adjustable mixing
paddles. Adjust the retention time of the mixture in the pugmill so no unmixed lime is visible after
the lime and aggregate exit the pugmill.
(b) Method B. Add lime to the produced aggregates during stockpiling using a pugmill. Distribute
the lime per the stockpile ratios stated in the asphalt concrete mix design.
A minimum moisture content of 2 percent by dry weight for coarse aggregate and 4 percent by dry
weight for fine aggregate is required at the time the aggregates and lime are mixed. Marinate treated
aggregate in stockpiles from 24 hours to 60 days before using in asphalt concrete mix. Do not use
aggregate marinated longer than 60 days.
(c) Method C. Add lime to the combined cold feed aggregate by introducing the lime between
aggregate layers as the aggregate flows from the cold feed bins. Mix the lime and aggregate on the
conveyor belt by placing at least of six paddles over the conveyor belt. Make the paddles protrude into
the aggregate flow and direct the aggregate to fold over itself causing the material to migrate from one
side of the conveyor belt to the other. Space the paddles to provide complete mixing. Provide a water
spray over the conveyor belt as necessary to control dust and to maintain minimum moisture content.
401.10 Mixing. Measure the aggregate and asphalt into the mixer according to the JMF. Mix until
particles are completely and uniformly coated with asphalt according to AASHTO M 156. Maintain the
discharge temperature according to the JMF.
401.11 Hauling. Use vehicles with tight, clean, and smooth metal beds for hauling asphalt concrete mixes.
Coat the beds with an approved material to prevent the asphalt concrete mix from adhering to the beds. Do
not use petroleum derivatives or other coating material that contaminates or alters the characteristics of the
mix. Drain the bed before loading.
Equip each truck with a canvas cover or other suitable material of sufficient size to protect the asphalt
concrete mix from the weather. When necessary to maintain temperature, use insulated truck beds and
securely fastened covers. Provide access ports or holes for checking temperature of asphalt concrete mix in
the truck.
401.12 Production Start-Up Procedures.
(a) Preparatory phase meeting. Conduct a pre-paving preparatory phase meeting at least 3 days
before the start of paving operations according to Subsection 153.04(a). In addition, be prepared to
discuss the following:
(1) Calibration certification for the gyratory compactor; and
273

Section 401

(2) Asphalt and aggregate correction factors according to AASHTO T 308 and AASHTO T 30
on FHWA Form 1640, Worksheet for Ignition Furnace Binder Correction Factor AASHTO

(b) Control strip. Provide 7 days notice before beginning production of an asphalt concrete mix.
On the first day of production, produce sufficient asphalt concrete mix to construct a 1000-foot
(300-meter) long control strip, one-lane wide, and at the designated lift thickness. Construct the control
strip on the project at an approved location.
Construct the control strip using asphalt concrete mix production, lay-down, and compaction
procedures intended for the entire mix. Cease production after construction of the control strip until the
asphalt concrete mix and the control strip are evaluated for acceptance.
(1) Mixture. Take and test at least three control strip asphalt concrete mix samples and evaluate
according to Subsection 401.17. The asphalt concrete mix is acceptable if all test results are
within specification limits for asphalt content and VMA; and the calculated pay factor for asphalt
content, VMA, and gradation is 0.90 or greater.
(2) Compaction. Compact according to Subsection 401.14. Take nuclear gauge density readings
behind each roller pass to determine the roller pattern necessary to achieve required density.
Take nuclear gauge density readings and cut and test core samples according to Table 401-8.
Density is acceptable if the core density pay factor is 0.90 or greater. Furnish the CO with
documented nuclear gauge readings correlated to core specific gravities.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. See Subsection 106.01 for
the disposition of material in unacceptable control strips. Accepted control strips may remain in place
and will be accepted and measured as a part of the completed pavement. Tests used for the control strip
will not be included in the evaluation for payment according to Subsection 106.05. When a control
strip is verified and accepted, full production may begin.
Use these start-up procedures when producing material from a different plant or when resuming
production after a termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.05.
401.13 Placing and Finishing. Do not use mixes produced from different plants unless the mixes are
produced according to the same JMF, use material from the same sources, and are approved. Construct
control strips according to Subsection 401.12 for each plant from which production is intended.
Place HMA at a temperature conforming to Table 401-2. Place WMA at temperatures conforming to
Subsection 401.03. Measure temperature of the asphalt concrete mix in the hauling vehicle just before
dumping into the spreader or measure it in the windrow immediately before pickup.
Place the asphalt concrete mix with a paver conforming to Subsection 401.05. Control horizontal
alignment using a reference line. Automatically control the grade and slope from reference lines, a ski and
slope control device, or dual skis. Use skis having a minimum length of 20 feet (6 meters).

274

Section 401

In areas where mechanical spreading and finishing is impractical, place and finish the asphalt concrete mix
with alternate equipment to produce a uniform surface closely matching the surface obtained when using a
mechanical paver.
Offset the longitudinal joint of one layer at least 6 inches (150 millimeters) from the joint in the layer
immediately below. Make the longitudinal joint in the top layer along the striped centerline of two-lane
roadways or at the lane lines of roadways with more than two lanes.
401.14 Compacting. Furnish at least three rollers, with at least one being a pneumatic-tire roller.
Furnish one roller each for breakdown, intermediate, and finish rolling. Size the rollers to achieve the
required results. Operate rollers according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. Do not use diesel
fuel as a release agent with rollers used to compact asphalt concrete mix.
Monitor the compaction process with nuclear density gauges calibrated to the control strip core density test
results and compact according to Subsection 401.17(c).
Take nuclear gauge density readings and cut and test core samples according to Table 401-8.
Compact the asphalt concrete mix with alternate equipment to obtain the required compaction along forms,
curbs, headers, walls, and other places inaccessible to rollers.
401.15 Joints, Trimming Edges, and Cleanup. Complete pavement construction of adjacent traffic lanes
to the same elevation within 24 hours. If elevation differences exceeding 3 inches (75 millimeters)
between adjacent lanes are left overnight, sign with "Uneven Lanes" warning signs and provide a 1V:3H
fillet.
Make transverse joints vertical to the depth of the new pavement at connections to existing pavements and
previously placed lifts. Form transverse joints by cutting back the previous run to expose the full-depth
course.
Apply an asphalt tack coat to the edge of both transverse and longitudinal joints according to Section 412.
Place the asphalt concrete mix as continuously as possible. Do not pass rollers over an unprotected edge of
freshly laid asphalt concrete mix.
Dispose of material trimmed from the edges and other discarded asphalt concrete mix according to
Subsection 211.02(a)(2).
401.16 Pavement Roughness. Measure the profile of the pavement surface according to the designated
pavement roughness type. In addition, construct pavement surfaces to meet the requirements of Subsection
401.16(e).
(a) Profile measurement. The CO will use profile measurements to determine the Mean Roughness
Index (MRI) values for the traveled way using the current version of Profile Viewer and Analysis
(ProVAL) software. The CO will also determine areas of localized roughness. The MRI and areas of
localized roughness will be used to determine payment for the designated pavement roughness type
and pavement areas requiring surface corrections.

275

Section 401

Conform to the following:
(1) Equipment. Provide an ASTM E950, Class 1 inertial profiling system conforming to
AASHTO M 328 and certified according to AASHTO R 56. Provide copies of the system
certifications at least 21 days before profiling begins. Display a current decal on the equipment
indicating the expiration date of the certifications.
The CO may perform verification testing, equipment validation, or both as follows:
(a) Verification testing. Verification testing will consist of the CO profiling a section of
pavement and comparing the results against the Contractor’s results for the same section of
pavement. Comparison runs will be made within 21 days of each other. The Contractor’s
results will be considered verified if the CO’s International Ride Index (IRI) for each wheel
path differs from the Contractor’s IRI for the same wheel path by no more than 10 percent of
their mean. Do not use equipment that fails verification.
(b) Equipment validation. Equipment validation will consist of determining a cross
correlation value on at least one section of pavement having a minimum length of 528 feet
(161 meters). The Contractor’s profiler and the CO’s profiler will be cross correlated on the
same day. Coordinate and schedule the equipment validation date at least 14 days before the
validation date. The CO will determine the location of the cross correlation segments. The
Contractor’s equipment will be considered validated if the cross correlation value is greater
than or equal to 0.90. Do not use equipment that fails validation.
(2) Personnel. Provide the following:
(a) A profile system operator certified according to AASHTO R 56. Submit copies of the
operator’s certifications at least 21 days before profiling begins.
(b) Flaggers, pilot car operations, or other temporary traffic control according to Section 635
as required.
(3) Measuring. The CO will identify the beginning and ending points of the profile
measurements. Measure the pavement profile in both wheel paths using a sensor path spacing of
65 - 71 inches (1650 - 1800 millimeters) and centered in the traveled way of the lane. Operate
the inertial profiler according to AASHTO R 57 and the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do
not apply filters when collecting profile data. Filtering will be applied during profile analysis in
ProVAL. Collect profile data (elevation and distance) at a maximum interval of 2 inches (50
millimeters). Provide a lead-in distance of at least 150 feet (45 meters) after reaching the testing
speed. Use the profiler’s automatic start/stop activation when collecting data.
The CO will identify excluded areas. Cattle guards, bridges not being overlaid, and turning lanes,
passing lanes, side roads, and ramps less than 1,000 feet (300 meters) in length will be excluded
from profile measurement, the calculation of MRI, and the determination of localized roughness.
Use event markers to mark the beginning and ending location of areas to be excluded from
profile measurement. Measure excluded areas with a straightedge according to Subsection
401.16(e).
Coordinate profiling operations with the CO. Export each profile (elevation, distance data,
header, and marker information) in pavement profile format (ppf) to a CD or DVD and submit
after profiling. Do not submit non-continuous data files.

276

Section 401

Use the following naming convention for electronic file submissions:
(a) For Type I and Type II pavement roughness:
[Project Name (or abbreviation)] _ [beginning station_to_ending station] _ [Initial or
Final],
Beaver_Cr_Rd_25+50_to_387+35_Initial.ppf.
(b) For Type III pavement roughness:
[Project Name (or abbreviation)] _ [beginning station_to_ending station],
Beaver_Cr_Rd_25+50_to_387+35.ppf.
(4) Evaluation. The CO will review and analyze profile measurements. The MRI will be
calculated from profile measurements using ProVAL.
Using ProVAL, a high pass filter length of 300 feet (90 meters) and a low pass filter of 10 inches
(250 millimeters) will be applied to the profiles. Individual MRI values are determined by
averaging the IRI value from each wheel path. Fixed interval MRI values are reported as an
average of the individual MRI values over the fixed interval length. An overall MRI value will
be determined by averaging the individual MRI values, excluding segments less than 25 feet
(7.62 meters) for Type I and Type II pavement roughness or 528 feet (161 meters) for Type III
pavement roughness.
Areas of localized roughness will be identified by using ProVAL’s continuous MRI function
with a segment length of 25 feet (7.62 meters). This will yield an average MRI value and a
length for each area of localized roughness which exceeds the localized roughness threshold
value of every possible 25-foot (7.62-meter) segment. Areas for which the continuous report
exceeds the threshold MRI value for the specified roughness type will be considered a defective
area requiring correction. When corrections are not allowed, a reduction in payment will be
applied according to Subsection 401.16(f). No deduction will be made for areas of localized
roughness identified within 12.5 feet (3.81 meters) of the beginning or end of a profile section or
within 12.5 feet (3.81 meters) of excluded areas. Measure these areas with a straightedge
according to Subsection 401.16(e).
Correct areas of localized roughness according to Subsection 401.16(g).
(b) Type I pavement roughness. Measure the profile of the initial pavement surface before
construction activities disturb the existing pavement surface. The initial pavement surface is defined
as the existing pavement surface before construction actives begin. The localized roughness
threshold computed to the nearest whole number for Type I pavement roughness is equal to the
following:
Localized Roughness Threshold = Initial Overall MRI + 1.881(S25)
where:
Initial Overall MRI = MRI obtained before construction activities begin.
S25 = sample standard deviation of the 25 foot (7.62 meters) fixed interval MRI values.
Do not proceed with work that will disturb the initial pavement surface until the CO’s analysis is
complete.
277

Section 401

Measure the profile of the final pavement surface before placing a surface treatment and within
21 days of completing roadway paving. The original overall surface MRI will be used in conjunction
with the final overall MRI to determine an overall percent improvement for the entire traveled way.
The overall percent improvement in MRI will be determined to one decimal place for the traveled
way according to the following formula:
% Improvement = [(Initial Overall MRI – Final Overall MRI) / Initial Overall MRI] × 100
Table 401-3 will be used to determine the final pay factor (PFrough) for the traveled way to two
decimal places. When the percent improvement is less than 25.0 percent and the final overall MRI
value is less than or equal to 70.0 inches per mile (1.105 meters per kilometer), Type III-A from
Table 401-5 will be used to determine the final PFrough.
Correct areas of localized roughness according to Subsection 401.16(g). If a pavement has an overall
negative percent improvement, place a minimum 1-inch (25-millimeter) overlay over the entire
paved surface.

(c) Type II pavement roughness. Measure the profile of the initial pavement surface before
construction activities disturb the pavement surface. The initial pavement surface is defined as the
original existing pavement surface before construction actives begin. The localized roughness
threshold computed to the nearest whole number for Type II pavement roughness is equal to the
following:
Localized Roughness Threshold = Initial Overall MRI + 1.282(S25)
where:
Initial Overall MRI = MRI obtained before construction activities begin.
(S25) = sample standard deviation of the 25-foot (7.62-meter) fixed interval MRI values.
Do not proceed with work that will disturb the initial pavement surface until the CO’s analysis is
complete.
Measure the profile of the final pavement surface before placing a surface treatment and within
21 days of completing roadway paving. The original overall surface MRI will be used in conjunction
with the final overall MRI to determine an overall percent improvement for the entire traveled way.
The overall percent improvement in MRI will be determined to one decimal place for the traveled
way according to the following formula:
% Improvement = [(Initial Overall MRI – Final Overall MRI) / Initial Overall MRI] × 100
Table 401-4 will be used to determine the final PFrough for the traveled way to two decimal places.
When the percent improvement is less than 49.0 percent and the final overall MRI value is less than
or equal to 70.0 inches per mile (1.105 meters per kilometer), Type III-A from Table 401-5 will be
used to determine the final PFrough.
Correct areas of localized roughness according to Subsection 401.16(g). If a pavement has less than
a 10.0 percent improvement, place a minimum 1-inch (25-millimeter) overlay over the entire paved
surface.

indicated in Table 401-5 multiplied by the ratio of individual lane miles (lane kilometers)to the
overall project lane miles (lane kilometers)and by ProVAL’s corresponding histogram percentages,
divided by 100. The final PFrough will be determined to three decimal places.

(g) Defective area correction. Obtain approval before starting corrective work. Allow 7 days for
review and approval of correction method proposal.
Correct defective areas by one of the following methods:
(1) Milling. Replace the defective area by milling at least one-half the pavement depth and
repaving with the approved asphalt concrete mix. Mill the defective area according to Section
413.
(2) Saw cutting. Replace the defective area by saw cutting and removing the defective area and
repaving with the approved asphalt concrete mix. Saw cut and remove the defective area
according to Section 203.
(3) Grinding. Use a diamond blade machine to grind off the defective surface area. Provide the
manufacturer and model of the equipment to be used. Identify the beginning and ending station
of each grind location, the grinding depth, and lateral extent of grinding. Optimize the endpoints
of the areas where a grinder is to be applied using ProVAL’s Smoothness Assurance function in
conjunction with the grinding simulation function. Submit the type of seal to be placed after
grinding is completed for approval. Place seals according to Section 409 or 410. Limit the
grinding depth to 12.5 percent of the design pavement thickness. If grinding in excess of this
depth, provide a minimum 1-inch (25-millimeter) overlay.
(4) Other. Submit a proposal for approval for other correction methods not listed above.
282

Section 401

After corrections are made, re-measure the pavement profile according to Subsection 401.16(a).
Data from the re-measurement will be analyzed to determine the MRI or percent improvement, areas
of localized roughness, and the final PFrough. If correction and re-measurement of the surface is
required, the maximum allowable pay factor under Subsection 401.19 is 1.00.
If corrections are not allowed, no adjustment will be made to the final PFrough or localized roughness
pay deductions.
401.17 Acceptance. See Table 401-8 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Aggregate quality properties will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
Mineral filler, antistrip additives, and WMA additives will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and
106.03.
Asphalt content, VMA, and core density will be evaluated under Subsection 106.05. Pavement roughness
will be evaluated under Subsection 106.04. Asphalt binder will be evaluated under Subsections 106.03 and
106.04. Evaluations will consider the following:
(a) Asphalt content. The upper and lower specification limits are the approved JMF target value plus
or minus 0.4 percent;
(b) VMA. The lower specification limit is the value shown in Table 401-1. After the JMF has been
verified according to Subsections 401.03 and 401.12, use the Contractor’s combined coarse and fine
bulk specific gravity of aggregate Gsb values to calculate VMA on field produced asphalt concrete
mix samples;
(c) Density (core). The lower specification limit is 91.0 percent of the maximum specific gravity
(density) determined according to AASHTO T 166 and AASHTO T 209.
The percent compaction will be determined using the average maximum specific gravity (AASHTO
T 209) from all samples tested each day;
(d) Pavement roughness. The evaluation for payment will be made after defective areas are
addressed. See Subsection 401.16(g); and
(e) Asphalt binder. The pay factor is determined from Table 401-7.
Construction of the HMA or WMA pavement course will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and

for the work prescribed in this Section. See Subsection 109.05.
283

Section 401

Payment for asphalt concrete pavement will be made at a price determined by multiplying the contract
price by the material pay factor. The material pay factor is calculated as follows:
PFmaterial = 1 + [(PFVolumetric – 1) + (PFPG – 1)]
where:
PFmaterial =

Material pay factor.

PFVolumetric =

Pay factor for asphalt concrete pavement. PFVolumetric is the lowest single pay
factor determined for asphalt binder content, VMA, and core density.

PFPG =

Pay factor for asphalt binder. The PFPG formula is as follows:
PFPG = (PF1 + PF2 + PF3 + ….PFn) / n
where:
PF#= For each sample, the lowest pay factor determined from any test in Table
401-7. If the lowest pay factor for a sample is in reject, the sample’s
pay factor is zero.
n = Number of samples tested.

If either the pay factor for the asphalt binder (PFPG) or the pay factor for asphalt concrete pavement
(PFVolumetric) is below 0.75, the lot for asphalt concrete pavement is in reject.
When the contract specifies a pavement roughness Type I, Type II, or Type III, a separate pay
adjustment will be made for pavement roughness calculated as follows:
Type I, Type II, or Type III Pay Adjustment = (RF)(PFrough - 1.00)(L) – (LRPR)
where:
PFrough =

Pay factor from Tables 401-3, 401-4, or 401-5.

L=

Total project length in lane miles (lane kilometers).

LRPR =

Localized roughness pay reduction from Table 401-6.

RF =

Roughness factor: 40,000 U.S. Customary (24,800 Metric).

Sampling, Testing, and Acceptance Requirements
(1) Use AASHTO T 308, Method A. Calculate the asphalt binder content by weighing the sample before and after the burn using a calibrated external
balance.
(2) Cut two 6-inch (150-millimeter) diameter side by side cores. Remove them with a core retriever and fill and compact the core holes with asphalt
concrete mixture. Label the cores and protect them from damage due to handling and temperature. Submit one core for verification testing. Dry the
other core to constant mass at 125±5 °F (52±3 °C) or vacuum dry it according to ASTM D7227 before performing the core density and measuring the
thickness. Use 62.245 pounds per cubic foot (997.1 kilograms per cubic meter) to convert specific gravity to density.
(3) After production paving has begun, use the average maximum specific gravity value (AASHTO T 209) for each day to adjust the percent
compaction for the cores that represent that day’s paving.
(4) Do not use the supplemental procedure for mixtures containing porous aggregate (dry back method of AASHTO T 209).

(2) Asphalt and aggregate correction factors according to AASHTO T 308 and AASHTO T 30
on FHWA Form 1640, Worksheet for Ignition Furnace Binder Correction Factor AASHTO
T 308. If RAP is included as part of the JMF, provide the asphalt and aggregate correction
factors according to AASHTO T 30 and the FLH Addendum to AASHTO T 308 on FHWA
Form 1648, Worksheet For Ignition Furnace Binder Correction Factor And Aggregate Gradation
Correction Factor For Mixes Including Rap.
(b) Control strip. Provide 7 days notice before beginning production of an asphalt concrete mix.
On the first day of production, produce sufficient asphalt concrete mix to construct a 1000-foot
(300-meter) long control strip, one-lane wide, and at the designated lift thickness. Construct the control
strip on the project at an approved location.
Construct the control strip using asphalt concrete mix production, lay-down, and compaction
procedures intended for the entire mix. Cease production after construction of the control strip until the
asphalt concrete mix and the control strip are evaluated for acceptance.
(1) Mixture. Take and test at least three control strip asphalt concrete mix samples and evaluate
according to Subsection 402.17. The asphalt concrete mix is acceptable if all test results are
within specification limits for gradation and asphalt content and the calculated pay factor for
gradation and asphalt content is 0.90 or greater.
(2) Compaction. Take nuclear density gauge readings behind each roller pass to determine the
roller pattern necessary to achieve required density.
Take nuclear gauge density readings and cut core samples at least five locations within the
control strip. Test cores according to Subsection 401.17. Density is acceptable if all tests are
above the specification limit or the calculated pay factor is 0.90 or greater. Furnish the CO with
documented nuclear gauge readings and correlations of the readings to the core specific gravities
at completion of control strip.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. See Subsection 106.01 for
the disposition of material in unacceptable control strips. Accepted control strips may remain in place
and will be accepted and measured as a part of the completed pavement. Tests used for the control strip
will not be included in the evaluation for payment according to Subsection 106.05. When a control
strip is verified and accepted, full production may begin.
Use these start-up procedures when producing material from a different plant or when resuming
production after a termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.05.

Section 402

Mineral filler, antistrip additives, and WMA additives will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and
106.03.
Asphalt content, core density and aggregate gradation will be evaluated under Subsection 106.05.
Pavement roughness will be evaluated under Subsection 106.04. Asphalt binder will be evaluated under
Subsections 106.03 and 106.04. Evaluations will consider the following:
(a) Asphalt content. The upper and lower specification limits are the approved JMF target value plus
or minus 0.4 percent;
(b) Density (core). The lower specification limit is 91.0 percent of the maximum specific gravity
(density) determined according to AASHTO T 166 and AASHTO T 209. The percent compaction will
be determined using the maximum specific gravity (AASHTO T 209) from at least one production
sample per day;
(c) Aggregate gradation. The upper and lower specification limits are the approved JMF target values
plus or minus the allowable deviations shown in Table 703-5;
(d) Pavement roughness. The evaluation for payment will be made after defective areas are
addressed. See Subsection 401.16(g); and
(e) Asphalt binder. The pay factor is determined from Table 401-7.
Construction of the HMA or WMA pavement course will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and

402.19 The accepted quantities will be paid at the contract price per unit of measurement for the Section
402 pay items listed in the bid schedule, except for the asphalt concrete pavement, contract price will be
adjusted according to Subsections 106.05, 402.16, and Table 401-7. Payment will be full compensation
for the work prescribed in this Section. See Subsection 109.05.
Payment for asphalt concrete pavement will be made at a price determined by multiplying the contract
price by the material pay factor. The material pay factor is calculated as follows:
PFmaterial = 1 + [(PFVolumetric – 1) + (PFPG – 1)]
where:
PFmaterial =

Material pay factor.

PFVolumetric =

Pay factor for asphalt concrete pavement. PFVolumetric is the lowest single pay
factor determined for asphalt content, density, or aggregate gradation.

PFPG =

Pay factor for asphalt binder. The PFPG formula is as follows:
PFPG = (PF1 + PF2 + PF3 + ….PFn) / n
299

Section 402

where:
PF# = For each sample, the lowest pay factor determined from any test in
Table 401-7. If the lowest pay factor for a sample is in reject, the
sample’s pay factor is zero.
n=

Number of samples tested.

If either the pay factor for the asphalt binder (PFPG) or the pay factor for asphalt concrete pavement
(PFVolumetric) is below 0.75, the lot for asphalt concrete pavement is in reject.
When the contract specifies a pavement roughness Type I, Type II or Type III, a separate pay
adjustment will be made for pavement roughness calculated as follows:
Type I, Type II or Type III Pay Adjustment = (RF)(PFrough - 1.00)(L) – (LRPR)
where:
PFrough =

Pay factor from Tables 401-3, 401-4, or 401-5.

L=

Total project length in lane miles (lane kilometers) of traveled way as specified in
the contract.

LRPR =

Localized roughness pay reduction from Table 401-6.

RF =

Roughness factor: 40,000 U.S. Customary (24,800 Metric).

(b) Source and percentage of each stockpile to be used;
(c) Average gradation of each stockpile;
(d) Representative samples from each stockpile. Use split samples of material taken at the
same time samples are taken for testing by the Contractor’s laboratory.
(1) 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of aggregates proportioned by each stockpile according to
the JMF; and
(2) 5 pounds (2 kilograms) of mineral filler, if proposed for the JMF.
(e) Results of aggregate quality tests performed within 1 year of use. For aggregate quality
tests, see Subsection 703.08.
(2) Asphalt binder. See Subsection 401.03(c)(2).
(3) Antistrip additives. See Subsection 401.03(c)(3).
(b) Verification. The verification process starts when required documentation and material are
received. Do not begin OGFC production until the JMF is verified.
(1) Aggregate gradations. The Contractor’s aggregate gradation is verified if the CO’s
gradation on a combined OGFC mix using the Contractor’s aggregate stockpile percentage
recommendations is within the Contractor’s target value gradation plus or minus the following
tolerance for each sieve:
Sieve Size

Tolerance, % (±)

No. 4 (4.75 mm)

(2) Moisture susceptibility. The Contractor’s retained tensile strength result determined by
AASHTO T 283, except as modified by ASTM D7064; is verified if the CO’s result is
80 percent minimum.
(c) Changes and resubmissions. If a JMF is rejected or the source of material is changed, submit a
new JMF for verification. Up to 14 days may be required to evaluate a change after receipt of required
documentation and material. Approved changes in target values will not be applied retroactively for
payment.
The CO will deduct JMF evaluation costs resulting from the following:
(1) Contractor-requested changes to the approved JMF and
(2) Additional testing necessary due to the failure of a submitted JMF.

discharging the mix into the paver within 1½ hours of loading the truck. When surge bins are used, begin
this 1½-hour limit at the time the mix is deposited into the surge bin.
405.10 Compacting. Roll the OGFC mix before the mix temperature drops below 200 °F (93 °C) or the
temperature recommended by the asphalt binder manufacturer. Use a steel-wheeled roller for compacting
the mix. Do not shove, distort, or strip the mix beneath the roller. Roll the mix parallel to the centerline,
commencing at the outside edge and progressing towards the center. On superelevated curves, begin the
rolling on the low side and progress to the high side. Limit rolling to that necessary to consolidate the
OGFC and bond it to the underlying surface.
405.11 Joints and Cleanup. Use butt joints for longitudinal and transverse joints. Protect the completed
OGFC from traffic until it has sufficiently hardened to resist abrasion, pickup, and raveling.
Dispose of material trimmed from the edges and other discarded asphalt concrete mix according to
Subsection 211.02(a)(2).
405.12 Straightedge Measurement. See Subsection 403.11.
405.13 Acceptance. See Table 405-2 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Aggregate quality properties will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
Mineral filler and antistrip additive will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.03.
Asphalt binder will be evaluated under Subsections 106.03 and 106.04.
Asphalt content and aggregate gradation will be evaluated under Subsection 106.05. Evaluations will
consider the following:
(a) Asphalt content. The upper and lower specification limits are the approved JMF target value plus
or minus 0.4 percent.
(b) Aggregate gradation. The upper and lower specification limits are the approved JMF target values
plus or minus the allowable deviations shown in Table 703-5.

150-meter) control strips that are one-lane wide according to Subsections 407.09 and 407.10. Coordinate
the control strip locations with the CO. Start the first control strip at the proposed application rates. Vary
the asphalt material or surface aggregate application rate for each control strip. Construct the control strip
using the material, lay-down procedures, and compaction procedures intended for the entire project.
Repeat the control strip process until an acceptable control strip is produced. Cease production until the
material and the control strip are evaluated and accepted. The CO will indicate which strip will serve as
the approved project control strip.

325

Section 407

Acceptable control strips may remain in place and will be accepted as a part of the completed project.
Correct unacceptable control strips.
Use these start-up procedures when changing construction procedures, when resuming production after a
termination of production due to unsatisfactory quality according to Subsection 106.04, or the beginning
of a new construction season.
407.09 Asphalt Application. Calibrate asphalt distributors before the start of project and when directed
by the CO. Calibrate the spray bar height, check nozzle angle, and verify longitudinal and transverse
application rates according to ASTM D2995.
Spread building paper on the pavement surface at the beginning and end of each asphalt application so
distributor flow is started and stopped on the paper.
Apply asphalt uniformly at the optimum application rate determined from the control strip. Do not apply
more asphalt than can immediately be covered with aggregate. Correct skipped areas or deficiencies.
At the end of each day’s production, provide the CO with documentation of calibrations and application
rates.
Remove and dispose of material spills and associated debris at the end of each shift according to
Subsection 203.05(a) and (d).
407.10 Aggregate Application. When emulsified asphalt is used, verify the aggregate stockpile
moisture daily and use moist surfaced aggregate.
When asphalt binder is used, dry the aggregate. Precoat the aggregate uniformly with 2 to 3 percent of
residual asphalt by mass of aggregate. Maintain the flow qualities of the precoated aggregate to allow
uniform spreading with the aggregate spreader.
Calibrate aggregate spreaders before the start of project and as directed by the CO. Calibrate the
longitudinal and transverse spread rates.
Apply aggregate uniformly at the optimum application rate determined from the approved control strip.
Apply the aggregate immediately after the asphalt material is applied. Operate the aggregate spreader so
asphalt is covered with the aggregate before wheels pass over it. For part-width construction, leave an
uncovered 6-inch (150-millimeter) wide asphalt strip to permit an overlap of asphalt material.
Cover excess asphalt with blotter to protect traffic.
Correct excesses and deficiencies by adding or removing aggregate to achieve a uniform texture before
the asphalt cures.
Operate rollers at a maximum speed of 5 miles (8 kilometers) per hour. Do not allow the aggregate to be
displaced by pickup or sticking of material to the tire surface. Roll the surface to uniformly and
thoroughly bond the aggregate over the full width. Complete rolling within 1 hour after asphalt is
applied to the surface. Perform three passes with the rollers. Do not allow traffic to travel over aggregate
until rolling is completed.

326

Section 407

At the end of each day’s production, provide the CO with documentation for calibrations and application
rates.
Use a pilot car according to Section 635 to limit traffic speeds to 10 miles (15 kilometers) per hour
during the first 45 minutes after rolling and to 20 miles (30 kilometers) per hour for the next 24 hours.
Sweep the surface when the air temperature is below 90 °F (32 °C). Do not displace embedded material.
Complete vacuum sweeping by the morning after construction. Dispose of material according to
Subsection 203.05(a) and (d).
407.11 Placing and Finishing. Apply the asphalt and aggregate according to Subsections 407.09 and
407.10 and Table 407-1. The application rates in these tables are for estimating purposes only.
Determine the exact rates based on approved control strips.

407.13 Acceptance. See Table 407-3 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Emulsified asphalt and asphalt binder will be evaluated under Subsections 106.03 and 106.04. Furnish a
production certification with each load of emulsified asphalt or asphalt binder.
Chip seal aggregate gradation will be evaluated under Subsection 106.05.
The upper and lower specification limits are equal to the calculated mean of all test results plus or minus
the allowable deviations shown in Table 703-7, except as follows:
(a) If the calculated mean value for a tested sieve exceeds the maximum gradation value shown in
Table 703-7, the upper specification is equal to the maximum gradation value plus the allowable
deviation, and the lower specification is equal to the maximum gradation value minus the allowable
deviation.

328

Section 407

(b) If the calculated mean value for a tested sieve is less than the minimum gradation value shown in
Table 703-7, the upper specification is equal to the minimum gradation value plus the allowable
deviation, and the lower specification is equal to the minimum gradation value minus the allowable
deviation.
Construction of asphalt chip seals will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02 and 106.04.
Measurement
407.14 Measure the Section 407 pay items listed in the bid schedule according to Subsection 109.02.
Payment
407.15 The accepted quantities will be paid at the contract price per unit of measurement for the Section
407 pay items listed in the bid schedule, except the chip seal contract price will be adjusted according to
Subsection 106.05. Payment will be full compensation for the work prescribed in this Section. See
Subsection 109.05.
Payment for the chip seal will be made at a price determined by multiplying the contract price by the
material pay factor. The material pay factor is the lowest single pay factor determined for each specified
sieve of the aggregate gradation for each aggregate gradation furnished.
When two gradations are furnished for a double chip seal the material pay factor is weighted for the
quantity of each aggregate gradation spread as a percent of the total. The material pay factor is
calculated as follows:
PFMaterial = PF1st[SR1st/(SR1st + SR2nd)] + PF2nd[SR2nd/(SR1st + SR2nd)]
where:
PFMaterial =

Material pay factor.

PF1st =

Pay factor for first aggregate gradation. PF1st is the lowest single pay factor
determined for each specified sieve.

PF2nd =

Pay factor for second aggregate gradation. PF2nd is the lowest single pay factor
determined for each specified sieve.

SR1st =

Spread rate for the first aggregate per square yard (square meter).

SR2nd =

Spread rate for the second aggregate per square yard (square meter).

(g) Traffic control plan.
Conform to Subsections 552.04 through 552.08 and 552.10 for weather limitations, handling, storing,
batching, and mixing material and delivering concrete.
Deposit concrete between the forms to a uniform height. Consolidate concrete to remove voids and air
pockets. Do not move concrete horizontally with vibrators.
Strike off and place concrete with a form-riding paving machine or manual fixed form paving equipment.
In irregular areas where a paving machine is impractical, place concrete using templates, screeds, or other
methods approved by the CO.
Carry a slight excess of concrete in front of the leading edge of the template or screed. After strikeoff and
before bleed water appears on the surface, float to the required grade and cross-section. Finish the concrete
pavement to minus ¼ inch (6 millimeters) or plus ⅜ inch (10 millimeters) of the thickness required.
When concrete is placed adjoining a previously-constructed lane of pavement, do not operate mechanical
equipment on the existing lane until the lane has attained:
•
•

A minimum flexural strength of 450 pounds per square inch (3.1 megapascals) according to
AASHTO T 23 and AASHTO T 97; or
A compressive strength of 3,000 pounds per square inch (21 megapascals) according to AASHTO
T 22 and AASHTO T 23.

When required, place reinforcing steel according to Section 554. If placing rebar before placing concrete,
position the rebar on acceptable supports. If placing rebar after placing concrete, mechanically insert the
rebar to the required depth. Reinforcing bars and steel supports are to be epoxy-coated. Keep epoxy-coated
reinforcing steel free of damage and distortion. Steel wire fabric and mats are not required to be
epoxy-coated.
When rain is threatening during paving operations, stop paving operations and protect the concrete
pavement from rain with plastic sheeting or other methods approved by the CO. Remove, replace, or repair
pavement damaged by rain or hail as directed by the CO at no cost to the Government.
501.08 Joints. Construct joints at locations and dimensions indicated in the plans. If jointing locations are
not indicated in the plans, submit a jointing plan according to Subsection 104.03. Indicate locations of
contraction, construction, and isolation joints.
Do not vary longitudinal joints more than ½ inch (13 millimeters) and transverse joints more than ¼ inch
(6 millimeters) from true alignment. When curbs or medians are constructed integral with the pavement,
construct transverse joints continuous through the curb or median. Clean joints of deleterious material,
including concrete slurry, and protect the joints until sealed.
(a) Longitudinal joints. Construct longitudinal construction joints by using steel fixed forms and a
keyway along the joint.
362

Section 501

Where required, place deformed steel tie bars perpendicular to the longitudinal joints with mechanical
equipment or rigidly secured chairs without damaging or disrupting the concrete. Along longitudinal
construction joints, tie bars may be bent at right angles against the form of the first lane constructed
and straightened into final position before placing concrete in the adjacent lane. Repair or replace
broken or damaged tie bars.
Threaded hook bolts may be used instead of tie bars. Fasten hook bolts to the form of the longitudinal
construction joint.
Construct joints as follows:
(1) Formed joints. Form joints with an approved nonmetallic or removable device while the
concrete is plastic, but set sufficiently to maintain the formed joint. When adjacent lanes are
constructed separately, form the sealant reservoir in the lane placed last.
(2) Sawed joints. After placing concrete, saw joints approximately ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) wide
as soon as equipment can be supported and before uncontrolled cracking occurs. Do not ravel the
joints while sawing. Saw longitudinal joints immediately after sawing transverse joints. Protect
the sawed concrete faces from drying during the curing period. Saw sealant reservoirs no sooner
than 72 hours after placing the concrete.
If necessary, continue sawing day and night, regardless of weather conditions.
Do not saw a joint if a crack occurs at or near the joint location before sawing. Discontinue
sawing when a crack develops ahead of the saw.
Remove and replace newly-placed concrete pavement where uncontrolled cracking occurs. Dowel and
tie replacement pavement to adjacent pavement as specified.
(b) Transverse contraction joints. When required, construct contraction joints according to
Subsection 501.08(a)(1) or (a)(2).
Where required, place dowel bars through and centered on traverse joints and in the middle of the slab
depth. Align and hold dowels parallel to the surface and centerline of the slab by a metal assembly that
remains in the pavement and is rigidly secured to the base or subgrade using stakes or nails. Limit
deviations from parallel to ¼ inch (6 millimeters) in the length of the dowel bar. Assure proper
alignment of joint and dowel bar assemblies.
Coat each dowel bar with an approved bond breaker. Limit bond breaker coating thickness to 15 mils
(380 micrometers).
Concrete edges adjacent to the joint may be rounded or beveled to a radius no greater than ¼ inch
(6 millimeters) or as approved. Resaw or grind joints having an insufficient opening. Where a joint is
larger than required, furnish a larger size joint seal as approved.
(c) Transverse construction joints. Construct transverse construction joints only at locations
specified, at the end of each work shift, or when concrete placement is interrupted for more than
30 minutes. If necessary, remove and dispose of the excess concrete to the last preceding joint.
When required, install dowel bars in transverse construction joints according to Subsection 501.08(b).

363

Section 501

Use a metal or wooden bulkhead to form the joint, shaped to the pavement cross-section and designed
to permit the installation of dowel bars.
(d) Isolation joints. Form isolation joints around manholes, utility boxes, foundations, other fixed
objects, or as indicated in the plans. Place a ½-inch (13-millimeter) pre-formed joint filler continuously
around or along each structure that extends into or through the pavement before concrete is placed.
After the concrete hardens, recess the joint filler about ¾ inch (19 millimeters) to allow a reservoir for
sealant.
When required, place steel wire fabric at the location and orientation specified. Use metal or plastic chairs
or other methods approved by the CO to support the steel wire fabric.
501.09 Surface Finishing. Protect the surface from rain damage.
After floating, check the surface of the fresh concrete with a 10-foot (3-meter) straightedge. Remove high
areas indicated by the straightedge. Lap each successive check with the straightedge 5 feet (1.5 meters)
over the previous check path.
Before the concrete has initially set, work the pavement edges on each side of isolation joints, formed
joints, transverse and longitudinal construction joints, and emergency construction joints to produce a
¼ inch (6 millimeters) or less continuous radius and a smooth, dense mortar finish. Do not use mortar
buildup to round edges.
As soon as excess moisture has disappeared and while the concrete is still plastic enough to make a
granular surface possible, texture the surface to produce a skid resistant surface. Use the method specified
and conform to the following:
(a) Transverse tine finish. Drag two layers of moistened burlap along the pavement in the direction of
paving without tearing or marring the surface. Following the burlap drag, use a tining comb to form
grooves in the pavement surface. Space tines randomly ½ to ¾ inches (13 to 19 millimeters) apart.
Produce grooves that are 1/16 to 3/16 inches (1.6 to 5 millimeters) wide and ⅛ to 3/16 (3 to 5 millimeters)
inches deep. Tine perpendicular to the centerline without tearing the concrete surface or loosening
surface aggregate.
(b) Broom finish. Broom the surface with a steel or stiff-bristled fiber broom to produce corrugations
between 1/16 and ⅛ inch (1.6 to 3 millimeters) deep. Broom perpendicular to the centerline from edge
to edge with adjacent strokes slightly overlapped. Use the same type and manufacture of broom for all
paved surfaces to provide a consistent appearance.
(c) Exposed aggregate finish. Broom the surface. Use stiff brushes approved by the CO. Exercise care
to prevent marring of the surface and cracking or chipping of slab edges or joints. If approved by the
CO, apply a light spray of retardant to the unfinished surface to facilitate this work.
Broom transversely across the pavement. Pull the loosened semi-stiff mortar off the pavement.
Remove the mortar from adjacent pavement. Broom parallel to the centerline. Continue this operation
until a sufficient quantity of coarse aggregate is exposed. Other methods of aggregate exposure will be
permitted if satisfactory results are demonstrated.
After curing, wash the surface with water and brush to remove laitance and cement from the exposed
coarse aggregate.
364

Section 501

501.10 Curing. Immediately after finishing and when marring will not occur; cure the surface and
exposed sides of concrete for at least 72 hours. Do not leave the concrete exposed for more than
30 minutes during the curing period. Cure using one of the following methods:
(a) Water method. Cure according to Subsection 552.15(b). Cover the entire surface of the pavement
and edges of the slab with water saturated mats. Extend the mats at least twice the thickness of the
pavement beyond the edges of the slab. Place the mats in complete contact with the surface. Use
weights or other approved methods to maintain contact; or
(b) Liquid membrane curing compound method. Cure according to Subsection 552.15(c).
Remove forms when the concrete has hardened sufficiently to resist damage, but no earlier than 12 hours
after placing concrete. Protect the sides of the exposed slabs with a curing method equal to that provided
for the surface. Prevent erosion of the base course beneath the exposed pavement edges until shoulders are
constructed.
501.11 Sealing Joints. Saw cut and seal joints before the pavement is opened to construction or public
traffic.
Where sealant reservoirs are required, clean each sealant reservoir of foreign material including membrane
curing compound and concrete slurry. Blow dry joints with moisture free compressed air. Do not apply
sealing material unless the joint faces are clean and surface dry, and the joint is free of incompressibles.
Use preformed joint seals, silicone sealant, or hot-poured sealant for isolation joints. Use silicone or
hot-poured sealants for longitudinal and transverse contraction joints.
(a) Silicone or hot-poured sealants. Install backer rod with a steel wheel to the depth required. Do not
stretch or twist the backer rod during installation. Limit the length of backer rod installed to that which
can be sealed during the same workday.
Place joint sealing material when the air temperature is over 40 °F (4 °C) or as specified by the
manufacturer. Remove excess or spilled material and clean the pavement surface. Do not use sand or
similar material to cover the seal. For sealants that are not self-leveling, tool the surface of the sealant
to the dimensions required in the plans.
(b) Preformed joint seals. Furnish the seal in one piece in the size specified for the joint opening.
Install seals with a lubricant adhesive covering both sides of the joint. Compress the seal to between
20 and 50 percent of its nominal width or as specified by the manufacturer. Install the top of the seal
about ¼ inch (6 millimeters) below the pavement surface.
Remove and replace seals that are damaged, twisted, improperly positioned, or stretched more than
3 percent.
501.12 Pavement Straightedge Measurement. Measure the pavement surface after the concrete has
cured. Use a 10-foot (3-meter) metal straightedge to measure at right angles and parallel to the centerline.
Defective areas are deviations between the surface and the bottom of the straightedge in excess of
¼ inches (6 millimeters), measured between two contacts of the straightedge, or deviations in excess of
¼ inches (6 millimeters) measured at the end of the straightedge.
Correct defective areas by diamond grinding, slab removal, or other methods approved by the CO.
365

Section 501

501.13 Opening to Traffic. Do not allow traffic on new concrete pavement earlier than 14 days after
concrete placement unless concrete tests indicate one of the following conditions is obtained:
(a) Flexural strength of 550 pounds per square inch (4 megapascals) according to AASHTO T 97; or
(b) Compressive strength of 4000 pounds per square inch (28 megapascals) according to
AASHTO T 22.
Do not allow traffic on the pavement when joint sealant is tacky and traffic debris would imbed into the
sealant.

372

Section 502

Repair saw overcuts of repair areas and nicks to adjacent pavement outside the perimeter of the
repair area with nonshrink grout.
(b) Joints. Construct joints according to Subsection 501.08 and the following:
Install dowels, tie bars, or both into existing concrete pavement slabs as shown in the plans. Drill
dowel or tie bar holes into the face of the existing concrete at the required diameter, length, and
spacing using a drill according to Subsection 502.04(d)(2). Clean and dry the holes before installing
the dowels or tie bars. Use an epoxy resin to permanently anchor the dowel or tie bar into the
existing concrete. Place the epoxy resin starting from the back of the hole and use a sufficient
quantity to insure the epoxy material will be forced up and around the dowel or tie bar after
insertion. Place a thin, donut-shaped grout retention disk around the dowel or tie bar and up against
the face of the existing concrete to prevent epoxy resin material from flowing out of the hole.
Seal joints according to Subsection 501.11.
(c) Welded wire reinforcement. When required, provide 4- by 4-inch (100- by 100-millimeter), W6
by W6 (M15 by M15) steel welded wire reinforcement for crack control. Support welded wire fabric
on chairs or bolsters.
(d) Concrete placement. Compact base and subgrade material within the patch area according to
Subsection 302.05. Construct side forms to overlap the ends of the existing slab. Securely fasten side
forms so they do not move when concrete is placed. To accommodate forms for the patch, excavate
the adjacent shoulders a maximum width of 12 inches (300 millimeters). Place concrete according to
Subsection 501.07.
Cast each patch in one continuous full-depth operation. After removal of the forms, backfill,
compact, and return the excavated shoulder area to its previous condition.
(e) Finishing and coloring concrete. Finish patches according to Subsection 502.05(e).
502.07 Resealing Joints and Crack Repair. This work consists of repairing or resealing joints and
cracks in existing concrete pavement.
(a) Preparation of joints and cracks. Limit the length of joints and cracks prepared to that which
can be resealed within the same shift. Do not damage joints or previously repaired patches.
Remove existing sealant with a waterblaster, router, concrete saw, or other method approved by the
CO.
Remove old sealant from the crack faces to expose new, clean concrete. When the crack widths vary
and the crack faces are raveling and irregular, cut a crack reservoir to a depth of ¾ inch
(19 millimeters).
Thoroughly clean the joint or crack of foreign material by sandblasting, waterblasting, or with a
mechanical wire brush. Repeat the process until a new, clean concrete face is exposed. Dry the joint
with compressed air.

373

Section 502

Use sawing if other methods do not properly clean the joint. Limit sawing to exposing clean, new,
concrete faces in the joint with a maximum allowable cut of ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) on each face of
the joint.
(b) Backer rod. Install the backer rod to the required depth after the joints and cracks are clean and
dry. Do not stretch or twist the backer rod during installation. Limit the length of backer rod installed
to that which can be sealed during the same shift.
(c) Sealant application. Seal joints and cracks immediately after placing the backer rod. Apply
sealant at air and surface temperatures recommended by the sealant manufacturer. Comply with
installation recommendations provided by the sealant manufacturer. If the joint or crack becomes
contaminated or damp, remove the backer rod, clean and dry the joint or crack, and reinstall a new
backer rod before placing the sealant. For a non-self-leveling joint sealant, tool the sealant
immediately after application to provide firm contact with the joint faces and to form the required
recess below the slab surface.
502.08 Pavement Jacking. This work consists of raising and supporting the concrete pavement to the
specified grade tolerances by drilling and injecting non-shrink hydraulic cement grout.
(a) Drilling holes. Determine a pattern for grout injection holes and submit for approval. Drill
vertical holes less than 2 inches (50 millimeters) in diameter.
(b) Jacking. Establish string lines from the pavement high points to monitor slab movement. Lower
an expanding rubber packer or hose into the holes. Provide a positive seal and connected to the
discharge hose on the grout plant. Do not allow the discharge end of the packer or hose to extend
below the bottom of the concrete pavement.
Allow pumping to raise the pavement to within ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) of the string line grade when
jacking continuously-reinforced concrete pavement. Allow pumping to raise the pavement to within
¼ inch (6 millimeters) of the transverse and longitudinal grades when jacking jointed pavement and
bridge approach slabs.
Continuous jacking pressures to 200 pounds per square inch (1.4 megapascals) are permitted. Use
pressures to 300 pounds per square inch (2.1 megapascals) only for short periods of 30 seconds or
less. If the pavement is bonded to the subbase, brief pressure rises of 10 seconds or less to
600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) may be allowed. Stop pumping if grout extrudes
through cracks, joints, or shoulders. Discontinue pumping if back pressure in the hose exceeds
600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals).
(c) Overjacking. Grind pavement raised above the specified tolerances to grade. Remove and
replace the pavement according to Subsection 502.06 if the overjacking is greater than 1 inch
(25 millimeters).
(d) Cracks. Radial cracks from the grout injection holes will be considered caused by improper
injection technique. Remove and replace the slab or a portion of the slab with more than 10 feet
(3 meters) of new cracks according to Subsection 502.06. For slabs with less than 10 feet (3 meters)
of new cracks, seal cracks according to Subsection 502.07.

374

Section 502

(e) Hole patching. After completing the jacking and the hole plugs are removed, fill drill holes flush
with the pavement surface with a nonshrink grout or epoxy mortar.
502.09 Undersealing and Slab Stabilization. This work consists of pumping a nonshrink grout mixture
through holes drilled in the pavement into voids underneath the slabs to stabilize and underseal concrete
pavement.
(a) Preliminary testing. Perform testing at night or when there is no evidence of slab lock-up due
to thermal expansion. Testing may be allowed to continue if the slabs are not interlocked or under
compression. Furnish testing equipment as provided in Subsection 502.04(h). Test each designated
slab using a static method as follows:
(1) Position one set of gauges with one gauge referenced to the corner of each slab on both sides
of the joint near the pavement edge;
(2) Set the gauges to zero with no load on the slab on either side of the joint;
(3) Move the test truck into position and stop with the center of the test axle 12 inches
(300 millimeters) behind the joint and the outside test wheel 12 inches (300 millimeters) from
the pavement edge. Read the back gauge;
(4) Move the test truck across the joint to a similar position 12 inches (300 millimeters) forward
from the joint and stop. Read the forward gauge; and
(5) Repeat for each joint to be tested. Underseal slabs with a deflection of more than 1/32 inch
(0.08 millimeters).
(b) Drilling holes. Drill holes using the required hole pattern. An altered hole pattern may be
approved based on field conditions. Drill vertical holes less than 2 inches (50 millimeters) in
diameter to provide a positive seal for the pumping nozzle. For the first undersealing, drill holes to a
depth that penetrates into unbound base or subgrade. Avoid penetrating the subgrade by more than
3 inches (75 millimeters).
(c) Cleaning holes. After the holes are drilled and before pumping the underseal grout, clean the
hole with compressed air to remove debris and provide a passage for the grout.
(d) Pumping underseal grout. Pump nonshrink grout in each hole. Seal the nozzle of the discharge
hose in the hole to maintain the nonshrink grout pressure underneath the slab. Do not allow the
nozzle end to extend below the bottom of the concrete. Monitor slab lift according to Subsection
502.08. Limit upward movement of the pavement to ⅛ inch (3 millimeters).
Continue pumping into a hole until grout flows out other holes, joints, or cracks, or until the slab
begins to lift. Stop grouting if there is lift in the slab or the adjacent shoulder.
During stabilization operations, limit continuous pumping pressures to 125 pounds per square inch
(0.9 megapascals). Allow a short pressure surge of up to 300 pounds per square inch (2 megapascals)
when starting to pump grout into the hole to ensure grout penetrates the void structure. Do not plug
other holes while grouting.
Grind pavement raised more than the ⅛ inch (3 millimeters).

375

Section 502

(e) Cracks. If cracks develop, complete the required repairs according to Subsection 502.07.
(f) Hole patching. See Subsection 502.08(e).
(g) Stability testing. Test for stability 24 hours after designated slabs have been undersealed
according to Subsection 502.09 (a). Complete a second underseal operation on slabs that continues
to show excess movement. Submit the number, depth and location of holes for the second
undersealing for approval. The CO may accept or direct replacement of slabs that continues to show
movement in excess of that specified after undersealing twice. Remove and replace designated slabs
according to Subsection 502.06.
502.10 Surface Diamond Grinding. This work consists of grinding existing concrete pavement to
eliminate joint or crack faults and providing positive lateral drainage. Uniformly transition auxiliary or
ramp lane grinding from the mainline edge to provide positive drainage and an acceptable riding surface.
Provide a grinding unit conforming to the requirements of Subsection 502.04(e).
Produce a pavement surface that is true to grade, smooth, and consisting of a longitudinal corduroy-type
texture. Produce grooves between 0.08 and 0.15 inches (2 to 4 millimeters) wide. Produce a surface area
between the grooves between 0.065 and 0.125 inches (1.7 to 3.5 millimeters) wide. Produce peak ridges
approximately 1/16 inch (1.6 millimeters) higher than the grooves. Adjust blade spacing to achieve the
specified texture. Establish a positive and immediate means for removal of grinding residue. Remove
and dispose of solid residue from the pavement surfaces before it is blown by traffic action or wind. Do
not allow residue to flow into gutters or drainage facilities.
Test the ground pavement surfaces for pavement roughness according to Subsection 501.12. Limit
misalignment of surface planes on adjacent sides of the joints or cracks and between each grinding pass
to less than 1/16 inch (1.6 millimeters). Produce a transverse slope of the pavement with no depressions
or slope misalignment greater than ¼ inch in 10 feet (6 millimeters in 3 meters) tested perpendicular to
the centerline. Straightedge requirements do not apply across longitudinal joints or outside of ground
areas.
502.11 Concrete Cleaning. This work consists of cleaning the existing concrete pavement surface with
a high pressure washing device approved by the CO. Remove dust, dirt, oil, and other foreign material
(including the existing crack sealant material) without causing damage to the surface or exposing coarse
aggregate.
Vacuum the concrete surface to remove and collect water and debris after the pavement cleaning.
Dispose of the water and debris at a site approved by the CO.
502.12 Opening to Traffic. Do not allow traffic on restored pavement until the concrete has a
compressive strength of 4000 pounds per square inch (28 megapascals) when tested according to
AASHTO T 22 or until the grout used for jacking or undersealing the pavement has attained 600 pounds
per square inch (4 megapascals) when tested with a 0.25 square inch (64 square millimeters) probe
according to AASHTO T 197. As an alternative method of determining the compressive strength of the
restored pavement; in situ compressive strength can be measured by developing a strength-maturity
relationship of the approved concrete mixture according to AASHTO T 325. Submit the strengthmaturity relationship for approval at least 14 days before production. Provide a concrete maturity meter
during the test placement and production that meets the following:

376

551.05 Pile Driving Equipment. Furnish equipment conforming to the following requirements:
(a) Pile hammers.
(1) Gravity hammers. Gravity hammers may only be used to drive timber piles. Furnish a
hammer with a ram weighing between 2,000 and 3,500 pounds (900 and 1600 kilograms) and
limit the drop height to 12 feet (3.7 meters). Select a ram mass greater than the combined mass of
the drive head and pile. Provide hammer guides to ensure concentric impact on the drive head.
(2) Open-end diesel hammers. Equip open-end (single acting) diesel hammers with a device,
such as rings on the ram to permit visual determination of hammer stroke. Submit a chart from
the hammer manufacturer equating stroke and blows per minute for the hammer to be used. A
speed versus stroke calibration may be used if approved.

383

Section 551

(3) Closed-end diesel hammers. Submit a chart, calibrated to actual hammer performance
within 90 days of use, equating bounce chamber pressure to either equivalent energy or stroke
for the hammer to be used. Equip hammers with a dial gauge for measuring pressure in the
bounce chamber. Make the gauge readable from ground level. Calibrate the dial gauge to allow
for losses in the gauge hose. Verify the accuracy of the calibrated dial gauge during driving
operations by ensuring that cylinder lift occurs when bounce chamber pressure is consistent with
the maximum energy given in the hammer specifications. Do not use closed-end diesel hammers
that do not attain cylinder lift at the maximum energy-bounce chamber pressure relationship
given in the hammer specification.
(4) Air or steam hammers. Furnish plant and equipment for steam and air hammers with
sufficient capacity to maintain the volume and pressure specified by the hammer manufacturer.
Equip the hammer with accurate pressure gauges that are easily accessible. Use a hammer with
the mass of the striking parts equal to or greater than one third the combined mass of the driving
head and pile. Ensure the combined mass is at least 2,750 pounds (1250 kilograms).
Measure inlet pressures for double-acting and differential-acting air or stream hammers with a
needle gauge at the head of the hammer when driving test piles. If required, also measure inlet
pressures when driving production piles. A pressure versus speed calibration may be developed
for specific driving conditions at the project as an alternative to periodic measurements with a
needle gauge.
(5) Nonimpact hammers. Use nonimpact hammers, such as vibratory hammers when specified.
Use nonimpact hammers for installing production piles only after the pile tip elevation or
embedment length for safe support of the pile load is established by static or dynamic load
testing. Control the installation of production piles when using vibratory hammers by power
consumption, rate of penetration, specified tip elevation, or other acceptable methods that ensure
the required pile load capacity is obtained. Strike piles with an impact hammer of suitable energy
to verify the required pile capacity is obtained on at least one of every ten piles.
(6) Hydraulic hammers. Provide a power plant for hydraulic hammers with sufficient capacity
to maintain the volume and pressure, specified by the manufacturer, at the hammer under
working conditions. Equip the power plant and equipment with accurate pressure gauges that are
easily accessible to the CO.
(b) Approval of pile-driving equipment. Furnish pile-driving equipment that permits permanent piles
to be driven with reasonable effort and to the required depths and resistances without damage.
Approval of pile-driving equipment will be based on a wave equation analysis unless the contract
specifies the dynamic formula to determine the nominal driven pile capacity.
Use only the approved equipment represented in the wave equation analysis during pile-driving
operations. Approval of the pile-driving system is specific to the equipment submitted. If the proposed
equipment is modified or replaced, re-evaluate and resubmit the analysis and revised data for approval
before using. Approval of a pile hammer does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for piles
damaged due to driving stress.
(1) Wave equation. The required number of hammer blows indicated by the wave equation at
the nominal pile capacity is between 2 and 10 blows per inch (25 millimeters).

384

Section 551

In addition, do not allow the pile stresses resulting from the wave equation analysis to exceed the
values at which pile damage is impending. The point of impending damage is defined for steel,
concrete, and timber piles as follows.
(a) Steel piles. Limit the compressive driving stress to 90 percent of the yield strength of the
pile material.
(b) Concrete piles. Limit the tensile (TS) and compressive (CS) driving stresses to:
TS ≤ 3fc'1/2 + EPV for US Customary

TS ≤ 0.25fc'1/2 + EPV for Metric

CS ≤ 0.85fc' - EPV for US Customary

CS ≤ 0.85fc' - EPV for Metric

where:
fc’ = The 28-day design compressive strength of the concrete in pounds per square
inch (megapascals)
EPV = The effective prestress value in pounds per square inch (megapascals)
(c) Timber piles. Limit the compressive driving stress to:

σdr = φda(FCO) where:
σdr = limiting driving stress (ksi or kilonewtons)
φda = resistance factor, drivability analysis
FCO = base resistance of wood in compression parallel to the grain (ksi or
kilonewtons)
(2) Minimum hammer energy. The energy of the driving equipment submitted for approval, as
rated by the manufacturer, will be determined by a wave equation analysis.
(c) Driving appurtenances.
(1) Hammer cushion. Equip impact pile-driving equipment, except gravity hammers, with a
suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer or pile and to
ensure uniform driving behavior. Fabricate hammer cushions from durable, manufactured
material according to the hammer manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not use wood, wire
rope, or asbestos hammer cushions. Place a striker plate, as recommended by the hammer
manufacturer, on the hammer cushion to ensure uniform compression of the cushion material.
Inspect the hammer cushion in the presence of the CO when beginning pile driving at each
structure or after each 100 hours of pile driving, whichever is less. Replace the cushion when its
thickness is reduced by more than 25 percent of its original thickness;
(2) Pile drive head. Provide adequate drive heads for impact hammers. Provide appropriate
drive heads, mandrels, or other devices for special piles according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Align the drive head axially with the hammer and pile. Fit the drive head
around the pile head so that transfer of torsional forces is prevented during driving and proper
alignment of hammer and pile is maintained;

385

Section 551

(3) Leads. Support piles in line and position with leads while driving. Construct pile driver leads
to allow freedom of movement of the hammer while maintaining axial alignment of the hammer
and the pile. Do not use swinging leads unless permitted in writing or specified in the contract.
When swinging leads are permitted fit swinging leads with a pile gate at the bottom of the leads
and in the case of battered piles, fit with a horizontal brace between the crane and the leads.
Adequately embed leads in the ground or constrain the pile in a structural frame (template) to
maintain proper alignment. Provide leads of sufficient length that do not require a follower, but
will permit proper alignment of battered piles;
(4) Followers. Do not use followers unless approved. When followers are permitted, drive the
first pile in each bent or substructure unit and every tenth pile thereafter, full length without a
follower, to verify that adequate pile embedment is being attained to develop the required
nominal capacity. Provide a follower of such material and dimensions that will permit the piles
to be driven to the required penetration. Hold and maintain follower and pile in proper alignment
during driving;
(5) Jetting. Do not use jetting unless approved. Provide jetting equipment with sufficient
capacity to deliver a consistent pressure equivalent to at least 100 pounds per square inch
(700 kilopascals) at two ¾-inch (19-millimeter) jet nozzles. Jet so as not to affect the lateral
stability of the final in-place pile. Remove jet pipes when the pile tip is at least 5 feet
(1.5 meters) above the prescribed tip elevation, and drive the pile to the required nominal
capacity with an impact hammer. Control, treat if necessary, and dispose of jet water in an
approved manner;
(6) Pile cushion. For concrete piles, use a new pile cushion to protect the head of each pile. Cut
the pile cushion at least 4 inches (100 millimeters) thick and to match the cross-section of the
pile top. Replace the pile cushion if it is compressed more than one-half its original thickness or
it begins to burn. For steel and timber piles, protect each pile with an approved driving cap.
Enclose timber piles with approved collars or bands to prevent splitting or brooming. Replace
caps when damaged. Do not reuse cushions or caps; and
(7) Pile shoes. When specified, provide shoes to protect the pile-tip from damage during driving.
Fabricate shoes to snugly fit the pile tip. For concrete piles, attach the shoe to the pile using
dowels or other approved methods. For steel piles, design and fit the shoe to the steel shape and
weld the shoe to the pile so as not to stress the web or the flange. For timber piles, carefully
shape the tip to secure an even uniform bearing for the pile shoe. Treat holes, cuts, or caps in
treated timber piles with two-brush applications of creosote-coal tar solution according to
AWPA.
551.06 Pile Lengths. Furnish piles with sufficient length to obtain the required resistance and to extend
into the pile cap or footing as indicated in the plans. In addition, increase the length to provide fresh
heading and to provide for the Contractor's method of operation. When test piles are required, furnish piles
in the lengths determined by the test piles.
551.07 Test Piles. Install test piles when specified in the contract.
Place the piles designated as dynamic load test piles in a horizontal position and not in contact with other
piles. Drill holes for mounting instruments near the head of the pile. Mount the instruments after the pile is
in leads and take wave speed measurements. Provide at least a 48- by 48-inch (1200- by 1200-millimeter)
rigid platform with a 42-inch (1050-millimeter) safety rail that can be raised to the top of the pile.

386

Section 551

Excavate the ground at the site of each test pile or production pile to the elevation of the bottom of the
footing before the pile is driven. Furnish test piles longer than the estimated length of production piles.
Drive test piles with the same equipment as the production piles.
Drive test piles to the required nominal capacity at the estimated tip elevation. Allow test piles that do not
attain the required nominal capacity at the estimated tip elevation to set up for 24 hours before re-driving.
Warm the hammer before re-driving begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. If the required
nominal capacity is not attained on re-driving; drive a portion or the remaining test pile length and repeat
the set up and re-drive procedure as directed. Splice and continue driving until the required nominal pile
capacity is obtained.
Conform to the requirements for production piles when test piles are to be used in the completed structure.
Remove test piles not incorporated in the completed structure to at least 24 inches (600 millimeters) below
finished grade.
551.08 Driven Pile Capacity. Drive piles to the specified penetration and to the depth necessary to obtain
the required nominal pile capacity. Splice piles not obtaining the required nominal capacity at the ordered
length, and drive with an impact hammer until the required nominal pile capacity is achieved.
Use the wave equation to determine nominal pile capacity of the in-place pile.
(a) Wave equation. Adequate penetration will be considered to be obtained when the specified wave
equation resistance criteria is achieved within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the designated tip elevation. Drive
piles that do not achieve the specified resistance within these limits to a penetration determined by the
CO.
(b) Dynamic formula. Drive the piles to a penetration necessary to obtain the nominal pile capacity
according to the FHWA Gates Formula:
R ndr = 1.75 E d log10 (10N b ) − 100
R ndr = 7 E d log10 (10N b ) − 550

(US Customary)

(Metric)

where:
Rndr

= Nominal pile resistance measured during pile driving in kips (kilonewtons)

Ed

=Developed hammer energy. This is the kinetic energy in the ram at impact
for a given blow. If ram velocity is not measured, it may be assumed equal
to the potential energy of the ram at the height of the stroke, taken as the
ram mass times the stroke (foot-pounds or joules)

log10(10Nb)

= Logarithm to the base 10 of the quantity 10 multiplied by N

Nb

= Number of hammer blows per inch (25 millimeters) at final penetration

387

Section 551

Determine the in-place nominal capacity of jetted piles based on impact hammer blow counts
(dynamic formula) after the jet pipes have been removed. After the pile penetration length necessary
to produce the required nominal pile capacity has been determined by impact hammer blow count,
install the remaining piles in each group or in each substructure unit to similar depths with similar
methods. Confirm the required nominal pile capacity has been achieved by using the dynamic
formula.
551.09 Preboring. Use auguring, wet rotary drilling, or other approved methods of preboring.
Prebore the pile hole to natural ground in compacted embankments more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep.
In natural ground, preboring may extend to the surface of the rock or hardpan for piles end-bearing on rock
or hardpan. Seat the pile into the end-bearing strata.
Stop preboring at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) above the estimated pile tip elevation and drive the pile with an
impact hammer to a penetration which achieves the required nominal pile capacity for piles not
end-bearing on rock or hardpan. Prebore holes smaller than the diameter or diagonal of the pile
cross-section while allowing penetration of the pile to the specified depth.
Increase the hole diameter to the least dimension adequate for pile installation if the subsurface
obstructions such as boulders or rock layers are encountered. Fill remaining void space around the pile
with sand or other approved material after driving is complete. Do not use a punch or a spud instead of
preboring.
Do not impair the capacity of existing piles or the safety or condition of adjacent structures. If preboring
disturbs the capacity of previously installed piles or structures, restore the required nominal capacity of
piles and structures by approved methods.
551.10 Preparation and Driving. Perform the work under Section 208. Make the heads of piles plane and
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile. Coordinate pile driving to prevent damage to other parts
of the completed work.
Drive pile heads to within 3 inches (75 millimeters) of plan location at cutoff elevation for bent caps
supported by piles and to within 6 inches (150 millimeters) of plan location from piles capped below final
grade. Locate and drive piles at least 4 inches (100 millimeters) from any edge of the cap. Drive piles so
that the axial alignment is within ¼ inch per foot (20 millimeters per meter) along the longitudinal axis of
the required alignment. The CO may stop driving to check the pile alignment. Check alignment before the
last 5 feet (1.5 meters) are driven for piles that cannot be internally inspected after installation. Do not pull
laterally on piles or splice to correct misalignment. Do not splice a properly aligned section on a
misaligned pile.
Place individual piles in pile groups either starting from the center of the group and proceeding outward in
both directions or starting at the outside row and proceeding progressively across the group.
Correct piles driven improperly, driven out of proper location, misaligned, or driven below the designated
cutoff elevation in an approved manner. Replace piles damaged during handling or driving. Obtain
approval for the proposed methods of correcting or repairing deficiencies.

388

Section 551

(a) Timber piles. Do not use piles with checks wider than ½ inch (13 millimeters). Drive treated
timber piles within 6 months after treatment. Handle and care for pressure-treated piles according to
AWPA, Standard M 4 Standard For The Care Of Preservative-Treated Wood Products.
(b) Steel piles. Furnish full-length, un-spliced piles for lengths up to 60 feet (18 meters). If splices are
required in the first pile driven and it is anticipated that subsequent piles will also require splices, place
the splices in lower third of the pile. Splice lengths less than 10 feet (3 meters) are not permitted and
only 2 splices per pile are allowed.
Load, transport, unload, store, and handle steel piles so the metal is kept clean and without damage. Do
not use piles that exceed the camber and sweep permitted by allowable mill tolerance. Steel piles
damaged during installation are unacceptable unless the minimum tip elevation is obtained and load
tests show the bearing capacity is 100 percent of the required nominal. Perform tests on damaged piles
at no cost to the Government. If driving points are required, weld driving points to steel piles according
to AASHTO/AWS, Structural Welding Code - Steel D1.1 (D1.1M) or AWS, Bridge Welding Code
D1.5 (D1.5M) as applicable.
(c) Precast and prestressed concrete piles. Support concrete piles during lifting or moving at the
points shown in the plans. Provide support at the quarter points if not specified. Furnish slings or other
equipment when raising or transporting concrete piles to avoid bending the pile or breaking edges.
Reject concrete piles with reduced strength caused by external defects such as spalls, cracks, or
internal defects such as cavities revealed with non-destructive testing.
(d) Concrete-filled pipe or steel shell piles. Furnish and handle the steel shells or pipes according to
Subsection 551.10(b). Cutting shoes for shells or pipes may be inside or outside the shell. Use highcarbon structural steel with a machined ledge for shell bearing or cast steel with a ledge designed for
attachment with a simple weld.
Drive pile shells or pipes for a substructure unit before placing concrete in the shells or pipes when
practical. Do not drive pile shells or pipes within 15 feet (5 meters) of concrete-filled pile shell or pipe
until the concrete has cured for at least 7 days or 3 days if using high-early-strength concrete. Do not
drive pile shell or pipe after it is filled with concrete.
Remove and replace shells that are determined to be unacceptable for use due to breaks, bends, or
kinks.
551.11 Splices. Align and connect pile sections so the axis of the spliced pile is straight.
(a) Steel piles. Use welders certified for structural welding.
Make surfaces to be welded smooth, uniform, and without loose scale, slag, grease, or other material
that prevents proper welding. Steel may be oxygen cut. Carbon-arc gouging, chipping, or grinding may
be used for joint preparation.

389

Section 551

Weld according to AASHTO/AWS, Structural Welding Code - Steel D1.1 (D1.1M) or AWS, Bridge
Welding Code D1.5 (D1.5M). Weld the entire pile cross-section using prequalified AWS groove weld
butt joints. Weld so there is no visual evidence of cracks, lack of fusion, undercutting, excessive
piping, porosity, or inadequate size. Do not use manufactured splices unless approved in writing or
shown in the plans. Manufactured splices may be used in place of full penetration groove butt welds if
the Contractor can prove they can develop the full strength of the pile in compression, tension and
bending.
(b) Concrete pile splices. Use dowels or other acceptable mechanical means to splice precast concrete
or precast prestressed concrete piles. Submit drawings of proposed splices for approval.
If dowels are used, cast the dowels into the tip end of the following pile with corresponding holes at
the butt end of the driven pile. Serrate the holes to provide a mechanical bond. Separate the ends of the
piles by at least ½ inch (13 millimeters). Clean surfaces and dowel holes. Grout the dowels in place
and allow the grout to cure. Enclose the gap with forms and inject a bonding agent capable of
withstanding the impact and driving forces and having the same compressive strength as the pile.
Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding the use and curing of grouting and bonding
products.
Attach manufactured splices to the concrete piles as recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure the
splice develops strengths in compression, tension, and bending equal to or exceeding the strength of
the pile being spliced.
(c) Concrete pile extensions.
(1) Precast concrete piles. Extend precast concrete piles by removing the concrete at the end of
the pile and leaving 40 diameters of reinforcement steel exposed. Remove the concrete to
produce a face perpendicular to the axis of the pile. Securely fasten reinforcement of the same
size as that used in the pile to the projecting reinforcing steel. Form the extension to prevent
leakage along the pile.
Immediately before placing concrete, wet the top of the pile thoroughly and cover with a thin
coating of neat cement, re-tempered mortar, or other suitable bonding material. Place concrete of
the same mix design and quality as that used in the pile. Keep forms in place for not less than
7 days after the concrete has been placed. Cure and finish according to Section 552.
(2) Prestressed piles. Extend prestressed precast piles according to Subsection 551.11(b).
Include reinforcement bars in the pile head for splicing to the extension bars. Do not drive
extended prestressed precast piles.
(d) Timber piles. Do not splice timber piles.
551.12 Heaved Piles. Check for pile heave during the driving operation. Take level readings immediately
after each pile is driven and again after piles within a radius of 15 feet (5 meters) are driven. Re-drive piles
that heave more than ½ inch (13 millimeters) for end-bearing piles or 1½ inches (38 millimeters) for
friction piles. Re-drive to the specified resistance or penetration.
551.13 Pile Load Tests. Pile load tests are not required unless specified.
(a) Dynamic load test. Furnish equipment and perform dynamic load tests according to ASTM D4945
under the supervision of the CO. Mount the instruments according to Subsection 551.07.
390

Section 551

Drive the pile to the depth at which the dynamic test equipment indicates that the required nominal pile
capacity is achieved. If necessary to maintain stresses in the pile below the values in Subsection
551.03(b)(1), reduce the driving energy transmitted to the pile by using additional cushions or reducing
the energy output of the hammer. Realign the driving system if nonaxial driving is indicated.
At least 24 hours after the initial driving, re-drive each dynamic load test pile with instrumentation
attached. Warm the hammer before re-driving by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. Re-drive
the dynamic load test pile for a maximum penetration of 3 inches (75 millimeters), a maximum of
20 blows, or to practical driving refusal, whichever occurs first. Practical driving refusal is defined as
12 blows per inch (15 blows per 25 millimeters) for steel piles, 10 blows per inch (8 blows per
25 millimeters) for concrete piles, and 5 blows per inch (5 blows per 25 millimeters) for timber piles.
Verify the assumptions used in the initial wave equation analysis submitted according to Subsection
551.03(b) using signal matching analysis. Analyze one blow from the original driving and one blow
from the re-driving for each pile tested.
Perform additional wave equation analyses with adjustments based on the signal matching analysis
results. Provide a graph showing blow count versus nominal capacity. Provide a blow count versus
stroke graph for the nominal capacity of open-ended diesel hammers. Provide the driving stresses,
transferred energy, and pile capacity as a function of depth for each dynamic load test.
Based on the results of the dynamic load testing, signal matching analyses, and wave equation
analyses, the order list and production driving criteria may be approved and the required cut-off
elevations provided, or additional test piles and load testing may be specified. This information will be
provided within 7 days after receipt of the order list and required test data for the test piles driven.
(b) Static load tests. Perform static load tests according to ASTM D1143 using the quick load test
method, except as modified herein. Submit drawings of the proposed loading apparatus for approval
according to the following:
(1) Have a professional engineer prepare the drawings;
(2) Furnish a loading system capable of applying 150 percent of the nominal pile capacity or
1,000 tons (9000 kilonewtons), whichever is less; and
(3) Construct the apparatus to allow increments of load to be placed gradually without causing
vibration to the test pile.
Perform test at least 5 days after test pile was driven unless approved by the CO. Drive tension piles at
the location of permanent piles when feasible if tension (anchor) piles are required. Do not use timber
or tapered piles installed in permanent locations as tension piles. Take the test to plunging failure or the
capacity of the loading system, whichever occurs first.
The nominal bearing resistance is defined as 50 percent of the failure load. The failure load is defined
as follows:
• For piles 24 inches (600 millimeters) or less in diameter, length of side for square piles or
diagonal width, the load that produces a settlement at failure of the pile head equal to:
Sf = S + (0.15 + 0.008 D) (U.S. Customary)

391

Section 551

Sf = S + (3.8 + 0.008 D) (Metric)

• For piles greater than 24 inches (600 millimeters) in diameter, length of side for square piles or
diagonal width:
Sf = S +

D
30

where:
Sf = Settlement at failure in inches (millimeters)
D = Pile diameter or diagonal width in inches (millimeters)
S

= Elastic deformation of pile in inches (millimeters)

Determine top elevation of the test pile immediately after driving and again just before load testing to
check for heave. Wait at least 3 days between the driving of anchor or load test piles and the
commencement of the load test. Before testing, re-drive or jack to the original elevation piles that heaves
more than ¼ inch (6 millimeters).
After completion of the load testing, remove or cut off test or anchor piling not a part of the finished
structure at least 24 inches (600 millimeters) below either the bottom of footing or the finished ground
elevation.
Based on the results of the static load testing, the order list and production driving criteria may be
approved and the required cut-off elevations provided or additional load tests may be specified. This
information will be provided within 7 days after receipt of the order list and required test data for the test
piles driven.
551.14 Pile Cutoffs. Cut off the tops of permanent piles and pile casings at the required elevation. Cut off
the piles clean and straight parallel to the bottom face of the structural member in which they are
embedded. Dispose of cutoff lengths according to Subsection 203.05(a).
Treat the heads of treated timber piles which are not embedded in concrete by one of the following
methods:
(a) Reduce the moisture content of the wood to no more than 25 percent with no free moisture on the
surface. Brush apply one application of creosote-coal tar solution as required in AWPA Standards.
Build up a protective cap by applying alternate layers of loosely woven fabric and hot asphalt or tar,
similar to membrane waterproofing, using three layers of asphalt or tar and two layers of fabric. Use
fabric at least 6 inches (150 millimeters) wider in each direction than the diameter of the pile. Turn
the fabric down over the pile and secure the edges by binding with two turns of No. 10
(3-millimeter) galvanized wire. Apply a final layer of asphalt or tar to cover the wire. Neatly trim the
fabric below the wires.
(b) Cover the sawed surface with three applications of a hot mixture of 60 percent creosote and
40 percent roofing pitch, or thoroughly brush coat with three applications of hot creosote and cover
with hot roofing pitch. Place a covering of galvanized sheet metal over the coating and bend down
over the sides of each pile.

392

Section 551

551.15 Unsatisfactory Piles. Correct unsatisfactory piles by an approved method. Methods of correcting
unsatisfactory piles may include one or more of the following:
(a) Use of the pile at a reduced capacity;
(b) Install additional piles;
(c) Repair damaged piles; and
(d) Replace damaged piles.
551.16 Placing Concrete in Steel Shell or Pipe Piles. Clean the inside of shells and pipes by removing
loose material after driving. Keep the shell or pipe substantially water tight. Remove water before placing
concrete or place the concrete using a tremie when water is present in the pile. Provide suitable equipment
for inspecting the entire inside surface of the driven shell or pipe just before placing concrete.
(a) Reinforcing steel. Make the spacing between adjacent cage elements at least five times the
maximum size of aggregate in the concrete when reinforcing steel is required.
Securely tie concrete spacers or other approved spacers at fifth points around the perimeter of the
reinforcing steel cage. Install spacers at intervals not to exceed 10 feet (3 meters) measured along the
length of the cage.
Place the reinforcement cage into the driven shell or pipe when the concrete reaches the planned

398

Section 552

552.04 Handling and Storing Material. Handle and store material in a manner that prevents segregation,
contamination, or other harmful effects. Do not use cement and fly ash containing evidence of moisture
contamination. Store and handle aggregate in a manner that ensures uniform moisture content at the time
of batching.
552.05 Measuring Material. Batch the concrete according to the approved mix design and the following
tolerances:
(a) Cement

±1 percent

(b) Water

±1 percent

(c) Aggregate

±2 percent

(d) Additive

±3 percent

552.06 Batching Plant, Mixers, and Agitators. Use a batching plant, mixer, and agitator conforming to
AASHTO M 157.
552.07 Mixing. Mix the concrete in a central-mix plant or in truck mixers. Operate equipment within
manufacturer’s recommended capacity. Produce concrete of uniform consistency.
(a) Central-mix plant. Dispense liquid admixtures through a controlled flowmeter. Use dispensers
with sufficient capacity to measure, at one time, the full quantity of admixture required for each batch.
If more than one admixture is used, dispense each with separate equipment.
Charge the coarse aggregate, one-third of the water, and all air-entraining admixture into the mixer
first, then add remainder of the material.
Mix for at least 50 seconds. Begin mixing time after all cement and aggregate are in the drum. Add the
remaining water during the first quarter of the mixing time. Add 4 seconds to the mixing time if timing
starts the instant the skip reaches its maximum raised position. Transfer time in multiple-drum mixers
is included in mixing time. Mixing time ends when the discharge chute opens.
Remove the contents of an individual mixer before a succeeding batch is charged into the drum.
(b) Truck mixer. Do not use mixers with blades worn 1 inch (25 millimeters) or more below the
original manufactured height. Do not use mixers and agitators with accumulated hard concrete or
mortar in the mixing drum.
Add admixtures to the mix water before or during mixing.
Charge the batch into the drum so a portion of the mixing water enters before the cement.
Mix each batch of concrete according to AASHTO M 157.
552.08 Delivery. Produce and deliver concrete to permit a continuous placement with no concrete
achieving initial set before the remaining concrete being placed adjacent to it. Deliver, handle, and place
concrete so as to minimize rehandling of the concrete and prevent damage to the structure.
Do not place concrete that has developed an initial set. Do not re-temper concrete by adding water.
399

Section 552

If a hydration stabilizing admixture is approved for use in the concrete mix, deliver and place the concrete
within the approved design discharge time limit. Limit the slump loss to no more than 2 inches
(50 millimeters) during the stabilization period. An approved and compatible hydration activator may be
used at the discharge site to ensure proper placement and testing.
(a) Truck mixer/agitator. Use the agitating speed for rotation after mixing. When a truck mixer or
truck agitator is used to transport concrete that is completely mixed in a stationary central construction
mixer, mix during transportation at manufacturer’s recommended agitating speed. Do not exceed
100 total revolutions at mixing speed, including both initial mixing and remixing.
If the concrete has not obtained an initial set, water and admixtures in the approved mix design may be
added one time at the project to obtain the required slump or air content. Limit the total of water in the
mix so as not to exceed the maximum water/cementitious material ratio of the approved mix design.
Remix the concrete and added water or admixtures with 30 revolutions at mixing speed. After the
initial introduction of mixing water to cement or cement to aggregates, complete the remixing within
the time specified in Table 552-4. After the beginning of the addition of the cement, complete the
discharge of the concrete within the time specified in Table 552-5.

(3) Sampling and testing according to Table 552-9; and

401

Section 552

(4) If hydration stabilizing admixture is used, determining the slump before placement. Do not
use concrete with a slump loss of more than 2 inches (50 millimeters) as compared to the slump
recorded at the batch plant.
552.10 Temperature and Weather Conditions. Maintain the temperature of the concrete mixture just
before placement between 50 and 90 °F (10 and 32 °C), except for bridge decks between 50 and 80 °F
(10 and 27 °C).
(a) Cold weather. Cold weather is defined as a period when for more than 3 consecutive days the
following conditions exist:
(1) Average of the highest and the lowest temperatures occurring during the period from midnight
to midnight is less than 40 °F (5 °C); and
(2) Air temperature is not greater than 50 °F (10 °C) for more than one-half in a 24-hour period.
When cold weather is reasonably expected or has occurred within 7 days of anticipated concrete
placement; submit a detailed plan for the producing, transporting, placing, protecting, curing, and
temperature monitoring of concrete during cold weather. ACI 306, Guide to Cold Weather Concreting
may be used for guidance in developing the plan. Include procedures for accommodating abrupt
changes in weather conditions. Do not start placement until the plan is accepted. Allow at least 3 day
for review and approval of the plan.
Have material and equipment required for protection available at the project before commencing cold
weather concreting.
Remove snow, ice, and frost from the surfaces, including reinforcement and subgrade, against which
the concrete is to be placed. Heat surfaces that come into contact with fresh concrete to at least 35 °F
(2 °C) and maintain the temperature of these surfaces at 35 °F (2 °C) or above during concrete
placement.
Place heaters and direct ducts so as not to cause concrete drying or fire hazards. Vent exhaust flue
gases from combustion heating units to the outside of enclosures. Heat the concrete components in a
manner that is not detrimental to the mix. Do not heat cement or permit the cement to come into
contact with aggregates that are hotter than 100 °F (40 °C). Do not heat aggregates with a direct flame
or on sheet metal over fire. Do not heat fine aggregate by direct steam. Do not add salts to prevent
freezing.
Protect concrete for at least 72 hours according to Table 552-5. Protect concrete exposed in the final
construction for at least 7 days according to Table 552-5.
Furnish and place continuously recording surface temperature measuring devices that are accurate
within ±2 °F (±1 °C).
At the end of the protection period, allow the concrete to cool gradually over 24 hours at a rate not to
exceed the maximum values shown in Table 552-5. Remove protection when the concrete surface
temperature is within 25 °F (15 °C) of the ambient air temperature.

(b) Hot weather. Hot weather is defined as any time during the concrete placement when the ambient
temperature at the work site is above 90 °F (35 °C).
Cool surfaces that come in contact with the mix to below 90 °F (35 °C) by covering with wet burlap or
cotton mats, fog spraying with water, covering with protective housing, or by other approved methods.
During placement, maintain concrete temperature by using any combination of the following:
(1) Shade the material storage areas or production equipment;
(2) Cool aggregate by sprinkling; and
(3) Cool aggregate and water by refrigeration or replacing a portion or all of the mix water with
flaked or crushed ice to the extent that the ice completely melts during mixing of the concrete.
(c) Evaporation. When placing concrete in bridge decks or other exposed slabs, limit expected
evaporation rate to less than 0.1 pound per square foot (0.5 kilograms per square meter) per hour as
determined by Figure 552-1.
When necessary, take one or more of the following actions:
(1) Construct windbreaks or enclosures to effectively reduce the wind velocity throughout the
area of placement;
(2) Use fog sprayers upwind of the placement operation to effectively increase the relative
humidity; and
(3) Reduce the temperature of the concrete according to Subsection 552.10(b).
(d) Rain. Protect the concrete from rain during and after placement.
552.11 Handling and Placing Concrete. Perform the work under Section 208, except for work under
Section 258. Construct reinforcing steel, structural steel, bearing devices, joint material, and miscellaneous
items according to the appropriate Sections.

403

Section 552

(a) General. Design and construct falsework and forms according to Section 562. Remove mortar,
debris, and foreign material from the forms and reinforcing steel. Do not place concrete until the
forms, embedded material, and the adequacy of the foundation material have been inspected.
Thoroughly moisten the forms and subgrade immediately before concrete is placed against them. Use
an approved form release agent to produce a minimum of staining, air holes, and hydration
discoloration.
Handle, place, and consolidate concrete by methods that do not cause segregation and will result in
dense homogeneous concrete that is free of voids and rock pockets. Do not displace reinforcing steel or
other material that is to be embedded in the concrete during concrete placement. Do not retemper
concrete by adding water to the mix. Use temporary form spreader devices until concrete placement
precludes their need.

To use this chart:
1. Enter with air
temperature, move
up to relative
humidity.
2. Move right to

temperature.
3. Move down to

Evaporation Rate of Surface Moisture
Note: Example shown by dashed lines is for an air temperature of 65 °F
(18 °C), relative humidity of 45 percent, concrete temperature of 65 °F
(18 °C), and a wind velocity of 15 miles (24 kilometers) per hour. This
results in a rate of evaporation of 0.13 pounds per square foot
(0.63 kilograms per square meter) per hour.
404

Section 552

Place concrete continuously without interruption between planned construction or expansion joints.
Control the delivery rate, placing sequence, and construction methods to ensure fresh concrete is
always placed and consolidated against previously placed pre-initial set concrete. Do not allow time
between the placement of successive batches to exceed 30 minutes.
Do not damage previously placed concrete or break the bond between the concrete and reinforcing
steel. Keep workers off fresh concrete. Do not support platforms for workers and equipment directly
on reinforcing steel. Once the concrete is set, do not disturb the forms or reinforcing bars that project
from the concrete until it is of sufficient strength to resist damage.
(b) Sequence of placement.
(1) Substructures. Do not place loads on finished bents, piers, or abutments until concrete
cylinder tests from the same concrete cured under the same conditions as the substructure
element indicate that the concrete has at least 80 percent of its required 28-day compressive
strength.
(2) Vertical members. For vertical members less than 15 feet (4.5 meters) in height, allow the
concrete to set for at least 30 minutes before placing integral horizontal members. For vertical
members over 15 feet (4.5 meters) in height, allow the concrete to set for at least 12 hours. Do
not transfer loads from horizontal members until the concrete has reached the specified strength
and has been in place at least 7 days.
Do not mount friction collars or falsework brackets on vertical members until the concrete has
cured for at least 7 days or has reached specified strength.
(3) Superstructures. Place concrete in the superstructure only after the substructure forms are
stripped to allow inspection of the supporting concrete.
For concrete placed in T-beams or deck girders with depths greater than 48 inches
(1200 millimeters), allow 5 days cure time for the stem concrete before placement of the top or
deck slab.
For box girders, place the bottom slab and stems in one or separate placements. Do not place the
top slab until the stems have 5 days cure time.
(4) Arches. Place concrete for arches in alternate lateral sections to minimize shrinkage stresses.
Take into account deflections of the arch centering. Place other sections symmetrically with
respect to the center of the bridge span. Where wide barrel arches require a longitudinal joint,
place concrete on each side of such joint independently of the centering to avoid relative
settlements. Bond the sections together with suitable keys or dowels.
(5) Box culverts. Place the box culvert base slab and allow 24 hours before the remainder of the
culvert is constructed.
(6) Precast elements. Place and consolidate concrete so that shrinkage cracks are not produced
in the member.
(c) Placing methods. Use equipment of sufficient capacity that is designed and operated to prevent
mix segregation and mortar loss. Do not use equipment that causes vibrations that could damage the
freshly-placed concrete. Do not use equipment with aluminum parts that come in contact with the
concrete. Remove set or dried mortar from inside surfaces of placing equipment.
405

Section 552

Place concrete as near as possible to its final position. Consolidate concrete in horizontal layers greater
than 18 inches (450 millimeters) thick. Do not exceed the vibrator capacity to consolidate and merge
the new layer with the previous layer. Do not place concrete at a rate that exceeds the design loading of
the forms.
Do not drop unconfined concrete more than 5 feet (1.5 meters). Concrete may be confined by using a
tube fitted with a hopper head or other approved device that prevents mix segregation and mortar
spattering. This does not apply to cast-in-place piling or drilled shaft when concrete placement is
completed before initial set occurs in the bottom of the piling.
Operate concrete pumps so that a continuous stream of concrete without air pockets is delivered at the
tube discharge.
(d) Consolidation. Provide sufficient hand-held internal concrete vibrators or mechanical vibrator
gangs suitable for the conditions of concrete placement. Use vibrators conforming to Table 552-6.
Provide rubber-coated vibrators when epoxy-coated reinforcement is used.
Provide a spare vibrator at the site in case of breakdown. Use external form vibrators only when the
forms have been designed for external vibration and when internal vibration is not possible.

Consolidate concrete by mechanical vibration immediately after placement. Manipulate vibrators to
thoroughly work the concrete around reinforcement, embedded fixtures, corners, and angles in the
forms. Do not cause segregation. Do not consolidate concrete placed underwater. Supplement
vibration with spading, as necessary, to ensure smooth surfaces and dense concrete along form
surfaces, in corners, and at locations impossible to reach with the vibrators.
Vibrate the concrete at the point of deposit and at uniformly spaced points not farther apart than one
and one-half times the radius over which the vibration is visibly effective. Insert vibrators so that the
affected vibrated areas overlap. Do not use vibrators to move concrete. Insert vibrators vertically and
slowly withdraw from the concrete. Vibrate with sufficient duration and intensity to thoroughly
consolidate the concrete, but not to cause segregation. Do not vibrate at one point long enough to cause
localized areas of grout to form. Do not vibrate reinforcement.
(e) Underwater placement. Underwater placement of concrete is permitted only for concrete mixtures
designed for underwater placement according to Subsection 552.03. Use tremies, concrete pumps, or
other approved methods for placement.

406

Section 552

(1) Tremies. Use watertight tremies, with a sufficient to ensure that aggregate-induced blockages
will not occur Use multiple tremies as required. Make tremies capable of being rapidly lowered
to retard or stop the flow of concrete.
Seal the discharge end and fill the tremie tube with concrete at the start of concrete placement.
Keep the tremie tube full of concrete to the bottom during placement. If water enters the tube,
withdraw the tremie and reseal the discharge end. Maintain continuous concrete flow until the
placement is completed.
(2) Concrete pumps. Use pumps with a device at the end of the discharge tube to seal out water
while the tube is first being filled with concrete. When concrete flow is started, keep the end of
the discharge tube full of concrete and below the surface of the deposited concrete until
placement has been completed.
Place underwater concrete continuously from start to finish in a dense mass. Place each succeeding
layer of concrete before the preceding layer has taken initial set using more than one tremie or pump if
necessary. Keep the concrete surface as horizontal as practical. Do not disturb after placement.
Maintain still water at the point of deposit.
Dewater after test specimens cured under similar conditions indicate that the concrete has sufficient
strength to resist the expected loads. Remove laitance or other unsatisfactory material from the
exposed concrete.
(f) Concrete railings and parapets. Use smooth, tight-fitting, rigid forms. Neatly miter corners. Place
concrete railings and parapets after the falsework for the supporting span is released. Remove forms
without damaging the concrete. Finish corners to be true, clean-cut, and without cracks, spalls, or other
defects.
Cast precast railing members in mortar-tight forms. Remove precast members from molds as soon as
the concrete has sufficient strength to be self-supporting. Protect edges and corners from chipping,
cracking, and other damage. Cure according to Subsection 552.15(b). The curing period may be
shortened when approved; use moist heat, Type III portland cement, or water reducing agents.
552.12 Construction Joints. Provide construction joints at locations shown in the plans. Obtain approval
for additional construction joints.
Extend reinforcing steel uninterrupted through construction joints. Embed lap splices or mechanical
splices within the concrete. Do not use dowels. At horizontal construction joints, place gauge strips inside
the forms along exposed faces to produce straight joint lines.
When the joint is between fresh and newly hardened concrete, rough float the first placement to
thoroughly consolidate the surface and leave the surface in a roughened condition. Clean the joint surface
of laitance, curing compound, and other foreign material. Use an abrasive blast or other approved method
to expose the aggregate on the joint surface. Re-tighten forms where the joint overlaps the first placement.
Immediately before placing new concrete, flush the joint surface with water and allow it to dry to a surface
dry condition.
When the joint is between existing concrete and a new placement, abrasive blast clean or use other
approved methods to remove laitance and foreign material, to expose clean aggregate, and to roughen the
joint surface. Before concrete placement, apply approved bonding products to the joint surface according
to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
407

Section 552

552.13 Expansion and Contraction Joints.
(a) Open joints. Form open joints with a wooden strip, metal plate, or other approved material.
Remove the joint forming material without chipping or breaking the corners of the concrete. Do not
extend reinforcement across an open joint.
(b) Filled joints. Cut pre-molded expansion joint filler to the shape and size of the surface being
jointed. Secure the joint filler on one surface of the joint using galvanized nails or other acceptable
means. Splice according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After form removal, remove and
neatly cut concrete or mortar that has sealed across the joint. Fill joint gaps ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) or
wider with approved filler. Place necessary dowels, load transfer devices, and other devices as shown
in the plans or as directed.
(c) Steel joints. Fabricate plates, angles, or other structural shapes accurately to conform to the
concrete surface. Set joint opening to conform to the ambient temperature at the time of concrete
placement. Securely fasten the joints to keep them in correct position. Maintain an unobstructed joint
opening during concrete placement.
(d) Compression joint seals. Use one-piece compression joint seals for transverse joints and the
longest practical length for longitudinal joints. Clean and dry joints and remove spalls and
irregularities. Apply a lubricant adhesive as a covering film to both sides of the seal immediately
before installation. Compress the seal and place it in the joint as recommended by the manufacturer.
Make sure the seal is in full contact with the joint walls throughout its length.
Remove and discard seals that are twisted, curled, nicked or improperly formed. Remove and reinstall
joint seals that elongate more than 5 percent of their original length when compressed. Remove excess
lubricant-adhesive before it dries.
(e) Elastomeric expansion joint seal. Install the joint according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations and according to the plans.
552.14 Finishing Plastic Concrete. Strike off concrete surfaces that are not placed against forms. Float
finish the concrete surface. Remove laitance or thin grout. Carefully tool non-chamfered edges with an
edger. Leave edges of joint filler exposed.
Protect the surface from rain damage.
Provide at least two non-sagging and non-vibrating work bridges capable of supporting the workers and
equipment during placement, finishing, and curing operations. Place the work bridges at a reasonable
height above the concrete surface to not impede worker performance and not touch the finished or fresh
concrete surface.
(a) Striking off and floating. For bridge decks or top slabs of structures serving as finished
pavements, use an approved power driven finishing machine equipped with a screed that oscillates in a
transverse direction. Use hand-finishing methods for irregular areas when approved.
Strike off surfaces. Do not support rails within the limits of the concrete placement without approval.

408

Section 552

Set rails or headers on non-yielding supports so the finishing equipment operates without interruption
over entire surface being finished. Extend rails beyond both ends of the scheduled concrete placement
a sufficient distance to enable finishing machine to finish the concrete being placed.
Set rails the entire length of continuous girder structures before placing deck concrete.
Adjust rails, headers, and strike-off equipment to the required profile and cross-section allowing for
anticipated settlement, camber, and deflection of falsework.
Before beginning delivery and placement of concrete, operate the finishing machine over the entire
area to be finished to check for excessive rail deflections, deck thickness, reinforcing steel cover, and
to verify proper operation of equipment. Make necessary corrections before concrete placement
begins.
After placing the concrete, operate finishing machine over the concrete as needed to obtain the
required profile and cross-section. Keep a slight roll of excess concrete in front of the cutting edge of
the screed at all times. Maintain this excess of concrete to the end of the pour or form and then remove
and waste it. Adjust rails or headers as necessary to correct for unanticipated settlement or deflection.
Remove rail supports embedded in the concrete to at least 2 inches (50 millimeters) below the finished
surface. Clean the voids of dust and debris using compressed air or other means. Apply approved
bonding material in the voids. Fill the voids with fresh concrete of the same type and property as
previously placed. Finish the surface with a float, roller or other approved device as necessary to
remove local irregularities.
Remove excess water, laitance, or foreign material brought to the surface using a squeegee or
straightedge drawn from the center of the slab towards either edge. Do not apply water to the surface
of the concrete during finishing operations.
(b) Straightedging. Check slab and sidewalk surfaces. Check the entire surface parallel to the
centerline of the bridge with a 10-foot (3-meter) metal straightedge. Overlap the straightedge at least
half the length of the previous straightedge placement.
Correct deviations in excess of ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) from the testing edge of the straightedge. For
deck surfaces that are to receive an overlay, correct deviations in excess of ¼ inch (6 millimeters).
(c) Texturing. Finish after floating or at a time when finishing operations will not displace aggregate.
Produce a skid-resistant surface texture on driving surfaces by grooving. Use one of the following or a
combination finishes for other surfaces as required.
(1) Grooved finish. Use a float having a single row of fins or an approved machine designed
specifically for sawing grooves in concrete pavements. Space fins ½ to ¾ inch (13 to
20 millimeters) on centers. Make the grooves 1⁄16 to 3⁄16 inch (2 to 5 millimeters) wide and ⅛ to
3
⁄16 inch (3 to 5 millimeters) deep. Groove perpendicular to the centerline without tearing the
concrete surface or loosening surface aggregate.
If grooves are sawn, cut the grooves approximately ¼ inch (6 millimeters) wide at a spacing of
½ to 1 inch (13 to 25 millimeters).
On bridge decks, discontinue grooving 12 inches (300 millimeters) from curb face and provide a
longitudinal troweled finish on the surface of gutters.
409

Section 552

(2) Sidewalk finish. Strike off the surface using a strike board and then float the surface. Use an
edging tool on edges and expansion joints. Broom the surface using a broom with stiff bristles,
broom perpendicular to the centerline from edge to edge with adjacent strokes slightly
overlapped. Produce regular corrugations not over ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) in depth without
tearing the concrete. Correct porous spots, irregularities, depressions, small pockets, and rough
spots while the concrete is plastic. Groove contraction joints at the required interval using an
approved grooving tool.
(3) Troweled and brushed finish. Use a steel trowel to produce a slick, smooth surface free of
bleed water. Brush the surface with a fine brush using parallel strokes.
(4) Exposed aggregate finish. Strike off the surface using a strike board and then float the
surface. Use an edging tool on transverse and longitudinal joints that are against forms or
existing pavement. Do not edge transverse joints in a continuous lane pour or longitudinal joints
in a continuous dual lane pour.
Broom the surface as soon as the concrete hardens sufficiently to prevent particles of gravel from
being dislodged. Use stiff brushes approved by the CO. Exercise care to prevent marring of the
surface and cracking or chipping of slab edges or joints. Apply a light spray of retardant to the
unfinished surface to facilitate this work if approved.
Broom transversely across the pavement. Pull the loosened semi-stiff mortar off the pavement.
Remove the mortar from adjacent pavements. Then broom parallel to the pavement centerline.
Continue this operation until a sufficient quantity of coarse aggregate is exposed. Other methods
of aggregate exposure, such as using a water spray attachment on a special exposed aggregate
broom, will be permitted if satisfactory results are demonstrated.
After curing according to Subsection 552.15(b) or (c), wash the surface with water and brush to
remove laitance and cement from the exposed coarse aggregate.
(d) Surface underneath bearings. Finish bearing surfaces to within ⅛ inch (5 millimeters) of plan
elevation.
When a masonry plate is to be set:
(1) Directly on the concrete or on filler material less than ⅛ inch (5 millimeters) thick; finish the
surface with a float to an elevation slightly above plan elevation. Grind the surface as necessary to
provide a full and even bearing after the concrete has set.
(2) On filler material between ¼ and ½ inch (6 to 13 millimeters) thick; finish the surface with a
steel trowel. Finish or grind the surface so that it does not vary from a straightedge in any direction
by more than ¼ inch (6 millimeters).
(3) On filler material greater than ½ inch (13 millimeters) thick or when an elastomeric bearing pad
is to be used; finish the surface to a plane surface free of ridges.
When required under a masonry plate or elastomeric bearing pad, use nonshrink grout. Proprietary
products may be used with approval.
(e) Surface underneath waterproofing membrane deck seal. Finish to a smooth surface, free of
ridges and other projections.

410

Section 552

552.15 Curing Concrete. Begin curing immediately after the free surface water has evaporated and the
finishing is complete. If the surface of the concrete begins to dry before the selected cure method can be
implemented, keep concrete surface moist using a fog spray without damaging the surface.
Keep surfaces to be rubbed moist after forms are removed. Cure immediately following the first rub.
Cure the top surfaces of bridge decks using the liquid membrane curing compound method combined with
the water method. Apply liquid membrane curing compound immediately after finishing. Apply the water
cure within 4 hours after finishing.
Cure concrete uninterrupted for at least 7 days. If pozzolans in excess of 10 percent by mass of the
hydraulic cement is used in the mix, cure uninterrupted for at least 10 days.
(a) Forms in-place method. For formed surfaces, leave the forms in-place without loosening. If forms
are removed during the curing period to facilitate rubbing, only strip forms from those areas able to be
rubbed during the same shift. During rubbing, keep the surface of the exposed concrete moist. After
the rubbing is complete, continue curing process using the water method for the remainder of the
curing period.
(b) Water method. Keep the concrete surface continuously wet by ponding, spraying, or covering
with material that is kept continuously and thoroughly wet. Covering material may consist of cotton
mats, multiple layers of burlap, or other approved material that does not discolor or otherwise damage
the concrete.
Cover the covering material with a waterproof sheet material that prevents moisture loss from the
concrete. Use the widest sheets practical. Lap adjacent sheets at least 6 inches (150 millimeters), and
tightly seal seams with pressure sensitive tape, mastic, glue, or other approved methods. Secure
material so that wind does not displace it. Immediately repair sheets that are broken or damaged.
(c) Liquid membrane curing compound method. Do not use the liquid membrane method on
surfaces to receive a rubbed finish. Use on construction joint surfaces is permitted only if the
compound is removed by sandblasting before placement of concrete against the joint.
Only use Type 2, white-pigmented liquid membrane on the top surfaces of bridge decks or on surfaces
not exposed to view in the completed work. Use Type 1-D clear curing compounds on other surfaces
and on colored concrete.
Mix membrane curing solutions containing pigments before use. Continue to agitate during
application. Use equipment capable of producing a fine spray. Apply the curing compound at a
minimum rate of 1 gallon per 150 square feet (0.25 liters per square meter) in one or two uniform
applications. If the solution is applied in 2 applications, follow the first application with the second
application within 30 minutes, and apply at right angles to the first application.
Immediately apply a new coat over the damaged areas if the membrane is damaged by rain or other
means during the curing period.
552.16 Finishing Formed Concrete Surfaces. Remove and replace or repair, as approved, rock pockets
or honeycombed concrete. Finish sound, formed concrete surfaces as follows:

411

Section 552

(a) Class 1 – Ordinary surface finish. Finish the following surfaces with a Class 1, ordinary surface
finish:
(1) Under surfaces of slab spans, box girders, filled spandrel arch spans, and the roadway deck
slab between superstructure girders;
(2) Inside vertical surface or T-girders of superstructures; and
(3) Surfaces to be buried and culvert surfaces above finished ground that are not visible from the
traveled way or a walkway.
Begin finishing as soon as the forms are removed. Remove fins and irregular projections from surfaces
that are exposed or will be waterproofed. Remove bulges and offsets with carborundum stones or
discs. Remove localized, poorly-bonded rock pockets or honeycombed concrete, and replace with
sound concrete or packed mortar in an approved manner.
Clean and point form tie cavities, holes, broken corners and edges, and other defects. Saturate the area
with water. Finish the area with mortar that is less than 1-hour old. After the mortar is set, rub it (if
required) and continue curing. Match exposed surfaces to surrounding concrete.
Carefully tool and remove free mortar and concrete from construction and expansion joints. Leave
joint filler exposed for its full length with clean, true edges.
Rub or grind bearing surfaces on piers and abutments to the specified elevation and slope.
If the final finished surface is not true and uniform, rub it according to Subsection 552.16(b).
(b) Class 2 – Rubbed finish. Finish the following surfaces with a Class 2, rubbed finish:
(1) Surfaces of bridge superstructures, except those surfaces designated to receive a Class 1 or
other finish;
(2) Surfaces of bridge piers, piles, columns and abutments, and retaining walls above finished
ground and to at least 12 inches (300 millimeters) below finished ground;
(3) Surfaces of open spandrel arch rings, spandrel columns and abutment towers;
(4) Surfaces of pedestrian undercrossings, except floors and surfaces to be covered with earth;
(5) Surfaces above finished ground of culvert headwalls and endwalls when visible from the
traveled way or walkway;
(6) Inside surfaces of culvert barrels higher than 48 inches (1200 millimeter) that are visible from
the traveled way. Finish for a distance inside the barrel at least equal to the height of the culvert;
and
(7) Surfaces of railings.
Complete a Class 1 finish according to Subsection 552.16(a). Saturate the concrete surface with water.
Rub the surface with a medium coarse carborundum stone using a small quantity of mortar on its face.
Use mortar composed of cement and fine sand mixed in the same proportions as the concrete being
finished. Continue rubbing until form marks, projections, and irregularities are removed and a uniform
surface is obtained. Leave the paste produced by this rubbing in place.
412

Section 552

After other work which could affect the surface is complete; rub with a fine carborundum stone, and
water until the entire surface has a smooth texture and uniform color. After the surface has dried; rub it
with burlap to remove loose powder. Leave the surface without unsound patches, paste, powder, and
objectionable marks.
(c) Class 3 – Tooled finish. Do not use mortar blocks or wires to set reinforcing steel near the formed
surface of areas to receive a tooled finish. Complete a Class 1 finish according to Subsection
552.16(a). Let the concrete set for at least 14 days or longer if necessary to prevent the aggregate
particles from being picked out of the surface. Use air tools (such as a bush hammer, pick, or crandall).
Chip away the surface mortar, and break the aggregate particles to expose a grouping of broken
aggregate particles in a matrix of mortar. Produce a tooled finish on a small test area for approval
before proceeding. Adjust the work procedures to produce a satisfactory finish and use those same
procedures to finish the designated area.
(d) Class 4 – Sandblasted finish. Complete a Class 1 finish according to Subsection 552.16(a). Let
the concrete cure for at least 14 days. Protect adjacent surfaces that are not to be sandblasted. Sandblast
a small test area for approval before proceeding. Use hard, sharp sand to produce an even fine-grained
surface in which the mortar is cut away leaving the aggregate exposed. Do not remove mortar beyond
one-third the diameter of the coarse aggregate.
(e) Class 5 – Wire brushed or scrubbed finish. Complete a Class 1 finish according to Subsection
552.16(a). Begin as soon as the forms are removed. Scrub the surface with stiff wire or fiber brushes
using a solution of muriatic acid. Mix the solution in the proportion of 1 part acid to 4 parts water.
Scrub until the cement film or surface is completely removed and the aggregate particles are exposed.
Leave an evenly pebbled texture having the appearance of fine granite to coarse conglomerate
depending upon the size and grading of aggregate. Wash the entire surface with water containing a
small quantity of ammonia.
(f) Class 6 – Color finish. Build a sufficient number of 24- by 48-inch (600- by 1200-millimeter)
concrete color sample panels to obtain a color acceptable to the CO. Protect the approved color sample
panel. Color designated surfaces to match the color of the approved sample.
Complete a Class 1 finish according to Subsection 552.16(a). Do not apply the color finish until
concrete placement for the structure is complete. Remove dust, foreign matter, form oil, grease, and
curing compound with a 5 percent solution of trisodium phosphate and then rinse the concrete surface
with clean water.
Use paper, cloth, or other means to protect surfaces not to be color finished. Apply the finish to a dry
concrete surface when the surface temperature is 40 °F (4 °C) or higher and the air temperature in the
shade is anticipated to be 40 °F (4 °C) or higher during the 24 hours following application.
Apply the color finish according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Spray, brush, or roll on the
first coat of penetrating sealer and color base. Spray, brush, or roll on the finish coat after the first coat
has thoroughly dried. Apply finish to provide a uniform, permanent color, without runs and sags to the
surfaces.
Clean concrete areas not intended to be covered by the finish using an approved method.

552.17 Concrete Anchorage Devices. Use chemical, grouted, or cast-in-place concrete anchorage devices
for attaching equipment or fixtures to concrete.
Furnish the following for approval:
(a) Concrete anchorage device sample;
(b) Manufacturer’s installation instructions; and
(c) Material data and certifications.
Fabricate metal parts of the anchorage devices from stainless steel or from steel protected with a corrosion
resistant metallic coating that does not react chemically with concrete. Supply anchorage devices complete
with hardware.
For chemical or grouted anchors, conduct a system approval test on one anchor on the project, not to be
incorporated in the work. Conduct a static load test according to ASTM E488. Demonstrate that the
anchorage device can withstand a sustained direct tension test load not less than the values shown in Table
552-7 for at least 48 hours with movement not to exceed 1⁄32 inch (1 millimeter). Also demonstrate that
when loaded to failure, the anchor device demonstrates a ductile failure of the anchor steel, not a failure of
the chemical, grout, or concrete.

552.18 Loads on New Concrete Structures. Do not allow traffic on concrete bridge decks until deck
concrete has attained the design compressive strength and has been in place 14 days or longer.
Construction loads less than 4000 pounds (1800 kilograms) may be placed on the deck 7 days after the
concrete is placed and the concrete in the entire span has attained a compressive strength of at least
70 percent of the specified design strength.
For precast concrete multi-beam sections, do not allow vehicles on any span until the grout has attained a
strength of 3,000 pounds per square inch (21 megapascals) and tie rods have been tightened.
For post-tensioned concrete structures, do not allow vehicles over 4,500 pounds (2000 kilograms) on any
span until the prestressing steel for that span is tensioned, grouted, and cured, the grout has obtained a
strength of 3,000 pounds per square inch (21 megapascals), and the tie rods are tightened. Vehicles
weighing less than 4,500 pounds (2000 kilograms) may be permitted on a span provided the mass of the
vehicle was included in the falsework design.
552.19 Concrete Repair. For concrete repairs, remove existing or new defective concrete according to
Subsection 203.04(b) and (c). After removal of deteriorated or unsound concrete, shotblast exposed
structural steel, reinforcing steel, and concrete surfaces which will be in contact with repair material
until free of rust and foreign material. Clean the sound concrete surface by flushing with clean water
from a high pressure water jet or compressed air. Remove and replace deteriorated reinforcing steel.
Before placing repair concrete, thoroughly flushing with clean water under pressure or compressed air.
If compressed air is used, provide a filter in airline to ensure that the air is oil-free. If there is an interval
of more than 24 hours between cleaning of the sound concrete surfaces that have been contaminated by
substances detrimental to good bonding, clean by abrasive shot blasting and pressurized water flushing
or remove the concrete.
For vertical and overhead concrete repairs and those horizontal repairs to areas less than 5 inches
(130 millimeters) in depth; use a non-shrink grout patching compound placed according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
For other repairs patches greater than 5 inches (130 millimeters) in depth, apply a bonding coat of a epoxy
resin adhesive to the surfaces of the sound existing concrete immediately before placing new concrete
against it. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for the epoxy resin adhesive. Repair areas using
Class A(AE) concrete.

553.05 Prestressing Steel. Use prestressing steel that is bright and free of corrosion, dirt, grease, wax,
scale, rust, oil, or other foreign material that may prevent bond between the steel and the concrete. Do not
use prestressing steel that has sustained physical damage or is pitted.
One splice per strand is permitted when single strand jacking is used. When multi-strand jacking is used,
splice all the strands or no more than 10 percent of the strands. Use strands having similar properties, from
the same source, and having the same "twist" or "lay". Locate splices outside the casting bed and between
members.
Do not weld or ground welding equipment on forms or other steel in the member after the prestressing
steel is installed.
Failure of one wire in a 7-wire prestressing strand is acceptable if 85 percent of the required tension load is
attained before failure and if the failed strand does not constitute more than 2 percent of the total area of
strands in an individual beam or girder.

strength of the bars.
Protect prestressing steel against physical damage, rust, or corrosion. Do not use damaged prestressing
steel.
Package prestressing steel to protect it from physical damage and corrosion during shipping and storage.
Place a corrosion inhibitor in the package. Use a corrosion inhibitor that has no deleterious effect on the
steel, concrete, or bond strength of steel to concrete. Replace or restore damaged packaging.
Mark the shipping package with a statement that the package contains high-strength prestressing steel and
a warning to use care in handling. Identify the type, kind, and quantity of corrosion inhibitor used,
including the date when placed, safety regulations, and instructions for use. Assign a lot number and tag
for identification purposes to wire, strand, anchorage assemblies, or bars shipped to the site.
553.06 Concrete. Construct prestressed concrete according to Section 552. Construct reinforcing steel
according to Section 554.
420

Section 553

Make at least one set release strength test cylinders according to AASHTO T 23 in addition to those
required to determine the 28-day compressive strength. Cure the release strength test cylinders with the
concrete member they represent.
Rough cast the top surface of members against which concrete will be cast. Finish surfaces to be covered
with a waterproofing membrane deck seal to a smooth surface free of ridges and other projections.
Cure the girder in a saturated atmosphere of at least 90 percent relative humidity. Cure time may be
shortened by heating the outside of impervious forms with radiant heat, convection heat, conducted steam,
or hot air.
Apply radiant heat by pipes circulating steam, hot oil, hot water, or electric heating elements. Inspect
casting beds to ensure uniform heat application. Use a suitable enclosure to contain the heat. Minimize
moisture loss by covering exposed concrete surfaces with plastic sheeting or liquid membrane curing
compound according to Subsection 552.15. Sandblast curing compound from surfaces to which concrete
will be bonded.
Envelop the entire surface with saturated steam. Completely enclose the casting bed with a suitable type of
housing, tightly constructed to prevent the escape of steam and exclude outside air. Use steam at
100 percent relative humidity. Do not apply the steam directly to the concrete.
With hot air, the CO will approve the method to envelop and maintain the girder in a saturated atmosphere.
Do not allow dry heat to touch the girder surface.
With heat curing methods:
(a) Keep unformed girder surfaces in a saturated atmosphere throughout the curing time.
(b) Embed a thermocouple, linked with a thermometer accurate to ±5 °F (±3 °C), 6 to 8 inches (150 to
200 millimeters) from the top or bottom of the girder on its centerline and near its midpoint.
(c) Monitor with a recording sensor, accurate to ±5 °F (±3 °C), arranged and calibrated to continuously
record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle.
(d) Make the temperature record available to the CO.
(e) Heat concrete to no more than 100 °F (38 °C) during the first 2 hours after placing concrete, and
increase the temperature no more than 40 °F (22 °C) per hour to a maximum of 160 °F (71 °C).
(f) Cool concrete, after curing is complete, no more than 40 °F (22 °C) per hour until a temperature
20 °F (11 °C) above the temperature of the air to which the concrete will be exposed has been reached.
(g) Keep the temperature of the concrete above 60 °F until the girder reaches release strength.
Cure precast, prestressed members to the release compressive strength. This is when the average strength
of two representative test cylinders is greater than the minimum required strength and the individual
strength of any one cylinder is no more than 5 percent below the required strength.
553.07 Tensioning. Use hydraulic jacks to tension prestressing steel. Use a pressure gauge or load cell for
measuring jacking force.
421

Section 553

Calibrate measuring devices at least once every 6 months or if they appear to be giving erratic results.
Calibrate the jack and gauge as a unit with the cylinder extension in the approximate position that it will be
at final jacking force. Keep a certified calibration chart with each gauge.
If a pressure gauge is used, do not gauge loads less than ¼ nor more than ¾ of the total graduated capacity
of the gauge, unless calibration data clearly establishes consistent accuracy over a wider range. Use a
pressure gauge with an accurate reading dial at least 6 inches (150 millimeters) in diameter.
Measure the force induced in the prestressing steel using calibrated jacking gauges, load cells, or a
calibrated dynamometer. Take elongation measurements of the prestressing steel. Determine the required
elongation from average load-elongation curves for the prestressing tendons used.
For pre-tensioned members, if there is a discrepancy between the gauge pressure and elongation of more
than 5 percent in tendons over 50 feet (15 meters) in length or 7 percent in tendons of 50 feet (15 meters)
or less in length determine the source of error before proceeding. Do not allow discrepancies in
post-tensioned members to exceed 7 percent.
If the jacking system is equipped with an automatic release valve that closes when the required
prestressing force is reached, strand elongation measurements are only required for the first and last tendon
tensioned and for at least 10 percent of the remaining tendons.
If a load cell is used, do not use the lower 10 percent of the manufacturer’s rated capacity of the load cell
to determine the jacking force.
Do not exceed a temporary tensile stress of 80 percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength
of the prestressing steel. Anchor prestressing steel at an initial stress that will result in the retention of a
working stress after all losses of not less than those required.
For pre-tensioned members, do not allow the initial release stress after seating, and before other losses, to
exceed 70 percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel for
stress-relieved strands and 75 percent for low-relaxation strands. For post-tensioned members, do not
allow the initial release stress after seating to exceed 70 percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile
strength of the prestressing steel.
553.08 Pre-tensioned Members. Cast pre-tensioned members to the tolerances shown in Table 553-1.
(a) Prestressing steel. Protect prestressing steel placed in the stressing bed from contamination and
corrosion if the stressing bed is to be exposed to weather for more than 36 hours before encasement in
concrete.
Free strands of kinks or twists. Accurately hold prestressing steel in position and tension according to
Subsection 553.06. Do not allow strands to unwind more than one turn. Keep a record of the jacking
force and elongation measurements after the strands are tensioned to 20 percent of final jacking force.
Tension prestressing steel to the required stress. Include in elongation computations strand anchorage
slippage, splice slippage, in place horizontal movement of the structural member during prestressing
operations, and prestressing steel temperature changes between the time of tensioning and the time
when the concrete takes its initial set. Computations must be prepared by a professional engineer.

422

Section 553

Maintain the prestress bed forms, strands, and reinforcement bar temperature within 25 °F (14 °C) of
the temperature of the concrete to be placed in the forms. Support strands with rollers at points of
direction change when strands are tensioned in a draped position. Use free-running rollers with
minimal friction. Initially, when strands are tensioned and then pulled into the draped position, tension
to no more than the required tension minus the increased tension due to forcing the strand to a draped
profile. If the load in a draped strand at the dead end, as determined by elongation measurements, is
less than 95 percent of the jack load, tension the strand from both ends of the bed. Make the load, as
computed from the sum of elongations produced by jacking at both ends, agree within 5 percent of the
jack load.
Within 3 hours before placing concrete, check the tension on the prestressing strands. The method and
equipment for checking the loss of prestress will be approved by the CO. If strands are tensioned
individually, check each strand for loss of prestress. Retension to the original computed jacking stress
for strands that show a loss of prestress in excess of 3 percent. If strands are tensioned in a group,
check the entire group for total loss of prestress. Release and retension the entire group if the total
prestress shows a loss in excess of 3 percent or if individual strands appears significantly different
from the rest of the strands in the group.
(b) Releasing steel. Release the prestress load to the concrete after the concrete has attained its
required release compressive strength. Do not expose the concrete to temperatures below freezing for
at least 7 days after casting. Cut or release strands such that lateral eccentricity of the prestress force is
minimized. Cut off prestressing steel flush with the end of the member, except as noted in the plans.
(c) Debonding strands. Use solid or split plastic sheathing with a minimum thickness of 1/32 inches
(0.8 millimeters) to debond strands. Before placing concrete, use tape to thoroughly seal split and solid
sheathing including ends to prevent the migration of concrete mortar along the strand.
553.09 Storing, Transporting, and Erecting. Do not ship prestressed concrete members until concrete
cylinder tests, manufactured of the same concrete and cured under the same conditions as the members;
indicate that the concrete in each member has attained the minimum required design strength and is at least
7 days old, except decked Bulb-T sections must be at least 10 days old.
Before transporting prestressed concrete members, provide written certification from a professional
engineer conforming to the qualifications of Subsection 553.03, that the members were fabricated and
visually inspected according to the contract and meet minimum quality requirements.
Store, transport, and erect precast, prestressed girders, slab units, and box units in the upright position with
the points of support and directions of the reactions, with respect to the member, approximately the same
as when the member is in its final position. Prevent cracking or damage during hoisting, handling, and
storing of the precast units. Replace units damaged by improper handling or storing.
553.10 Post-Tensioned Members. Construct post-tensioned members to the tolerances shown in Table
553-1. Construct supporting falsework so that the superstructure is free to lift off the falsework and shorten
during post-tensioning. Detail formwork left inside box girders to support the roadway slab to offer
minimum resistance to girder shortening due to shrinkage and post-tensioning.
(a) Ducts. Use mortar-tight ducts that are sufficiently-rigid to maintain their shape and alignment
during concrete placement and grout installation. Use ducts conforming to the following minimum
wall thicknesses:
423

Section 553

(1) Metal duct, 2⅝ inch (65 millimeter) diameter

26 gage (0.55 millimeter)

(2) Metal duct, > 2⅝ inches (> 65 millimeter) diameter

24 gage (0.70 millimeter)

(3) High density polyethylene (HPDE)

14 gage (2.0 millimeter)

(4) High density polypropylene (HDPP)

14 gage (2.0 millimeter)

(5) Metal duct with bar tendons preassembled
with duct

31 gage (0.25millimeter)

For tendons composed of single prestressing bars, provide ducts with a minimum internal duct
diameter of at least ¼ inch (6 millimeters) larger than the outside diameter of the prestressing bar. For
multiple wire, bar, or strand tendons, provide a duct nominal internal cross-sectional area of at least
two and one-quarter times the net area of the prestressing steel. When tendons are to be placed by the
pull through method, provide a duct nominal internal cross-sectional area of at least two and one-half
times the net area of the prestressing steel.
Make positive joints between duct sections. Do not make angles at the joints. Use waterproof tape at
the joints. Bend ducts without crimping or flattening. Use ferrous metal or polyethylene couplings to
connect ducts to anchoring devices.
Protect ducts against crushing, excessive bending, dirt contamination, and corrosive elements during
transport, handling, and storing.
In case of duct damage, seal duct with tape, or splice a duct coupler over the damaged section to form
a seal that prevents cement paste from entering the duct during the placement of concrete and to
prevent leakage during grouting operations.
Provide ducts and anchorage assemblies with inlets for the injection of grout into the duct after
prestressing according to the PTI, Guide Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures.
Provide ducts with outlets to allow the escape of air, water, grout, and bleed water according to the
PTI, Guide Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures.
Provide inlets and outlets with an inner diameter of at least ¾ inch (19 millimeters) for strand tendons
and of at least ½ inch (13 millimeters) for single bar tendons. Extend the length of outlets a sufficient
distance out of the concrete member to allow for the proper closing of the outlets.
Place inlets and outlets, at a minimum, in the following locations:
• Anchorage area of the tendon;
• High points of the duct, when the vertical distance between the highest and lowest point is
more than 24 inches (600 millimeters);
• Inlet at or near the lowest point of the tendon;
• Outlet at low points of the duct;
• Major changes in the cross-section of the duct, such as couplers and anchorages; and
• Outlet at a distance less than 36 inches (900 millimeter) downstream from high point outlets.
424

Section 553

Show inlet and outlet locations on drawings.
Provide positive mechanical shut-off valves for inlets and outlets. Provide inlets and outlets with
valves, caps, or other devices capable of withstanding the grouting pressure.
Securely fasten ducts in place to prevent movement. Maintain distances from the forms by stays,
blocks, ties, hangers, or other approved supports. Use precast mortar blocks of approved shape and
dimensions. Separate layers of ducts by mortar blocks.
Space duct supports according to the PTI, Guide Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned
Structures. Cover the ends of ducts to prevent the entry of water or debris.
Connect inlets and outlets to the duct with metallic or plastic structural fasteners. Do not use
components that react with the concrete, cause corrosion of the prestressing steel, or contain water
soluble chlorides.
(b) Placing concrete. Where the end of a post-tensioned assembly will not be covered by concrete,
recess the anchoring devices so that the ends of the prestressing steel and all parts of the anchoring
devices are at least 2 inches (50 millimeters) inside the end surface of the members.
Before placing concrete, demonstrate that ducts are unobstructed. Immediately after concrete
placement, blow out the metal conduit with compressed, oil-free air to break-up and remove mortar in
the conduit before it hardens. Approximately 24 hours after the concrete placement, flush the metal
conduits with water containing lime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) in the quantity
of 0.1 pounds per gallon (12 grams per liter). Blow the water out with compressed, oil-free air.
For post-tensioned members that are to be steam cured, do not install prestressing steel until curing is
complete.
(c) Anchorages and distribution. Give at least 10 days notice before installing end fittings or heading
wires.
When wires are used, provide an edge distance for any hole for prestressing wire through a stressing
washer, unthreaded bearing ring, or plate of at least ¼ inch (6 millimeters) from the root of any threads
or the edge of any ring, plate, or washer.
Anchor post-tensioned prestressing steel at the ends by permanent type anchoring devices capable of
developing not less than 95 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel. If the
anchoring device is sufficiently large and is used in conjunction with a steel grillage embedded in the
concrete that effectively distributes the anchor load to the concrete, the steel distribution plates or
assemblies may be omitted.
Enclose loop tendon anchorages in ducts for their entire length.
(d) Prestressing steel. Use a corrosion inhibitor to protect prestressing steel installed in ducts before
placing and curing of the concrete. Use a corrosion inhibitor that does not adversely affect the steel,
concrete, or bond strength of the steel to concrete.
If prestressing steel is installed in the ducts within 10 days after concrete curing, stressing, and
grouting are completed, no corrosion inhibitor is required.
425

Section 553

(e) Post-tensioning. Wait at least 10 days after the last concrete has been placed in the member or until
tests on concrete cylinders indicate that the concrete has attained the minimum compressive strength.
Demonstrate that the prestressing steel is free and unbonded in the duct. Straighten wires if necessary
to produce equal stress in all wires, wire groups, or parallel lay tendons that are stressed
simultaneously. Remove side forms for girders before post-tensioning.
Record gauge pressures and prestressing steel elongation at all times while tensioning prestressing
steel and submit records.
Determine the friction loss in the prestressing process (that is the difference between tension at the jack
and minimum tension in the prestressing steel) according to the AASHTO, Load and Resistance
Factor Design (LFRD) Bridge Design Specifications.
Use suitable shims or other approved devices to attain the specified anchor set loss.
(f) Grouting. Provide Class A, B, C, or D grout as specified and prestressing steel that is free of dirt,
loose rust, grease, or other deleterious material. Bond post-tensioned prestressing steel to the concrete
by filling the void space between the duct and tendon with grout according to the PTI, Guide
Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures.
Perform grouting operations using staff with grouting experience on projects of a similar type and
magnitude. Perform grouting operations under the immediate supervision of an individual skilled in
various aspects of grouting and who is certified by the American Segmental Bridge Institute (ASBI)
Grouting Certification program. Furnish the name of the grouting operations supervisor and proof of
their ASBI certification and grouting experience before beginning grouting operations.
Make available on-site before beginning grouting operations, the required testing equipment for
checking grout workability (flow-cone), temperatures, and other specified tests.
Use grouting equipment capable of continuous operation with little variation of pressure, which also
includes a system for recirculating the grout while actual grouting is not in progress. Use grouting
equipment capable of maintaining a pressure on completely grouted ducts and fitted with a valve that
can be locked off without loss of pressure in the duct.
Provide written certification that ingredients used in the grout meet the ASTM requirements contained
in the PTI, Guide Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures. This includes, but is not
limited to, the following:
(1) Cement mill test reports;
(2) Mineral additives test reports;
(3) Chemical admixtures reports; and
(4) Test reports for other ingredients used in the grout.
For prepackaged grouts, provide the manufacturer’s current certified mill test reports for the product.
Do not use compressed air to aid in the pumping of grout.

426

Section 553

Provide grout pumps of a positive displacement type, capable of providing a continuous flow of grout,
and capable of maintaining an outlet pressure of at least 150 pounds per square inch (1 megapascal)
and with a pressure gauge having a full-scale reading of not more than 300 pounds per square inch
(20 megapascals).
Grout only when the efflux time of a grout sample immediately after mixing is between 11 and
30 seconds according to ASTM C939.When hot weather conditions may cause quick setting of the
grout, cool the grout by approved methods, as necessary, to prevent blockages during pumping
operations. When freezing weather conditions are possible during and following placement of grout,
protect the grout from damage by freezing according to the PTI, Guide Specification for Grouting of
Post-Tensioned Structures.
Provide a supply of potable water and standby flushing equipment capable of developing a pumping
pressure of 250 pounds per square inch (1.7 megapascals) and of sufficient capacity to flush out
partially-grouted ducts.
Clean ducts of material that would impair bonding of the grout or interfere with grouting procedures.
Blow out each duct with compressed, oil-free air. Check inlets and outlets for their capacity to accept
injection of grout by blowing compressed, oil-free air through the system and proving each inlet and
outlet in turn.
Pass grout through a screen with ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) maximum clear openings before entering the
grout pump. Open grout vents before the start of grouting. Completely fill the duct by injecting grout
from the lowest end of the tendon in an uphill direction. Pump grout continuously through the duct and
waste at the outlet until no visible slugs of water or air are ejected, and the efflux time of ejected grout
is between 11 and 30 seconds. Maintain a continuous, one-way flow of grout within a grouting stage.
Close outlets in a similar manner one after the other in the direction of the flow. For outlets placed a
short distance downstream from a high point, close that outlet before its associated high point outlet.
Increase the grouting pressure at the injection end to at least 100 pounds per square inch
(0.7 megapascals) and hold for at least 10 seconds. Do not remove or open valves and caps until the
grout has set.
Abrasive blast clean the concrete surface of recessed anchorage assemblies. Fill anchor recesses with
concrete conforming to the requirements for the structure and finish flush.
Remove ends of vents 1 inch (25 millimeters) below the roadway surface after grouting has been
completed. Permanently seal recess areas.
Do not release the falsework under the bottom slab supporting the superstructure until at least 48 hours
after grouting of the post-tension prestressing steel or until the grout strength is obtained.

Construction Requirements

554.03 Order Lists. On reinforcing steel order lists, use the same respective bar marks for labeling as
shown in the plans. Submit order lists and bending diagrams for approval. Approval does not relieve the
Contractor of responsibility for the accuracy of the lists and diagrams. Do not order material until the lists
and diagrams are accepted.
Do not fabricate vertical reinforcement in columns, walls, piers, and shafts until footing elevations are
established in the field.
554.04 Identification. Ship bar reinforcement in standard bundles, tagged and marked according to CRSI,
Manual of Standard Practice.
554.05 Bending. Fabricate reinforcing bars according to ACI SP-66, ACI Detailing Manual. Cold bend
reinforcing bars that require bending. Limit the overall height or drop bending tolerance of deck truss bars
to plus 0 inch (0 millimeter) or minus ¼ inch (6 millimeters). Do not bend bars partially embedded in
concrete, except as shown in the plans or otherwise permitted.
Provide standard hooks conforming to ACI SP-66.
554.06 Protection of Material. Store reinforcing steel above the ground on platforms, skids, or other
supports. Protect from physical damage, rust, and other surface deterioration.
Use reinforcing steel only when the surface is clean and the minimum dimensions, cross-sectional area,
and tensile properties conform to the physical requirements for the size and grade of steel specified.
Do not use reinforcing steel that is cracked, laminated, or is covered with dirt, rust, loose scale, paint,
grease, oil, or other deleterious material.
554.07 Epoxy-Coated Reinforcing Steel. Support coated bars on padded contact areas. Pad bundled
bands. Lift with a strong back, multiple supports, or a platform bridge. Prevent bar-to-bar abrasion. Do not
drop or drag bundles.
Before placement, inspect bars for coating damage. Replace and do not use bars with a total damaged area
in any 12-inch (300-millimeter) length that exceeds 5 percent of the surface area of that length of the bar.

433

Section 554

Clean other damaged coatings by removing surface contaminants and the damaged coating. Roughen the
area around the damage and remove rust by blast cleaning or power tool cleaning. Use a prequalified
ASTM A775 patching/repair material to patch defects in the coating that are discernible to the unaided
eye. Overlap the patching material onto the original coating for 2 inches (50 millimeters) or as
recommended by the manufacturer. Provide a minimum 8 mil (200-micrometer) dry film thickness on the
patched areas.
Take necessary steps to minimize damage to the coating of installed bars. Clean and patch damage to
coatings noted after installation as described above. Promptly treat the bar according to the resin
manufacturer’s recommendations and before detrimental oxidation occurs.
Coat mechanical splices after splice installation according to ASTM A775 for patching damaged epoxy
coatings.
554.08 Placing and Fastening. Place, fasten, and support the bars according to the CRSI, Manual of
Standard Practice. Coat chairs, tie wires, and other devices used to support, position, or fasten
epoxy-coated reinforcement with a dielectric material.
Use precast concrete blocks or metal supports. Attach concrete block supports to the supported bar with
wire cast in the center of each block. Use Class 1 (plastic protected) or Class 2, Type B (stainless steel
protected) metal supports in contact with exposed concrete surfaces. Use stainless steel conforming to
ASTM A493, Type 430.
Space slab bar supports no more than 48 inches (1200 millimeters) apart transversely or longitudinally. Do
not use bar supports either directly or indirectly to support runways for concrete buggies or other similar
construction loads. Replace damaged supports.
Place bars within 1½ inches (38 millimeters) of the plan location. Do not cumulate spacing variations. Do
not allow the average of any two adjacent spaces to exceed the required spacing. Place reinforcing steel in
deck slabs within ¼ inch (6 millimeters) of the vertical plan location. Using a template, check the clear
cover over deck reinforcing steel before placing deck concrete.
Provide 2 inches (50 millimeters) clear cover for reinforcement. The tolerance on minimum concrete cover
is minus ⅜ inch (10 millimeters). For concrete surfaces cast against the ground provide a minimum
3 inches (75 millimeters) of clear cover over reinforcement.
Tie reinforcing at intersections around the perimeter of each mat and at not more than 24-inch
(600-millimeter) centers or at every intersection, whichever is greater. Tie bridge deck reinforcing bars at
not more than 12 inch (300 millimeter) or every intersection, whichever is greater.
Tie bundle bars together at intervals not exceeding 6 feet (1.8 meters). Do not bundle bars unless the
location and splice details are specified.
Do not place concrete in members until the reinforcing steel placement is approved.
554.09 Splices. Splicing, except as shown in the plans, is not permitted without approval. Provide lap
lengths shown in the plans. Splice reinforcing bars only where shown in the plans or accepted drawings.
Make lapped splices by placing the reinforcing bars in contact and wiring them together so as to maintain
the alignment and position of the bars.

LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and Clause 12 of the AASHTO/AWS, Bridge Welding Code D1.5
(D1.5M).
Remove mill scale and foreign material from exterior surfaces of exterior girders of unpainted
weathering steel by blast cleaning according to SSPC-SP6, Commercial Blast Cleaning. Then dry the
surface and apply at least three uniform applications of water mist at 24 hour intervals to ensure uniform
weathering.
Do not heat curved steel girders.
Do not drill, cut, or weld portions of structural members unless shown in the plans or approved in writing.
(a) Steel identification. Use a system of assembly-marking of individual pieces and cutting

corresponding item covered on the mill purchase order). Provide information to the shop that maintains
the identity of the original piece.
Identify material furnished from stock by heat number and mill test report.
During fabrication and before assembling members, show the specification of each piece of steel (other
than Grade 36 (250) steel). Mark steel using steel die stamping or firmly attaching a substantial tag to
pieces of steel which will be subject to fabricating operations which might obliterate paint marking
before assembling into members. These fabrication operations include blast cleaning, galvanizing,
heating for forming, or painting.
Use low-stress type steel die stamps. Avoid impressions near edges of tensile-stressed plate members.
Do not use die stamps on fracture-critical members.
Furnish an affidavit certifying the identification of steel has been maintained throughout the fabrication
operation.
(b) Plates.
(1) Rolling direction. Cut and fabricate steel plates for main members and splice plates for
flanges and main tension members, so that the primary direction of rolling is parallel to the
direction of the principal tensile and compressive stresses.
(2) Plate cut edges.
(a) Edge planing. Remove sheared edges on plates thicker than 5⁄8 inches (15 millimeters) to
a depth of ¼ inch (6 millimeters) beyond the original sheared edge or beyond re-entrant cuts
produced by shearing. Fillet re-entrant cuts before cutting.

438

Section 555

(2) Visual inspection and repair of plate cut edges. Visually inspect and repair plate cut
edges. Conform to AASHTO/AWS, Bridge Welding Code D1.5 (D1.5M).
(b) Flange plates. Furnish flange plates with either oxygen-cut edges that have ground
corners chamfered at least 1⁄16 inch (1.6 millimeters) or furnish universal mill plates.
(c) Web plates. Use oxygen cutting to provide the prescribed camber in web plates of built-up
beams and girders, box girders, and box arches. Cut sufficient extra camber into the webs to
provide for camber losses due to welding and cutting.
(d) Truss members. Prepare longitudinal edges of plates in welded sections of truss web and
chord members by oxygen cutting. Use grinding to chamfer the edges of the corners of plates
at least 1⁄16 inch (1.6 millimeters) when plates are not joined by welding.
(e) Stiffeners and connection plates. Sheared edges may be used on plate thicknesses up to
¾ inches (19 millimeters) for stiffeners and connection plates welded transverse to girder
webs and flanges. Universal mill plate may be used for plate thicknesses up to 1 inch
(25 millimeters). Furnish other stiffeners and connection plates with oxygen-cut edges.
(f) Lateral gusset plates. Bolted lateral gusset plates may be furnished with sheared edges
provided the thickness is less than or equal to ¾ inches (19 millimeters). Oxygen cut, parallel
to lines of stress, gusset plates and other connections welded parallel to lines of stress in
tension members where the plate thickness exceeds ⅜ inches (10 millimeters).
(g) Splice plates and gusset plates. Furnish with oxygen-cut edges.
(h) Bent plates. Furnish un-welded, load-carrying, rolled steel plates.
Bend plates at right angles to the direction of rolling, except cold-bent ribs for
orthotropic-deck bridges may be bent in the direction of rolling.
Before bending, round the plate corners to a radius of 1⁄16 inch (1.6 millimeters) throughout
the portion of the plate where the bending occurs.
(1) Cold bending. Do not cold-bend fracture-critical steels and fracture-critical members.
For other steels and members, cold bend according to Table 555-1 so that no plate
cracking occurs. Allow for springback of Grades 100 (690) and 100W (690W) steels
equal to about three times that for Grade 36 (250) steel. Use a lower die span of at least
sixteen times the plate thickness for break press forming.
(2) Hot bending. If a radius shorter than the minimum specified for cold bending is
required; hot bend the plates at a temperature less than 1,200 °F (650 °C), except for
Grades 70W (485W), 100 (690) and 100W (690W). When steel plates are heated to
temperatures greater than 1,100 °F (595 °C) for Grade 100 (690) and Grade 100W
(690W) or greater than 1,050 °F (565 °C) for Grade 70W (485W); re-quench and temper
according to the producing mill's standard practice and test to verify restoration of
specified properties. Do not heat Grade HPS 70W (HPS 485W) to a temperature greater
than 1,100 °F (595 °C). Re-quenching and tempering is not required for Grade HPS 70W
(HPS 485W) steel heated to this limit.

555.08 Annealing and Stress Relieving. Normalize and anneal (full annealing) according to ASTM
A941. Maintain uniform temperatures throughout the furnace during the heating and cooling so the
temperature at no two points on the member differs by more than 100 °F (55 °C).
Record each furnace charge, identify the pieces in the charge, and show the temperatures and schedule
used. Provide proper instruments including recording pyrometers for determining member temperatures.
Provide records of the treatment operation for approval.
Do not anneal or normalize HPS 100W (HPS 690W) or HPS 70W (HPS 485W) steel members without
approval. See Table 555-3 for the maximum stress relieving holding temperature for these grades.
Stress relieve members (such as bridge shoes, pedestals, or other parts that are built-up by welding sections
of plate together) according to Subsection 4.4 of AASHTO/AWS, Bridge Welding Code D1.5 (D1.5M).
555.09 Bolt Holes. Punch or drill bolt holes. If required below, either subpunch or subdrill holes 3⁄16 inch
(5 millimeters) smaller than the nominal bolt diameter and after assembling ream or drill full size.
(a) Punched holes. Unless subpunching and reaming is required by Subsection 555.09(h); punch
material forming parts of a member with no more than 5 metal thicknesses if the material thickness is
no greater than:
(1) ¾ inch (19 millimeters) for structural steel;
(2) ⅝ inch (15 millimeters) for high-strength steel; or
(3) ½ inch (13 millimeters) for quenched and tempered alloy steel.

441

Section 555

Punch holes 1⁄16 inch (1.6 millimeters) larger than the nominal bolt diameter. Ream holes that require
enlarging to admit bolts. Produce clean cut holes without torn or ragged edges.
(b) Reamed or drilled holes. Subdrill and ream or drill holes full-size where there are more than five
thicknesses or where the main material is thicker than Subsection 555.09(a)(1) thru (3).
Assemble and securely hold together connecting parts that are being reamed or drilled and match-mark
before disassembling. Where practical, use twist drills, twist reamers, or roto-broach cutters directed
by mechanical means. Ream or drill cylindrical holes 1⁄16 inch (1.6 millimeters) larger than the nominal
bolt diameter that are perpendicular to the member. Remove burrs on the outside surfaces.
(c) Accuracy of holes. Drilled or reamed holes may be up to 1⁄32 inch (0.8 millimeter) larger than the
true decimal equivalent of the nominal diameter of the drill or reamer. Punched holes may be slightly
conical. Slotted holes produced by flame-cutting or a combination of drilling, or punching and flame
cutting may be up to 1⁄32 inch (0.8 millimeter) larger than the nominal width. Grind flame cut surfaces
smooth to a maximum surface roughness of 1000 micro-inches (25 micrometers).
(d) Accuracy of hole group before reaming. Punch, subpunch, or subdrill holes to allow a cylindrical
pin 3⁄16 inch (5 millimeters) smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole can be
inserted in holes after assembling (before reaming). In addition, produce at least 75 percent of the
contiguous holes in the same plane such that a cylindrical pin ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) smaller in
diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole can be inserted perpendicular to the face of the
member without drifting.
(e) Accuracy of hole group after reaming. Use dimensioned steel templates with hardened steel
bushings in the holes. Use connection centerlines when locating templates from the milled or scribed
ends of members. Produce at least 85 percent of the holes in a contiguous group of holes with a
maximum offset of 1⁄32 inch (0.8 millimeter) between adjacent thicknesses of metal after reaming or
drilling.
(f) Numerically-controlled drilled field connections. Drill or punch full-sized bolt holes in
unassembled pieces and connections using numerically-controlled drilling or punching equipment.
(g) Holes for ribbed bolts, turned bolts, or other approved bearing-type bolts. Provide finished
holes with a driving fit.
(h) Preparation of field connections. Drill full size holes through all thicknesses of material
assembled in proper position for field connections and field splices. Do not punch full-size holes in
longitudinal main load-carrying members, transverse floor beams, or components designated as
fracture critical members. Other options include the following:
(1) Main members of trusses, arches, continuous beam spans, bents, towers (each face), plate
girders, and rigid frame connections and splice holes. Subpunch or subdrill and ream while
assembled, or drill full size to a steel template.
(2) Rolled beam stringers continuous over floor beams or cross frames. Drill full-size holes for
field splices unassembled to a steel template.
(3) Floor beam and stringer field end connection holes. Subpunch and ream while assembled, or
drill full size to a steel template.
442

Section 555

(4) Cross frames, lateral bracing components, and the corresponding holes in connection
plates between girders and cross frames or lateral components. Punch full-size holes.
Locate, position, and firmly bolt the template in place when reaming or drilling full size
field-connection holes through a steel template. Use duplicates of templates used for reaming matching
members or the opposite faces of a single member. Locate templates used for connections on like parts
or members so that the parts or members are duplicates and require no match-marking.
555.10 Pins and Rollers.
(a) Fabricating pins and rollers. Fabricate straight and smooth pins and rollers without flaws.
Forge and anneal pins and rollers or use cold-finished carbon steel shafting for diameters less than
9 inches (230 millimeters). Slowly cool forged pins to a temperature below the critical range to prevent
damage from rapid cooling. Bore a hole in the pin not less than 2 inches (50 millimeters) in diameter
full-length along the pin axis before annealing.
(b) Boring pin holes. Do not exceed the pin diameter by more than 1⁄50 inch (0.50 millimeters) for pins
5 inches (130 millimeters) or less in diameter or exceed by more than 1⁄32 inch (0.8 millimeter) for
larger pins when boring pin holes. Bore pin holes smooth, straight, at right angles with the axis of the
member, and parallel with each other. Produce the final surface using a finishing cut.
Produce a maximum variation in the distance outside-to-outside of end holes in tension members and
inside-to-inside of end holes in compression members of 1⁄32 inch (0.8 millimeter) from that specified.
Bore pin holes in built-up members after the member is assembled.
(c) Threads for bolts and pins. Conform to the ASME, B1.1 Unified Inch Screw Threads (UN and
UNR Thread Form), Class 2A for external threads and Class 2B for internal threads (ASME, B1.13M
Metric Screw Threads: M Profile, tolerance Class 6G for external threads and Class 6H for internal
threads). Provide six threads per inch (25 millimeters) for pin ends with a diameter of 1⅜ inches
(35 millimeters) or greater.
555.11 Eyebars. Provide eyebars that are straight and without twists. Limit the inclination of bars to the
plane of the truss to a 0.5 percent slope.
Locate pin holes on the centerline of the eyebar. Securely clamp eyebars that are to be placed side-by-side
in the structure in the order they are to be placed on the pin. Bore the pin holes to the finished diameter
from both ends or flame cut the pin holes at least 2 inches (50 millimeters) smaller than the finished pin
diameter.
Simultaneously cut the edges of eyebars that lie between the transverse centerline of their pin holes with
two mechanically-operated torches abreast of each other guided by a substantial template to prevent
distortion of the plates.
Use low-stress type steel die stamps to match-mark eyebars for shipment and erection. Locate stamps on
the visible edge each member when the bars are nested in place on the structure.
555.12 Assembly-Bolting. Clean metal contact surfaces. Assemble, securely pin, and draw together
member parts. Drill, ream, and bolt the assembly. If necessary, take assembly apart to remove burrs and
shavings produced by the operation.
443

Section 555

Assemble the members without twists, bends, and other deformation. Drift only enough to bring the parts
into position without enlarging holes or distorting metal.
555.13 Welded Connections. Conform to AASHTO/AWS, Bridge Welding Code D1.5 (D1.5M). Install
shear connector studs according to Chapter 7. Perform preproduction testing according to Subsection 7.7.1
and inspect installed studs according to Subsection 7.8.
555.14 Preassembly of Field Connections. Submit method and details of preassembly for approval.
Preassemble field connections of truss, arch, continuous beam, plate girder, bent, tower, and rigid frame
main members. Use preassembly methods and details consistent with approved erection procedures and
camber diagrams.
Assemble girders and beams in their cambered (no load) condition. When members are assembled with
webs vertical, support the members at intervals of 20 feet (6 meters), or two-tenths of the span length,
whichever is less. When the webs are horizontal, support intervals may be increased provided there is no
noticeable deflection between points of support.
Assemble trusses in full dead-load position unless the design of the structure provides for secondary
stresses created by the fully cambered assembly. Start assembly from a location in the structure and
proceed in one or both directions. Support trusses at each panel point. Preassemble at least
three contiguous panels. For successive assemblies, include at least one section or panel of the previous
assembly plus two or more sections or panels added at the advancing end. For structures longer than
150 feet (45 meters), make each assembly at least 150 feet (45 meters) long.
Verify the geometry of the completed structure or unit. Verify or prepare field splices.
(a) Bolted connections. Where applicable, assemble major components with milled ends of
compression members in full bearing. While assembled, ream subsized holes to the specified size.
(b) Check assembly/numerically-controlled drilling. Make a check assembly for each major
structural type of each project based on proposed order of erection, joints in bearings, special complex
points, or similar considerations. Assemble at least three contiguous shop sections. For trusses,
assemble members in at least three contiguous panels, but not less than the number of panels
associated with three contiguous chord lengths (such as the length between field splices). Other shop
assemblies are not required.
Obtain approval of each assembly before reaming holes or dismantling the assembly. Inaccurate
camber, alignment, hole alignment, milled joint fit, or other problems may require additional check
assemblies.
(c) Field-welded connections. Do not field weld connections unless specifically shown on the
drawings. Verify the fit of members (including the proper space between abutting flanges) with the
segment preassembled.
(d) Match marking. Match mark connecting parts preassembled in the shop to ensure proper fit in the
field. Provide a diagram showing match-marks.

444

Section 555

555.15 Connections Using Unfinished, Turned, or Ribbed Bolts. Use bolts conforming to ASTM A307,
Grade A with single self-locking nuts or double nuts. Use beveled washers where bearing faces have a
slope more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.
(a) Turned bolts. Furnish hex headed bolts of the nominal size specified with a body surface ANSI
roughness less than 125 micro-inches (3 micrometers). Ream holes to provide for a light driving fit.
Keep bolt threads outside of the holes. Provide a washer under the hexagonal nut.
(b) Ribbed bolts. Furnish round headed bolts conforming to ASME, B18.5 Round Head Bolts (Inch
Series) (ASME, B18.5.2.2M Bolts, Metric Round Head Short Square Neck) with continuous
longitudinal ribs. Provide a body diameter measured on a circle through the points of the ribs 5⁄64 inch
(2 millimeters) greater than the nominal diameter specified for the bolts. Furnish hexagonal nuts that
are either recessed or have a washer of suitable thickness.
Ream holes to provide for a driving fit. Ream the hole and provide an oversized replacement bolt if the
ribs compress or deform allowing the bolt to twist before drawing tight.
555.16 Connections Using High-Strength Bolts.
(a) Bolted parts. Use only steel material within the grip of the bolt with no compressible material
(such as gaskets or insulation). Fabricate steel parts to fit solidly together after bolts are stressed.
Remove burrs that prevent solid seating. Limit the slope between the bolted surface and the plane
normal to the bolt axis to 1:20.
(b) Surface conditions. Clean dirt, foreign material, and scale (except tight mill scale) from joint
surfaces at the time of assembly. Remove paint (including inadvertent overspray) from areas within the
bolt pattern. In non-coated joints, exclude or remove paint closer than 1 inch (25 millimeters) or one
bolt diameter, whichever is larger, from the edge of holes.
(c) Installation. Use fasteners of the same lot number for each connection. Protect fasteners from dirt
and moisture. Only remove the fasteners from protected storage that are to be installed and tensioned
during a work shift. Return unused fasteners to protected storage at the end of the shift. Do not remove
as-delivered lubricant from fasteners. Discard and replace fasteners for slip-critical connections that
accumulate rust or dirt before installing.
Provide a Skidmore-Wilhelm calibrator or other acceptable bolt tension measuring device. Use the
measuring device to perform the rotational-capacity test and to confirm the following:
•
•
•

Table 555-4 requirement for the complete fastener assembly;
Calibration of the wrenches if applicable; and
Understanding and proper use of the tightening method.

full size ASTM A325 and A490 bolts with UNC threads (metric coarse thread series, ANSI
B1.13M) loaded in axial tension) rounded to the nearest 1,000 pounds (1 kilonewton).

For short grip bolts, perform the calibrated wrench verification test using a direct tension indicator with
solid plates. Check the direct tension indicator with a longer grip bolt in the tension measuring device
before testing short grip bolts. Conform to Subsection 555.16(c)(3) through (6) as applicable for
confirming testing frequency, number of tests, and test procedure. Provide documentation of annual
testing by an approved testing agency confirming the accuracy of the tension measuring device. Install
fasteners with specified washers in properly aligned holes. Tension using methods in Subsection
555.16(c)(3) through (6) to the minimum tension specified in Table 555-4.
When it is impractical to turn the nut, tension the fastener by turning the bolt while preventing the nut
from rotating when approved by the CO. Provide adequate capacity and sufficient air to tension each
bolt in about 10 seconds if impact wrenches are used.
Do not reuse ASTM A490 fasteners and galvanized ASTM A325 fasteners. If approved,
non-galvanized ASTM A325 bolts may be re-used once. Touching up or re-torqueing previously
tensioned bolts (which may have been loosened by the tensioning of adjacent bolts) will not be
considered reuse provided the tensioning continues from the initial position and does not require
greater rotation than that shown in Table 555-5.

The tolerance is minus 0, plus 30° for bolts installed by one-half turn or less.
The tolerance is minus 0, plus 45° for bolts installed by two-third turn or more.
(3) Determine the required rotation by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions.

(1) Rotational-capacity tests. Use washers even if not required in the actual installation.
Perform job-site rotational-capacity tests for fastener assemblies according to ASTM A325 and
the following:
(a) Tighten the fastener to a snug-tight condition according to Subsection 555.16(c)(3). Use
the bolt tension measuring device to tighten the fastener two times the required turns shown
in Table 555-5 if impact wrenches are used.
(b) Verify the maximum recorded tension is at least 1.15 times the minimum fastener tension
shown in Table 555-4. Record the tension and torque.
(c) Verify the measured torque at the maximum recorded tension does not exceed the value
obtained by the following equation:
TorqueUSC = 0.25PD

TorqueMetric = 0.34PD

where:
Torque

= Measured torque in foot-pounds (newton-meters)

P

= Maximum recorded tension in pounds (newtons)

D

= Nominal bolt diameter in feet (meters)

(2) Washers. Conform to ASTM F436. Use a hardened beveled washer where the outer face of
the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.

447

Section 555

Use hardened square or rectangular beveled washers for American Standard Beams and
Channels.
If necessary, clip washers on one side to within seven-eighths times the bolt diameter measured
from the washer center.
Hardened washers are not required for connections using ASTM A325 and ASTM A490 bolts,
except under the following conditions:
(a) Use a hardened washer under the turned element when the tensioning is done by the
calibrated wrench method.
(b) Use a hardened washer under both the head and the nut when A 490 bolts are installed in
material having a specified yield point less than 40 kips per square inch (275 megapascals).
(c) Use a hardened washer conforming to ASTM F436 where ASTM A325 bolts of any
diameter or ASTM A490 bolts equal to or less than 1-inch (M24) diameter are installed in
oversize or short-slotted holes in an outer ply.
(d) Use 5⁄16-inch (8-millimeter) minimum thickness hardened washers conforming to
ASTM F436 under both the head and the nut instead of standard thickness hardened washers
where ASTM A490 bolts larger than 1-inch (M24) diameter are installed in oversize or short
slotted holes in an outer ply. Do not use multiple hardened washers with a combined
thickness equal to or greater than 5⁄16 inch (8 millimeters) to satisfy this requirement.
(e) Use a 5⁄16-inch (8-millimeter) minimum thickness plate washer or continuous bar where
ASTM A325 bolts of any diameter or ASTM A490 bolts equal to or less than 1-inch (M24)
diameter are installed in a long-slotted hole in an outer ply. Provide a structural grade steel
bar or plate washer (that need not be hardened) with standard holes and of sufficient size to
cover the slot.
(f) Use a 5⁄16-inch (8-millimeter) minimum thickness hardened washer conforming to
ASTM F436 under both the head and the nut instead of washers or bars of structural grade
material where ASTM A490 bolts larger than 1-inch (M24) diameter are installed in longslotted holes in an outer ply. Do not use multiple hardened washers with a combined
thickness equal to or greater than 5⁄16 inch (8 millimeters) to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate design fasteners that provide a bearing circle on the head or nut of at least the diameter
of an ASTM F436 hardened washer may be used without washers.
(3) Turn-of-nut installation method. Install bolts in connection holes and pull the plies to firm
contact throughout the connection. Tighten bolts snug-tight beginning with the most rigid part of
the connection and proceeding to the free edges. Verify that plies are in firm contact throughout
the connection.
Apply the rotation shown in Table 555-5 beginning with bolts in most rigid part of the
connection and proceeding to the free edges. Do not allow rotation of the fastener part not turned
by the wrench.
Use a bolt tension-measuring device at the start of work to verify that the tension on at least three
fastener assemblies for each bolt diameter, length, and grade is at least 5 percent greater than the
tension shown in Table 555-4. Periodically test other fastener assemblies when required by the
CO.
448

Section 555

(4) Calibrated wrench installation method. Install bolts with hardened washers under the
turned element and pull the plies to firm contact throughout the connection. Tighten bolts
snug-tight beginning with the most rigid part of the connection and proceeding to the free edges.
Set a calibrated wrench to deliver the torque required to produce a bolt tension at least 5 percent
greater than the tension shown in Table 555-4. Use the calibrated wrench to tension bolts
beginning with the most rigid part of the connection and proceeding to the free edges. Touch up
previously tensioned bolts until bolts are tensioned to the prescribed amount.
Use a bolt tension-measuring devise at least once each shift to verify the tension on the fastener
assemblies installed. Test at least three fastener assemblies of each bolt diameter, length, and
grade installed in that shift. Recalibrate a wrench when the prescribed tension is not achieved or
when a significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts, threads, nuts, or
washers. When tightening from a snug-tight condition, verify that the wrench adjustment
selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation greater than permitted in
Table 555-5. Torque nuts in the tightening direction when measuring the torque using manual
torque wrenches.
(5) Direct tension indicator (DTI) installation method. Use DTIs conforming to ASTM F959
and installed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Position the DTI under the
stationary element or place a hardened washer between the DTI and the turned element.
Install bolts with DTIs and required hardened washers and pull the plies to firm contact
throughout the connection while holding the stationary element against rotation. Remove and
replace all DTIs where the number of spaces in which a 0.005 inches (0.125 millimeters) feeler
gage is refused in the DTI exceeds the number listed in the AASHTO, LRFD Bridge
Construction Specifications table.
For uncoated DTIs used under a stationary or turned element and for coated (galvanized, painted,
or epoxy-coated) DTIs used under a stationary element, further tension the bolts until the number
of refusals of the 0.005 inches (0.125 millimeters) feeler gage is equal to or greater than the
number listed in the AASHTO, LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications table. Remove and
replace bolts that are tensioned so that no visible gap remains. For coated DTIs used under a
turned element, further tension the bolts until all spaces verify that the 0.005 inches (0.125
millimeters) feeler gage shows refusal in all spaces.
Verify the tension in a calibrated bolt-tension measuring device. Use a special flat insert in place
of the normal bolt head holding insert. Perform three verification tests for each combination of
fastener assembly rotational-capacity lot, DTI lot, and DTI position relative to the turned element
(bolt head or nut) to be used on the project. Install the fastener assembly in the
tension-measuring device with the DTI located in the same position as in the work. Restrain the
element intended to be stationary (bolt or nut) from rotation. Conduct verification tests in two
stages according to AASHTO, LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications table.
(6) Alternate design bolt installation method. When approved, furnish alternate fasteners that
meet the material, manufacturing, and chemical composition requirements of ASTM A325 or
ASTM A490 and:
(a) Meet the mechanical property requirements of the same specification in full-size tests,
and

449

Section 555

(b) Have body diameter and bearing areas under the head and nut; or their equivalent, not
less than those provided by a bolt and nut of the same nominal dimension.
Install alternate design bolts in connection holes according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations and pull the plies to firm contact throughout the connection. Tighten bolts
snug-tight without yielding or fracturing the control or indicator element of the fastener.
Further tension fasteners beginning with bolts in most rigid part of the connection and
proceeding to the free edges. Proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than a single cycle
of systematic partial tensioning. Replace individual fastener assemblies if yielding or fracture
occurs before the final tensioning cycle.
Verify the tension according to Subsection 555.16(c)(3), (4), or (5).
(7) Inspection. Inspect the tensioned fasteners in the presence of the CO. Replace or re-tension
loose or relaxed fasteners. Cutting with a torch is not permitted for removal of fasteners.
(a) Non-threaded fasteners. Ping each fastener with a hammer to test for soundness.
(b) Threaded fasteners. Use an inspection torque wrench to verify tensioning unless alternate
fasteners or DTI devices are used allowing verification by other methods.
Calibrate the inspection torque wrench at least once each inspection day. Individually place
three fastener assemblies of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection in a
device calibrated to measure bolt tension. Use a washer under the part turned in tightening
each bolt if washers are used on the structure. Use the same material that abuts the part
turned in the tension measuring device as used on the structure if washers are not used on the
structure. In the calibration device, tighten each bolt to the specified tension. Apply the
inspecting wrench to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or
head 5 degrees, approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch (25 millimeters at a 300-millimeter) radius,
in the tightening direction. Use the average of the torque required for all three bolts as the
job-inspection torque.
Randomly select 10 percent (at least two) of the tensioned bolts on the structure in each
connection represented by the test bolts. Apply the job-inspection torque to each selected bolt
with the inspecting wrench turned in the tensioning direction. If this torque turns no bolt head
or nut, the fastener is properly tensioned. If the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts,
apply the job-inspection torque to all bolts in the connection. Re-torque and re-inspect
fasteners whose head or nut turns.
555.17 Welding. Conform to AASHTO/AWS, Bridge Welding Code D1.5 (D1.5M) for welding, welder
qualifications, prequalification of weld details, and inspection of welds. For tubular connections, conform
to AWS, Structural Welding Code – Steel, D1.1 (D1.1M) Section 2, Part D.
Do not weld or tack brackets, clips, shipping devices, or other non-required material to members unless
shown on the drawings.
555.18 Erection. Conform to Section 562 for falsework and forms. Use steel erectors certified under the
AISC quality certification program.
(a) Handling and storing material. Place stored material on skids above ground. Keep material clean
and properly drained. Place and shore girders and beams upright. Support long members (such as
columns and chords) on skids placed close enough together to prevent deflection damage.
450

Section 555

(b) Bearings and anchorages. Furnish and install bridge bearings according to Section 564. Verify
substructure concrete built under a previous contract was properly constructed before ordering material
for the superstructure.
(c) Erection procedures.
(1) Conformance to drawings. Erect according to approved drawings. Submit revised drawings
and verification of stresses and geometry for modifications to or deviations from the approved
erection procedure for approval.
(2) Erection stresses. Allow for erection stresses locked in the structure as a result of erection
methods or equipment that differ from those previously approved. Provide additional material
necessary to keep both temporary and final stresses within the allowable limits used in the
design.
Provide temporary bracing or stiffening devices to accommodate handling stresses in individual
members or segments.
(3) Maintaining alignment and camber. Support structural segments to produce the proper
alignment and camber in the completed structure. Install cross frames and diagonal bracing
during erection to provide stability and ensure correct geometry. Provide temporary bracing at
any stage of erection.
(d) Field assembly. Clean bearing surfaces and permanent contact surfaces. Assemble material as
shown on the drawings and match-marks. Do not hammer, damage, or distort members.
Assemble splices and field connections with at least half the holes filled with fitting-up bolts and
cylindrical erection pins before installing and tightening the balance of the high-strength bolts. Use
fitting-up bolts that are the same high-strength bolts used in the installation or other bolts of the same
nominal diameter. Use cylindrical erection pins with a diameter 1/32 inch (0.8 millimeter) larger than
the bolts. Fill at least a quarter of the holes with fitting-up bolts and at least another quarter with
erection pins. Place pins in the corner holes of the splice plates. Fill at least three-fourths of the holes
of splices and connections carrying traffic.
Systematically remove fitting-up bolts and cylindrical erection pins and replace them with tightened
high-strength bolts. Start from the most rigid part of connection and proceed to the free edges.
Release temporary erection supports at a splice or connection only after bolts are installed and
tightened. Show special assembly and support situations on the erection drawings.
(e) Pin connections. Use pilot and driving nuts when driving pins. Drive pins so that the members
fully bear on the pins. Screw pin nuts tight and burr the threads at the face of the nut with a pointed
tool.
(f) Misfits. Correct minor misfits using small amounts of reaming, cutting, grinding, and chipping.
Remove and replace members misfit due to shop fabrication error or deformation during handling or
transporting.
555.19 Acceptance. Material (except bearing devices and painting) for steel structures will be evaluated

or piles. Secure caps with drift bolts extending at least 9 inches (230 millimeters) into the approximate
center of each post or pile.
557.12 Bracing. Bolt the ends of bracing through the pile, post, cap, or sill. Brace intermediate
intersections with posts or piles with bolts and spikes with wire, or boat spikes as required. Use galvanized
spikes in addition to bolts.
Make bracing bear firmly against the pile or cap to which it is bolted. Provide and place shims as
necessary to prevent bending of the bracing more than 1 inch (25 millimeters) out of true when bracing
bolts are tightened.
Where the space between the bracing and cap or pile is:
(a) Less than 1 inch (25 millimeters), shims are not needed;
(b) 1½±½ inches (38±13 millimeters), place two ogee washers with their narrow faces together or
other approved washers on each bolt that passes through the space; or
(c) Over 2 inches (50 millimeters), use wooden shims of the proper thickness.
Fabricate the wooden shims from the same treated wood used in the structure or white oak. Do not use
built-up wooden shims. Make wooden shims from a single piece of lumber with the width not less than
4 inches (100 millimeters) and the length not less than the width of the bracing measured along the cap or
pile. Do not adze, trim, or cut treated members to avoid the use of shims.
557.13 Stringers. Size stringers at bearings. Position stringers so knots near edges are in the top portion of
the stringer.

have full length bearing on a floor beam or cap. Stagger joints where stringers are two panels in length.
Separate lapped ends of untreated stringers by at least ½ inch (13 millimeters) for air circulation. Use drift
bolts to securely fasten the lapped ends.
Place cross-bridging at the center of each span. Cut cross-bridging members to provide full bearing on the
stinger sides at each end. Securely toenail the cross-bridging with at least two nails in each end. If blocking
is used, make it fit snugly and securely.
557.14 Plank Floors. Use plank that is surfaced on four sides (S4S).
Single-ply timber floors consist of a single thickness of planks supported on stringers. Grade plank
thickness so no two adjacent planks vary in thickness by more than ⅛ inch (3 millimeters). Lay the planks
heart side down with ¼ inch (6 millimeters) space between them for dry, seasoned material and with no
joint space for unseasoned material. Spike each plank securely to each stringer.
Two-ply timber floors consist of two layers of flooring supported on stringers. Treat the lower layer
according to Subsection 557.06. Lay the top layer either diagonally or parallel to the roadway centerline.
458

Section 557

560.06 Concrete Removal. Remove concrete as follows:
(a) Shallow concrete removal for deck scarification. If a hydrodemolition machine is used for
concrete scarification in preparation for a deck overlay, clean the deck by an approved method of
water blasting with 7000 pounds per square inch (335 kilopascals) minimum pressure until sound
concrete is exposed. Scarify to the depth shown in the plans. If no depth is shown, remove at least
¼ inch (6 millimeters) of material.
(b) Concrete cover removal. For planned removal of concrete or removal of unsound or
deteriorated concrete, remove concrete to the depth shown in the plans or down to sound concrete.
Provide at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) below the bottom of the exposed reinforcing steel. When
removing unsound concrete be careful to remove only to the depth that sound concrete is
encountered provided it meets the at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) below the bottom of the
reinforcing steel. Do not damage remaining sound concrete or reinforcing steel. When the bond
between existing concrete and reinforcing steel is destroyed, remove the concrete adjacent to the
reinforcing steel to a depth that permits new concrete to bond to the reinforcing steel.
Remove loose and unsound concrete resulting from the hydrodemolition operations below the
minimum depth.
Verify concrete removal as necessary or at least every 30 feet (9 meters) along the cutting path.

468

Section 560

In areas inaccessible to the hydrodemolition equipment, use approved hand-held water blasting
equipment or power-driven hand tools (such as jack hammers, mechanical chipping tools, or chipping
hammers). Do use jack hammers heavier than nominal 30 pound (14 kilogram) class and chipping
hammers heavier than 15 pound (7 kilogram) class. Operate mechanically driven tools at a maximum
angle of 45 degrees from the concrete surface.
If necessary, use hand tools (such as hammers and chisels) to remove the final particles of concrete to
achieve the required depth. Leave a rough surface after the concrete is removed.
Immediately remove residue, water, dust, and concrete to prevent rebonding to the surface or reinforcing
steel.
560.07 Reinforcing Steel. Do not cut or damage reinforcing steel designated to remain. Use methods
acceptable to the CO to repair or replace reinforcing steel damaged by operations.
Inspect the reinforcement with the CO after the concrete has been removed. Replace reinforcing steel by
tying new reinforcing steel to the existing reinforcing steel when more than 10 percent of its section is
lost. If the deteriorated portion of the reinforcing steel is closer to the edge of the patch than the overlap
distance designated in the plans, extend the limits of the patch to provide the required overlap distance
with acceptable reinforcing steel. Provide a minimum 2-inch (50-millimeter) clearance between the ends
of new reinforcing steel and the existing slab face. Match the number, type, and spacing of the new
reinforcement steel to the existing reinforcing steel.
560.08 Surface Preparation. Before placing new concrete, clean the concrete surface and exposed
reinforcing steel of rust, loose and rebounded material, and other contaminants that may inhibit bonding
with new concrete. If compressed air is used, provide a filter in the air line to ensure that the air
delivered is oil-free. Protect the steel and surface from contamination until the new concrete is placed.
560.09 Acceptance. Removal of concrete by hydrodemolition will be evaluated under Subsection

capable of sensing back pressure behind each valve. Adjust the discharge pressure to 200 pounds per
square inch (1380 kilopascals) for both epoxy components. Simultaneously discharge both epoxy
components into separate calibrated containers. Compare the discharged quantities to determine the
mix ratio.
After the test is completed at 200 pounds per square inch (1380 kilopascals) discharge pressure,
repeat the procedures for 0 pounds per square inch (0 kilopascals) discharge pressure.
(b) Pressure check test. Disconnect the mixing head of the injection equipment. Attach the two
adhesive component delivery lines to a pressure check device having two independent valved
nozzles capable of controlling the flow rate and pressure by opening or closing the valves. Use a
pressure gauge capable of sensing the pressure build-up behind each valve. Close the valves on the
pressure-check device and operate the equipment until the gauge pressure on each line reads
200 pounds per square inch (1380 kilopascals). Stop the pumps and check that the gauge pressure
does not drop below 190 pounds per square inch (1310 kilopascals) within 3 minutes.
(c) Records. Maintain and make available complete and accurate records of the ratio and pressure
check tests. Additional ratio and pressure check tests may be required.
561.05 Coring. Take one 2-inch (50-millimenter) diameter test core according to AASHTO T 24 for
every 50 feet (15 meters) of repaired crack at designated locations. The crack repair is acceptable when
the epoxy bonding has penetrated at least 90 percent of the crack volume within the core sample.
When a test core is unacceptable, redo that 50-foot (15-meter) crack segment or the segment that the
core represents and resample. Repeat this procedure until acceptable crack repair is achieved.
561.06 Finishing. Remove the surface seal and fill sample core holes with polymer concrete and mortar.
Finish the face of the crack, the entry ports, and the core holes flush with the adjacent surface and finish
the surface to match the adjacent concrete.
561.07 Traffic Control. Provide traffic control beginning with the application of epoxy paste surface
seal. Continue providing traffic control for 6 hours after completion of the crack injection work or until
the injected epoxy resin adhesive has reached a compressive strength of at least 1,450 pounds per square
inch (10 megapascals), whichever is less.
Provide traffic control to slow traffic to a maximum speed of 15 miles (25 kilometers) per hour.
For bridge deck repairs, stage traffic so that the edge of the nearest travel lane is no closer than the
center of the adjacent girder, unless specified in the contract.
561.08 Acceptance. See Table 561-1 for sampling, testing, and acceptance requirements.
Material for structural concrete injection and crack repair will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02

Section 562. — TEMPORARY WORKS
Description
562.01 This work consists of the design, construction, inspection, maintenance and removal of temporary
works for the construction and repair of permanent structures. This work also includes temporary facilities
used in construction that do not become part of the permanent structure.
Material
562.02 Select material consistent with the safety and quality required by the design assumptions.
Furnish factory fabricated components of vertical shoring towers according to FHWA-RD-93-033,
Certification Program for Bridge Temporary Works.
Design Requirements
562.03 Design. Design temporary works that will support loads imposed and provide the necessary
rigidity to produce the lines and grades shown in the plans for the final structure. Design temporary works
according to the AASHTO, Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications or
AASHTO, Guide Design Specifications for Bridge Temporary Works. Ensure the design load on
manufactured devices is within the load rating recommended by the manufacturer.
Design falsework and forms that support deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges to ensure no
differential settlement between the girders and the deck forms during placement of deck concrete.
Limit the calculated deflections of falsework and formwork members for cast-in-place concrete structures
as follows:
(a) Falsework member vertical deflection: 1⁄360 of the span under the dead load of the concrete only,
regardless of the fact that deflection may be compensated for by camber strips;
(b) Formwork (other than sheathing): 1⁄360 of the span under the dead load of the concrete only or
the lateral pressure of fluid concrete only; and
(c) Formwork (sheathing): ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) or 1⁄270 of the center-to-center distance between
studs, joists, form stiffeners, form fasteners, or wales.
Design falsework and forms for concrete supported on steel structures to ensure loads are applied to girder
webs within 6 inches (150 millimeters) of a flange or stiffener. Distribute the loads in a manner that does
not produce local distortion of the web. Brace or tie exterior girders, upon which overhanging bridge deck
falsework brackets are hung, to the adjacent interior girders as necessary to prevent rotation of exterior
girders or overstressing the exterior girder web.
Submit foundation design calculations and other relevant foundation design data for approval.
Do not use deck overhang form brackets that require holes to be cast or drilled into the bridge girders.

474

Section 562

Do not apply loads to existing, new, or partially completed structures in excess of the load carrying
capacity of any part of the structure as determined according to AASHTO, LRFD Bridge Design
Specifications.
Do not use permanent or stay-in-place deck forms unless specified.
562.04 Drawings. Submit drawings according to Subsection 104.03. Furnish design calculations and
supporting data in sufficient detail to permit a structural and safety review of the proposed design. Show
information to allow the design of components to be checked independently. Provide catalog or equivalent
data indicating a manufactured device’s recommended safe load capacity.
Indicate the proposed sequence, rate of placement, direction of placement, and location of construction
joints when concrete placement is involved. Show anticipated total settlements and deflections of the
falsework and forms. Include falsework footing settlements, joint take-up, and deflection of beams or
girders.
Submit the erection procedure and temporary support system for steel girder erection. Include calculations
in sufficient detail to substantiate that the girder geometry is correct. Provide supporting calculations
showing the falsework design accommodates the erection procedure without over stressing the structural
steel and produces the required final structural geometry, intended continuity, and structural action.
Construction Requirements
562.05 Foundations. Determine the allowable bearing capacity of the foundation material on which the
supports for temporary works will rest. Perform load tests to verify proposed bearing capacity values that
are in doubt, marginal or in other high risk situations.
Specified foundation support values for the permanent structure may be used in the design of falsework
foundations provided foundations are at the same elevation and on the same soil as those of the permanent
structure. If temporary works are to be supported on temporary fill, construct the fill according to Section
204 and verify the bearing capacity of the placed material.
Do not locate the edge of footings closer than 12 inches (300 millimeters) from the intersection of the
bench and the top of the slope. Do not locate the edge of the footings closer than 48 inches
(1200 millimeters) or the depth of excavation, whichever is greater from the edge of excavation, unless
shoring adequately supports the footing excavation.
Provide adequate site drainage and erosion control protection to ensure the integrity of the foundation
material for the temporary works supports.
If piles are used, capacities may be estimated and later confirmed during construction using standard
procedures based on the driving characteristics of the pile. Use the dynamic formula according to Section
551 to determine ultimate pile capacity in the absence of more sophisticated methods of determining pile
capacity. The Contractor may use load tests to confirm the estimated capacities. Perform load tests to
verify proposed bearing capacity values that are in doubt, marginal, or in other high risk situations.
562.06 Construction. Construct temporary works according to the approved drawings and the AASHTO,
Construction Handbook for Bridge Temporary Works. Use material and workmanship consistent with that
assumed in the design of the temporary works.

475

Section 562

Do not weld or use driven devices to fasten temporary works to portions of the permanent structure unless
shown on the approved drawings.
Furnish and place form panels for exposed surfaces in uniform widths of not less than 36 inches
(900 millimeters) and in uniform lengths of not less than 6 feet (1.8 meters), except where the width of the
member formed is less than 36 inches (900 millimeters). Arrange panels in symmetrical patterns
conforming to the general lines of the structure. Place panels for vertical surfaces with the long dimension
horizontal and with horizontal joints level and continuous. Place panels with the long dimension parallel to
the footing for walls with sloping footings and that do not abut other walls. Align form panels on each side
of the panel joint by supports or fasteners common to both panels.
Devices may be cast into the concrete for later use in supporting forms or for lifting precast members. Do
not use driven devices for fastening forms or form supports to concrete. Use form ties consisting of form
bolts, clamps, or other devices necessary to prevent spreading of the forms during concrete placement. Do
not use form ties consisting of twisted wire loops.
Make the angle points for chords in wall stems fall at vertical rustication joints when architectural
treatment is required. Form exposed curved surfaces to follow the shape of the curve, except on retaining
walls that follow a horizontal curve. The wall stems may be a series of short chords if all of the following
apply:
(a) Chords within the panel are the same length;
(b) Chords do not vary from a true curve by more than ½ inch (13 millimeters) at any point; and
(c) All panel points are on the true curve.
Provide tell-tales with surveyed measurements, or other acceptable means, for accurate measurement of
falsework settlement. Do not use the ground surface near falsework supports as a reference elevation.
Record settlement to the nearest ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) during concrete placement.
Discontinue concrete placement and take corrective action if settlement or deflections occur that deviate
more than ⅜ inch (10 millimeters) from those shown on the falsework drawings. If satisfactory corrective
action is not taken before initial set, remove unacceptable concrete.
562.07 Maintenance and Inspection. Inspect and maintain temporary works in an acceptable condition.
Clearly mark the capacity on each manufactured component according to FHWA-RD-93-033.
Perform an in-depth inspection of the temporary works in the presence of the CO not more than 24 hours
before beginning each concrete placement, or before allowing people to enter a cofferdam or excavation
support structure. Perform inspections and provide certifications according to FHWA-RD-93-033. Submit
written results of the inspections before:
(a) Placing concrete;
(b) Allowing people to enter a cofferdam or excavation support structure; or
(c) Loading temporary works.

476

Section 562

Inspect other temporary works at least once a month to ensure they are functioning properly. Use a
professional engineer to inspect cofferdams, shoring, support of excavation structures, and support systems
for load tests before loading.
Include a certification that the system meets the requirements.
562.08 Removal. Remove temporary works, except as follows:
(a) Portions of driven falsework piles that are more than 12 inches (300 millimeters) below subgrade
within roadbeds, 24 inches (600 millimeters) below the original ground or finished grade outside of
roadbeds, or 24 inches (600 millimeters) below the established limits of a navigation channel;
(b) Footing forms where their removal would damage the structural integrity of the cofferdams or
other work; and
(c) Forms from enclosed cells where access is not provided.
Remove temporary works as to permit the structure to uniformly and gradually take the stresses due to its
own dead-load.
Remove temporary works upon completion of the work unless permitted to remain. Do not disturb or
damage the finished work. Remove debris and restore the area to its original or planned condition. The
removed temporary works remain the property of the Contractor.
After the concrete has been in place for 24 hours, removal of railing and barrier forms and forms that do
not support the dead load of concrete members is permitted. Do not remove forms until the concrete has
reached at least 500 pounds per square inch (3.5 megapascals) strength and in a manner that produces no
damage to the surface. Cure concrete according to Subsection 552.15 when forms are removed less than
7 days after concrete placement.
Do not remove forms supporting the dead load of concrete members until the concrete has reached
90 percent of the design compressive strength and has been in place for at least 7 days.
Do not remove falsework supporting any span of a simple span bridge until the concrete, excluding
concrete above the bridge deck, has reached 90 percent of the design compressive strength and has been
in-place at least 10 days.
Do not remove falsework supporting any span of a continuous or rigid frame bridge until the concrete in
that span and in the adjacent portions of each adjoining span for a length equal to at least one-half the
length of the span where the falsework is to be released meets the requirements for simple span bridges.
Do not release falsework for post-tensioned portions of structures until the prestressing steel has been
tensioned.
Remove falsework for arch bridges uniformly and gradually. Begin at the crown and work toward the
springing points. Remove falsework for adjacent arch spans simultaneously.

477

Section 562

Install a reshoring system if falsework supporting the sides of girder stems with slopes steeper than 1V:1H
are removed before placing deck slab concrete. Design the reshoring system with lateral supports, which
resist rotational forces acting on the stem, including those caused by the placement of deck slab concrete.
Install the lateral supports immediately after each form panel is removed and before release of supports for
the adjacent form panel.
562.09 Acceptance. Temporary works will be evaluated under Subsections 106.02, 106.03, and 106.04.

Section 563

(b) Paint. Conform to the following:
(1) Handling and storing material. Use safe handling practices conforming to the manufacturer’s
MSDS and product data sheets. Store paint in original unopened containers with labels intact and
in weather-tight spaces where temperature is maintained between 40 and 100 °F (4 and 38 °C). Do
not open paint containers until required for application that day. Do not use paint from a punctured
container or from a container with its lid seal broken. Do not use paint with an expired shelf life.
Mix paint according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mix paint with mechanical mixers
for sufficient time to thoroughly blend the pigment and solvent together. Continue the mixing
during application. Do not thin paint that is formulated ready for application. Strain paint after
mixing, except where application equipment is provided with strainers. Use strainers of a size to
remove only skins and undesirable matter, but not to remove the pigment. Where a skin has formed
in the container, cut the skin loose from the sides of the container and remove and discard it. If the
volume of the skin is visually estimated to be more than 2 percent of the remaining paint, discard
the paint.
(2) Surface preparation and weather limitations. Thoroughly dry the surface to be painted. If no
information is provided, apply paint when:
(a) The surface temperature is between 50 and 100 ºF (10 and 40 ºC);
(b) The surface temperature is 5 ºF (3 ºC) or more above the dew point according to
ASTM D4230; and
(c) The humidity is 85 percent or less, unless specified otherwise on the manufacturer’s product
data sheets.
Provide a controlled environment to meet requirements when necessary.
(3) Application. Apply paint according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Apply paint by
brush, spray, roller, or combination of methods permitted by the manufacturer’s product data sheet.
(a) Brushes. Use brushes with sufficient bristle body and length to spread the paint in a uniform
film. Use round, oval shaped brushes, or flat brushes no wider than 4½ inches
(120 millimeters). Evenly spread and thoroughly brush out the paint as it is applied.
(b) Sprayers. Use airless or conventional spray equipment with suitable traps, filters, or
separators to exclude oil and water from the compressed air. Use compressed air that does not
show black or wet spots when tested according to ASTM D4285. Use the spray gun tip sizes
and pressures recommended by the manufacturer.
(c) Rollers. Select rollers and covers suitable for the surface and paint to be applied. Use rollers
only on flat, even surfaces. Do not use rollers that leave a stippled texture in the paint film.
Use sheepskin daubers, bottle brushes, or other acceptable methods to paint surfaces that are
inaccessible for painting by regular means.
Paint in a neat and workmanlike manner that does not produce excessive paint build-up, runs, sags,
skips, holidays, or thin areas in the paint film. Correct thin areas, skips, holidays, and other
deficiencies before the next application of paint.
Tint succeeding applications of paint to contrast with the paint being covered. Obtain color
approval for the finish coat before application.
481

Section 563

Paint surfaces that will be inaccessible after erection with the full number of undercoats required
before erection. After erection, thoroughly clean areas where the undercoating is damaged or
deteriorated, and spot coat these with the specified undercoats to the required thickness before

each product. Perform adhesion tests according to ASTM D4541 self-aligning system.
484

Section 563

Notify the CO if failure is due to adhesion (between coating and substrate or between applied
coats) or cohesion (failure within a coating layer). If failure occurs, choose a more
compatible paint system and repeat the compatibility process.
The dry paint thickness on steel structures will be determined using a Type 2 (electronic) film thickness
gauge according to SSPC-PA 2 – Measurement of Dry Coating Thickness with Magnetic Gages, an
ultrasonic coating thickness gage according to SSPC-PA 9 - Measurement of Dry Coating Thickness on
Cementitious Substrates, or by using destructive methods according to ASTM D4138. If destructive
methods are used, repair test locations in an approved manner.
563.09 Lumber and Timber. Dry timber to a moisture content of 15 percent or less.
Remove cracked or peeled paint, loose chalky paint, dirt, and other foreign material on previously painted
timber. Use wire brushing, scraping, or other approved methods.
When timber is treated with a water borne preservative, wash and brush away visible salt crystals on the
wood surface. Allow wood to dry before painting.
Remove dust or other foreign material from the surface just before painting.
Furnish a paint system shown in Table 563-3.
The primer may be applied before erection. Fill cracks, checks, nail holes, or other depressions flush with
the surface using approved putty after the primer dries and the timber is in place. Evenly spread and
thoroughly work the paint into corners and recesses. Allow the full thickness of the applied coat of paint to
dry before applying the next coat.

Specific guidance on installation of and construction plan requirements for drilled shafts can be found in
FHWA-NHI-10-016, Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and LRFD Design Methods.
565.05 Trial Drilled Shafts. When trial drilled shafts are required, perform the work according to the
applicable requirements of Subsection 565.06.
Before drilling holes for production shafts, demonstrate that the proposed methods and equipment are
adequate by drilling a trial drilled shaft adjacent to the production shafts at a location approved by the CO.
Make the center-to-center spacing between the trial shaft and production shafts at least three shaft
diameters or two bell diameters, whichever is larger.
Construct the trial drilled shaft to the same size and to the tip elevation of the deepest production shaft
shown in the plans. When bells are specified for production shafts, include a bell in the final trial shaft to
verify the feasibility of belling in the specified bearing stratum.
Install casing if caving occurs or the hole deforms sufficient to encroach upon the planned placement of
the reinforcement cage with specified minimum concrete cover. Seat the casing to prevent caving and to
allow dewatering of the hole when required. Remove material from inside the hole. Keep casing in place at
least 4 hours while attempting to remove all water in the hole. Record the rate of groundwater seepage into
the hole. After this 4 hour period, fill the hole with saturated sand while the casing is removed to simulate
the concreting operation and casing removal for the production drilled shafts.
Concrete or reinforcing steel is not required in the trial drilled shaft.
Modify methods and equipment if the trial drilled shaft does not meet performance requirements as
determined by the CO. Submit a new installation plan and drill a new trial shaft for approval.
565.06 Shaft Drilling.
(a) Drilling. Drill holes according to the approved installation plan. Excavate structural footings
supported on drilled shafts and construct fills before initiating shaft drilling.
Provide equipment and tooling with the capability to drill shafts of the specified diameter and lengths
20 percent longer than those specified. Position the drilled shaft within 3 inches (75 millimeters) of the
required position in a horizontal plane at the top-of-shaft elevation. Do not allow the constructed
alignment of a vertical shaft to vary from the required alignment by more than ¼ inch per 12 inches
(6 millimeters per 300 millimeters) of hole depth.
492

Section 565

(1) Boring log. Use a geologist or an engineer to maintain a boring log of material excavated from
the drilled shaft. Include the following information:
(a) Description and approximate top and bottom elevation of each type of soil or rock
material encountered and the date and time the soil or rock material was encountered;
(b) Elevation and approximate rate of seepage or groundwater encountered;
(c) Equipment used to drill the shaft, time required to complete the shaft, bit changes,
breakdowns, and other drilling difficulties encountered; and
(d) Remarks.
(2) Drilling methods. Use the uncased dry construction method where groundwater level and soil
conditions are suitable to construct the shaft in a relatively dry-stable excavation and may be
visually inspected before placing concrete. Use casing, wet construction method, or both for shafts
that do not meet the requirements for the dry construction method.
(a) Dry method. This method consists of drilling the shaft, removing accumulated water and
loose material from the excavation, placing the reinforcing cage, and concreting the shaft in a
relatively dry excavation.
The dry construction method can only be used when the excavation meets the following:
(1) Less than 12 inches (300 millimeters) of water accumulates above the base of the hole
during a 1-hour period when no pumping is permitted;
(2) The sides and bottom of the hole remain stable without detrimental caving, sloughing,
or swelling over a 4-hour period immediately following completion of the excavation or
over-reaming when approved by CO; and
(3) Loose material and water can be satisfactorily removed before inspection and before
reinforcement and concrete placement.
(b) Wet method. This method consists of using water or slurry to maintain shaft stability
while advancing the excavation to final depth, placing the reinforcing cage, and concreting
the shaft. In addition, perform the following:
(1) Desanding and cleaning drilling slurry;
(2) Final cleaning of the excavation using a bailing bucket, air lift, submersible pump, or
other approved devices; and
(3) Placing shaft concrete with a tremie or concrete pump, beginning at the shaft bottom.
Maintain the drilled hole to the specified nominal diameter before placing reinforcement elements and
concrete. Increase the hole diameter at least ½ inch (13 millimeters) to a maximum of 3 inches
(75 millimeters) when approved by the CO if ground softening, swelling or slurry cake buildup occurs.
Case the hole, use a slurry during drilling, or both if the drilled hole continues to degrade and encroach
upon the planned placement of the reinforcement cage with specified minimum concrete cover.
Extend exterior casings from above the waterline to a subsurface elevation to protect against water
action during placement and curing of the concrete when drilled shafts are located in open waters.
Install the exterior casing in a manner that will provide a positive seal at the bottom of the casing to
prevent piping of water or entry of other material from the shaft excavation behind the casing.
493

Section 565

Remove drill cuttings, other loose debris, or both from the bottom of the hole upon completion of
drilling. Clean the drilled hole leaving no more than ½ inch (13 millimeters) of sediment on the bottom
of the hole. Reduce the depth of accumulated water to 3 inches (75 millimeters) or less before placing
concrete in shafts constructed using the dry method.
Do not drill additional shafts, allow wheel loads, vibration-inducing equipment, or other construction
activities within 15 feet (4.5 meters) or 3 shaft diameters, whichever is greater, of a newly constructed
shaft for at least 20 hours.
Fill rejected drill holes with lean concrete.
(b) Slurry. Premix slurry with potable water according to the slurry manufacturer’s instructions to
allow for hydration before introduction into the shaft excavation. Use slurry tanks of adequate capacity
for slurry circulation, storage, and treatment. Do not use excavated slurry pits or the shaft excavation to
mix the slurry. Do not add slurry component directly into the shaft excavation.
Provide desanding equipment to limit slurry sand content as specified in Tables 565-1 and 565-2, at
any point within the shaft. Verify sand content immediately before placing concrete. Desanding is not
required for setting temporary casings, sign posts, or lighting mast foundations.
Maintain the level of slurry in the excavation at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) above the highest expected
adjacent piezometric water pressure head for mineral slurry, or 10 feet (3 meters) above the highest
expected piezometric water pressure head for polymer or water slurry.
Stop drilling and take corrective measures when there is a sudden loss of slurry from the hole. Prevent
the slurry from setting up in the shaft. Discontinue the use of slurry and use an approved alternative
method if the slurry construction method fails to produce the desired results.
Maintain density, viscosity, and pH of the mineral or polymer slurry throughout shaft excavation and
concrete placement according to Tables 565-1 and 565-2. Take slurry samples using an approved
sampling tool. Extract slurry samples from the base of the shaft and 10 feet (3 meters) up from the base
of the shaft. Perform 4 sets of tests during the first 8 hours of slurry use. The testing frequency may be
decreased to one test set for every 4 hours of slurry use when results are acceptable and consistent.

495

Section 565

(c) Casings. Install temporary casing to prevent sloughing of the top of the shaft excavation, unless it
can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the CO that surface casing is not required. Install temporary
casing regardless of excavation method when sidewall conditions warrant additional stabilization or
mitigation of excessive groundwater infiltration.
Use smooth, clean, watertight, steel casings of sufficient strength to withstand handling, installation
stresses, concrete placement, and surrounding earth pressures. Casing diameters are outside diameters
when shown in the plans. The diameter of a permanent casing is subject to American Petroleum
Institute tolerances applicable to regular steel pipe. Make the outside diameter of the casing no less
than the specified size of the shaft.
Install casings to produce a positive seal at the bottom of the shaft to prevent piping of water or other
material into or out of the excavated hole. Stabilize the excavation with slurry, backfill, or other
methods approved by the CO if it becomes necessary to remove a casing. Maintain an adequate head
of water or slurry inside the casing to prevent piping or sloughing of material at the bottom of the hole
when drilling below the water table.
Subsurface casings are to be considered temporary unless designated as permanent casing. Remove
temporary casing concurrent with concrete placement. Maintain the concrete within the casing so fluid
trapped behind the casing is displaced upward and discharged at the ground surface without
contaminating or displacing the shaft concrete.
Temporary casings that have become bound or fouled during shaft construction and cannot be
practically removed are considered to be a defect in the drilled shaft. Correct defective shafts using
methods approved by the CO. Corrective action may consist of, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) Removing the shaft concrete and extending the shaft deeper to compensate for loss of
frictional capacity in the cased zone;
(2) Providing straddle shafts to compensate for capacity loss; or
(3) Providing a replacement shaft.
Cut permanent casing off at the required elevation and leave in place
565.07 Reinforcing Steel and Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) Access Tubes Placement. Perform
reinforcing steel work according to Section 554. Securely wire together contact reinforcing steel lap
splices. Tie and support the reinforcing steel so it remains within the required tolerances. Securely tie
concrete spacers or other approved spacing devices at fifth points around the cage perimeter and space at
intervals not to exceed 10 feet (3 meters) along the length of the cage. Use spacers of approved material at
least equal in quality and durability to the shaft concrete.
Install steel CSL access tubes for each drilled shaft at locations specified and according to ASTM
D6760. Extend access tubes at least 24 inches (600 millimeters) above shaft top and a maximum of
3 inches (75 millimeters) above shaft bottom. Use 1½ inch (38 millimeters) nominal diameter Schedule
40 mild steel standard black pipe conforming to ASTM A53, any grade, Type E, Type F or Type S, for
CSL access tubes. Provide a watertight end plug at the lower end of the pipe and make joints watertight.
Fill the CSL access tubes with potable water before placing concrete in the drilled shaft. Temporarily
cap the top of the tubes to prevent debris or concrete from entering the tubes.

496

Section 565

Place the reinforcing steel cage as a unit immediately after the drilled hole is inspected, accepted, and
before concrete placement. Remove cage when directed by the CO for re-inspection if concrete is not
placed immediately. Handle reinforcing cages in a manner to avoid distortion or racking of the steel.
Provide positive support at the top for the reinforcing steel cage during concrete placement. Maintain the
top of the reinforcing steel cage no more than 6 inches (150 millimeters) above and no more than 3 inches
(75 millimeters) below the required elevation. Make acceptable corrections if the reinforcing steel cage is
not maintained within tolerances. Do not construct additional shafts until the method of reinforcing steel
cage support has been approved.
Do not proceed with installation of subsequent shafts until CSL testing has been completed on the first
drilled shaft and the results have been approved in writing by the CO. Approval to proceed with the
construction of subsequent shafts, before receiving approval of the first shaft will be based on
observations of workmanship during construction of the first shaft and the following:
(a) Contractor's conformance with the approved shaft installation plan;
(b) Contractor's daily reports and inspector's daily logs of excavation, rebar, and concrete placement;
and
(c) Concrete placement logs and volume curves.
The CO will provide written notification to proceed with subsequent shaft construction within 24 hours
after completion of the first shaft. If the CO determines the first shaft to be of questionable quality,
discontinue all shaft construction until the CSL test results of the first shaft are received and reviewed
and the shaft accepted in writing by the CO.
After the first drilled shaft has been accepted, do not change construction methods, equipment, or material
used to construct subsequent shafts, unless otherwise approved.
565.08 Concrete for Drilled Shafts. Use a removable form or other approved means to form the shaft to
at least 24 inches (600 millimeters) below finished ground when the top of shaft is above ground. Forms
may be removed provided the requirements in Subsection 562.07 are complied with and the shaft concrete
has not been exposed to saltwater or moving water for 7 days. Strip the forms without damaging the
concrete.
Remove the top portion of the drilled shaft concrete before continuing with column construction when it is
determined the concrete has been affected by underwater placement.
Place concrete immediately after excavation is complete and the reinforcing steel cage with CSL access
tubes is in place.
Furnish concrete conforming to Section 552, except:
•

Class A structural concrete having a slump of 7±1 inches (180±25 millimeters) for shafts
constructed without drilling fluid;

•

Class A structural concrete having a slump of 8±1 inches (200±25 millimeters) for shafts
constructed with drilling fluid; and

•

Class S concrete for under water placement.
497

Section 565

Do not use seal concrete above the freeze-thaw or wet-dry zone of the hole. Place underwater concrete
according to Subsection 552.11(e), except as modified in this Section. The method of underwater
placement is subject to CO approval.
Adjust approved admixtures for project conditions to ensure that the concrete has the minimum required
slump for at least 2 hours. Submit trial mix and slump loss test results for concrete at ambient temperatures
appropriate for site conditions.
Place each load of concrete within 2 hours of batching. Longer placement time may be permitted if the
concrete mix maintains the minimum required slump for longer than 2 hours. Do not retemper concrete
that has developed its initial set.
Place concrete in one continuous operation from bottom to top of the shaft.
Continue placing concrete after the shaft excavation is full and until acceptable quality concrete is evident
at the top of shaft. Consolidate the top 10 feet (3 meters) of the shaft concrete using acceptable vibratory
equipment before initial concrete set. Finish the top of the shaft to within plus 1 to minus 3 inches (plus
25 to minus 75 millimeters) of the required elevation. Do not consolidate shaft concrete until water or
slurry above the finish concrete level has been removed.
Place concrete using the following methods:
(a) Free-fall. Use free-fall placement only in dry holes. Ensure the concrete falls directly to the shaft
base without contacting either the rebar cage or shaft sidewall.
Drop chutes may be used to direct placement of free-fall concrete. Drop chutes consist of a smooth
tube of either one-piece construction or sections that can be added and removed. Support the drop
chute so that the maximum height of free-fall of the concrete measured from the bottom of the chute is
25 feet (8 meters). Reduce the height of free-fall or rate of concrete flow into the excavation if concrete
placement causes the shaft excavation to cave or slough, strikes the rebar cage or sidewall. Use tremie
or pumping to place the concrete if placement cannot be satisfactorily accomplished by free-fall
placement.
(b) Tremies. Use tremies for concrete placement in either wet or dry holes. A tremie consists of a
hopper and tube of sufficient length, mass, and diameter to discharge concrete at the shaft base. Do not
use tremies that contain aluminum parts that will come in contact with the concrete. Furnish a tremie
tube with clean and smooth inside and outside surfaces and sufficient wall thickness to prevent
crimping or sharp bends. Provide tubes with an inside diameter at least six times the maximum size of
aggregate used in the concrete mix, but not less than 10 inches (250 millimeters). Use a watertight
tremie according to Subsection 552.11(e) for wet holes. Construct the discharge end of the tremie to
permit free radial flow of concrete during placement. Place the tremie discharge at the shaft base
elevation. Place the concrete in a continuous flow. Keep the tremie discharge immersed at least 10 feet
(3 meters) below the surface of the fluid concrete. Maintain a positive head of concrete in the tremie at
all times. If the tremie discharge is removed from the fluid concrete column and discharges concrete
above the rising concrete surface into displaced water; remove the reinforcing cage and concrete,
complete necessary sidewall removal as directed, and reconstruct the shaft.
(c) Pumps. Use pumped concrete placement in either wet or dry holes. Use a 4-inch (100-millimeter)
minimum diameter discharge tube with watertight joints. Place the discharge tube at the shaft base
elevation.
498

Section 565

Use a sealed discharge tube according to Subsection 552.11(e) for wet holes. If a plug is used, remove
it from the hole or use a plug made from approved material that will prevent a defect in the shaft if not
removed.
Place the concrete in a continuous flow. Keep the pump discharge tube immersed at least 10 feet
(1.5 meters) below the surface of the fluid concrete. Remove the reinforcing cage and concrete if the
discharge tube is removed from the fluid concrete column and discharges concrete into displaced
water. Complete necessary sidewall removal as directed by the CO, and reconstruct the shaft.
565.09 Integrity Testing.
(a) Testing. Perform integrity testing on all production drilled shafts according to ASTM D6760.
Test drilled shafts between 2 and 21 days after concrete placement. Furnish drilled shaft bottom and
tip elevations, access tube lengths, surveyed tube positions, and date of concrete placement before
testing to the CSL subcontractor and the CO. Perform tests between all tube pairings in the shaft,
including adjacent perimeter access tubes and diagonally between tubes.
If an access tube is unacceptable for testing (such as tube is not plumb, tube does not retain water,
tube is obstructed, tube-concrete debonding has occurred); drill a plumb core hole to the appropriate
depth and install a fully-grouted replacement tube or propose an alternative integrity test method that
is acceptable to the CO.
Tremie fill access tubes with neat hydraulic cement grout after integrity testing, inspection and data
analysis are completed and accepted by the CO.
(b) Test results and reporting. Submit preliminary results for each shaft tested before CSL test
personnel leave the site. Submit a detailed CSL report to the CO within 5 days of testing. Allow 5 days
for the CO to conduct a review of the data before continuing construction on the tested shaft and
before issuing the final written report. Include the following in the CSL report:
(1) Project identification and dates of CSL testing;
(2) Table and a schematic showing shafts tested with identification of tube coordinates and collar
elevation;
(3) Names of personnel that performed the CSL tests and interpretations and their affiliations;
(4) Type of equipment used for testing;
(5) Data logs and waterfall diagrams;
(6) X-Y plots of first arrival times, amplitude, and velocity versus shaft depth; and
(7) Interpretations, analyses, and results.
Identify and provide detailed discussion of each anomalous zone detected by the CSL. Anomalous
zones are areas where velocity reduction exceeds 20 percent of the average velocity of properly placed
and cured shaft concrete at the time of testing. Collect and process additional data sufficient to
construct three-dimensional color-coded tomographic-images with two-dimensional cross-sections
between tubes within anomalous zones.

inclined surfaces or separate in horizontal work.

504

Section 566

566.06 Preconstruction Testing.
(a) Field trials. Conduct preconstruction shotcrete field trials before starting shotcrete production.
(1) Test panels. Prepare and cure test panels according to ASTM C1140. Construct steel or
wood test panel forms containing no reinforcement with a minimum width and length of
24 inches (600 millimeters) and a minimum depth of 6 inches (150 millimeters) with either
square or sloped sides.
When shotcrete is to be applied over reinforcement, construct additional steel or wood test panel
forms containing reinforcement with a minimum width and length of 30 inches (750 millimeters)
and a minimum depth of 3 inches (75 millimeters) with either square or sloped sides. Use
reinforcement of the same size and spacing required for the project.
Shoot test panels using the personnel, material, equipment, operating pressures, and mix designs
proposed for the project. Produce test panels for each proposed mix proportion, each anticipated
shooting orientation, and each proposed nozzle operator.
As soon after shooting and is safe to prevent damage, cover and tightly wrap the panels with
material conforming to ASTM C171 or store the panels in a moist room conforming to AASHTO
M 201.
(2) Coring. At least 14 days after shooting, drill at least three 3-inch (75-millimeters) diameter
cores from each test panel according to AASHTO T 24. Moisture condition the cores in sealed
plastic bags or nonabsorbent containers according to Section 7.3 of AASHTO T 24. Deliver
Government cores to the laboratory designated by the CO.
(3) Testing. At least 14 days, but no later than 28 days after shooting; perform and report coating
quality tests including density, boiling absorption and volume of permeable voids according to
ASTM C642. Test at least three samples from each nonreinforced test panel. Samples may consist
of cores or pieces of cores or test panels that are without observable cracks, fissures, or shattered
edges.
Before compressive strength testing, saw or tool the ends of the cores to eliminate projections and
to achieve perpendicularity to the longitudinal axis. At 28 days after shooting, conduct and report
compressive strength tests according to AASHTO T 24. Test at least three cores from each
nonreinforced test panel.
When shotcrete is applied over reinforcement, visually grade at least three cores from each
reinforced test panel according to Section 1.7 of ACI 506.2 at least 14 days, but no later than
28 days after shooting. Between 28 and 48 days, determine the maximum water-soluble
chloride-ion concentration on at least three different test panel samples according to ASTM C1218.
(4) Mix design approval. Submit the test data and results as well as a visual description of each
core to the CO. Include details concerning presence of voids, sand pockets, lamination, and other
inadequacies. Approval of the nozzle operator and mix design will be based on preconstruction
field trials and test results. The test results must meet the requirements of Table 566-1 including the
following:
(a) Compressive strength tests. Calculate the mean compressive core strength of at least three
individual, 3-inch (75-millimeter) diameter cores, taken from the same test panel. The mean of
any three consecutive core strengths must equal or exceed 0.85 f’c with no individual core less
than 0.75 f’c.
505

Section 566

(b) Coating quality tests. Calculate density, boiling absorption, and volume of permeable voids
for each test sample. No individual test may be greater than the maximum permissible values
shown in Table 566-1.
(c) Core grading tests. Calculate the mean core grade from at least three individual core grades.
The mean core grade must not be greater than the maximum permissible value shown in Table
566-1 with no individual core grade greater than 3. When a prequalification test panel is
rejected by the CO, a second panel may be shot. If the nozzle operator’s second mean core
grade is greater than 2.5, that nozzle operator is not permitted to shoot shotcrete on the project.
Core grading is performed during preconstruction testing only as a way of prequalifying nozzle
operators.
(d) Water-soluble chloride ion concentration tests. Calculate the water-soluble chloride ion
concentration for each test sample. No individual test may be greater than the maximum
permissible values shown in Table 566-1. Water-soluble chloride ion analysis is performed
during preconstruction testing only as a way of ensuring corrosion protection of the
reinforcement.
(b) Submissions. Submit field quality control test reports with the test data and results. Include the
following information in the reports:
(1) Date and time of test panel shooting including panel dimensions, size and spacing of
reinforcement, when used, and type of curing;
(2) Test panel identification including panel number, shooting orientation, mix proportions and
nozzle operator;
(3) Date, time, method of panel coring, number of test samples obtained from each panel and
sample preparation methods;
(4) Test sample identification by panel number, sample number and sample dimensions; and
(5) Date, time and types of tests performed.
566.07 Shotcrete Construction. Produce shotcrete according to ACI 506.2 and the following:
(a) Surface preparation. When shotcrete is to be placed over existing concrete or rock, remove loose
or deteriorated material from the existing surface by chipping with pneumatic or hand tools. Cut
shoulders approximately 1 inch (25 millimeters) deep along the perimeter of repair areas on existing
concrete.
Remove curing compound on previously-placed shotcrete surfaces by sandblasting or other approved
method. Maintain prepared surfaces in a clean and dry condition. Install approved depth gauges to
indicate the thickness of the shotcrete layers. Install depth gauges on 6-foot (1.8-meter) centers
longitudinally and transversely with no less than two gauges per increment of surface area to receive
the shotcrete.
Moisten surfaces. When applying shotcrete to previously-placed shotcrete or concrete, provide a
saturated surface dry condition. Soak surfaces with water 2 to 24 hours before application.
Immediately before shotcreting, blow the surfaces free of water.
When applying shotcrete to soil, thoroughly compact the soil to provide a firm foundation. Ensure the
soil lack free surface water before placing shotcrete.
506

Section 566

(b) Reinforcing. Install reinforcing steel when required. Support reinforcing steel so it is not displaced
during shotcrete application. Support the reinforcing steel by anchor studs or bolts installed in the
existing surface. Space anchors at no more than 12 inches (300 millimeters) on overhead surfaces,
18 inches (450 millimeters) on vertical surfaces, and 36 inches (900 millimeters) on top horizontal
surfaces. Use at least three anchors in each individual area. Reinforce areas where shotcrete thickness
exceeds 1½ inches (38 millimeters) with a single layer of either 2 by 2 – W1.2 by W1.2 or 3 by
3 - W1.5 by W1.5 (50 by 50 – MW8 by W8 or 75 by 75 – MW10 by W10) welded wire fabric. Place
fabric parallel to the proposed finished surface. Support fabric at least ½ inch (13 millimeters) from the
existing surface. Provide a minimum 1 inch (25 millimeters) cover over steel items including anchors,
reinforcing bars and wire fabric.
(c) Temperature and weather conditions. Conduct cold and hot weather shotcreting operations
according to Subsection 552.10. Do not perform shotcrete operations during high winds and heavy
rains. Maintain the temperature of the shotcrete mix between 50 and 90 °F (10 and 30 °C). Do not
place shotcrete against frozen surfaces. Place shotcrete when the surface and ambient temperature is at
least 40 °F (5 °C) and rising.
(d) Shotcrete application. Use the same nozzle operator that created acceptable test panels.
(1) Apply shotcrete within 45 minutes of adding cement to the mixture unless an approved
hydration stabilizer is used. If a hydration stabilizer is approved, deliver and place the shotcrete
within the approved design discharge time limit up to 3½ hours maximum.
(2) Limit the layer thickness of each shotcrete application to 2 inches (50 millimeters). Thicker
applications may be approved if the Contractor can demonstrate that no sloughing or sagging is
occurring. If additional thickness is required, broom or scarify the applied surface and allow the
layer to harden. Provide a saturated surface dry condition to the surface before applying an
additional layer.
(3) Remove laitance, loose material, and rebound. Promptly remove rebound from the work area.
(4) Taper construction joints to a thin edge over a distance of at least 12 inches (300 millimeters).
Wet the joint surface before placing additional shotcrete on the joint. Do not use square
construction joints.
(5) Finish shotcrete as directed by the CO.
566.08 Curing Shotcrete. Cure the surface according to Subsection 552.15. For intermediate shotcrete
surfaces or if a stained or finished final surface is required, cure the shotcrete according to Subsection
552.15(b). If no stained or finished surface is required, apply curing compound to the final exposed
shotcrete surface according to Subsection 552.15(c). Maintain shotcrete at a temperature above 40 °F
(5 °C) until shotcrete has achieved a minimum compressive strength of 750 pounds per square inch
(5.2 megapascals).
566.09 Penetrating Stain. Apply according to the manufacturer’s instructions if penetrating stain is used.
566.10 Production Report. Prepare and submit a written report within 24 hours of shotcrete production
and application for each shift. Include the following information:
(a) Quantity and location of shotcrete applied including photos of areas where shotcrete was placed;

507

567.05 Installation. Stage micropile installation to avoid interconnection or damage to piles with
uncured grout.
Before drilling holes for constructing production micropiles, install pre-production micropiles for
verification load tests. Install verification and production micropiles as follows:
(a) Drilling. Provide equipment capable of drilling soil, boulder colluvium and alluvium, and
bedrock to anticipated depths. Drill micropile holes to the required diameter and length according to
Table 567-1 and the construction schedule and sequence.
If an obstruction prevents the advancement of the pile, abandon the hole and fill the hole with grout.
Drill a new hole at a location approved by the CO. Remove drill cuttings and other loose debris from
the hole.
(b) Casing, reinforcing bar, and splicing. Place reinforcing bars with centralizers according to
Table 567-1. Use centralizers sized to within ½ inch (13 millimeters) of the drill hole diameter.
Construct micropile splices to the required design strength. Align casing joints and reinforcing bar
splices to avoid eccentricity or angles at splices. Locate threaded pipe casing joints at least two
casing outer diameters from bar splices. When multiple bars are used, stagger the bar splices by at
least 12 inches (300 millimeters). If specified or approved, weld according to Subsection 551.11(a).
(c) Grouting. Use a positive displacement grout pump according to Subsection 256.07(b)(1). Use a
neat hydraulic cement grout in one continuous operation. Mix admixtures according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not use compressed air to directly pressurize the grout.

512

Section 567

Grout the micropile the same day the micropile hole is drilled. Inject grout from the lowest point of
the drill hole until clean, pure grout flows from the top of the micropile. Grout may be pumped
through tremie tubes, hollow stem augers, or drill rods. Ensure complete continuity of the grout
column during all phases of grouting and casing extraction. Control the grout pressures and grout
takes to prevent excessive heave in cohesive soils or fractured formations. Grout the entire pile to the
design cut-off level.
After grouting is complete, fill the grout tube with grout if it will remain in the hole. Allow grout
within the micropiles to attain the minimum design strength before loading.
Observe site conditions in the vicinity of the micropile construction on a daily basis and suspend
operations and notify the CO if:
(1) Ground heave, subsidence, or grout leakage is observed;
(2) Micropile structure is adversely affected; or
(3) Adjacent structures are damaged from drilling or grouting.

567.06 Testing and Stressing.
(a) Testing equipment. See Subsection 256.08(a).
(b) Stressing. Place stressing equipment over the micropile so that the jack, bearing plates, load
cells, and stressing assembly are axially aligned with the micropile and the micropile is centered
within the equipment. Do not apply loads greater 80 percent of the structural capacity of the
micropile.
Place the reference pressure gauge in series with the pressure gauge and jack so they need not be
unloaded and repositioned during a test. Raise the load from one increment to another. Hold the load
for the required time beginning immediately after the load is applied and record the micropile top
movement to the nearest 0.001 inch (0.025 millimeters) with respect to an independent fixed reference
point. Repump the jack as necessary to maintain a constant load. Monitor the load with a pressure
gauge. If the load measured by the pressure gauge and the load measured by the reference pressure
gauge differ by more than 10 percent, recalibrate the jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure
gauge.
(1) Verification tests. The CO will designate locations for sacrificial micropiles for verification
tests. Test according to Tables 567-2 and 567-4.

Section 567

A verification test is acceptable based on one of the following results:
(a) Total vertical movement does not exceed 0.375 inches (9.5 millimeters) under DL. If an
AL is used, then the allowable movement will be reduced by multiplying by a factor of
(DL-AL)/DL;
(b) Deflection rate is linear or decreasing and does not exceed 0.040 inch (1 millimeter) per
log cycle time from 1 to 10 minutes or 0.080 inch (2 millimeters) per log cycle time from 6 to
60 minutes under 1.30 times the DL; or
(c) Slope of the load versus deflection (at end of increment) curve does not exceed 0.025 inch
per kip (0.065 millimeters per Newton) at each test load increment.
If the micropile verification is unacceptable, test another to establish the cause and make design
or construction modifications. These modifications may include installing replacement test
micropiles, modifying the installation methods, increasing the bond length, regrouting with
pre-placed re-grout tubes, or changing the micropile type. Submit modifications requiring
changes to the structure and retest the new system as directed by the CO.
Submit micropile geometry, construction, testing details, and verification test results for approval
before installing production micropiles.
Remove verification test micropiles to an elevation below existing ground level.
If construction methods or foundation material change, perform additional verification tests.
(2) Proof tests. The CO will designate production micropiles for proof testing. Test according to
Tables 567-3 and 567-4.
A proof test is acceptable based on one of the following results:
(a) Total vertical movement does not exceed 0.5 inches (13 millimeters) under the unfactored
design load (DL). If an alignment load (AL) is used, then the allowable movement will be
reduced by multiplying by a factor of (DL-AL)/DL;
(b) Deflection rate is linear or decreasing and does not exceed 0.040 inch (1 millimeter) per
log cycle time from 1 to 10 minutes or 0.080 inch (2 millimeters) per log cycle time from 6 to
60 minutes under 1.30 times the unfactored design load (1.30 DL); or
(c) Slope of the load versus deflection (at end of increment) curve does not exceed 0.025 inch
per kip (0.065 millimeters per Newton) under the maximum test load (1.60 DL.)
If a proof-tested micropile is unacceptable, proof test another micropile in the immediate
vicinity. Establish the cause and make design or construction modifications for future piles.
Submit modification requiring changes to the structure for approval.

568.10 Mixing. See Subsection 552.07.
When required, add reinforcing fibers to the concrete mixture following manufacturer’s
recommendations. Mix until uniformly distributed in the concrete mixture. Gradually add fibers to the
concrete mixture.
568.11 Delivery. See Subsection 552.08, except do not use nonagitating equipment.
If reinforcing fibers reduce the workability, do not add additional water to concrete mixture. If approved
by the CO, add a water reducing admixture conforming to AASHTO M 194 or a high range water
reducing admixture.
568.12 Quality Control of Mix. See Subsection 552.09.
Deliver and sample concrete according to Subsection 552.09(b), except as modified in Table 568-2.
568.13 Temperature and Weather Conditions. Before placement, maintain the temperature of the
concrete between 50 and 80 °F (10 and 27 °C).
Install maturity meter probes and monitor concrete temperatures according to AASHTO T 325. Monitor
the temperature differential from the center of the concrete mass to its surface. Provide internal cooling,
external heating, or insulation to insure the temperature differential does not exceed 35 °F (20 °C)
during placing, curing, cooling, form stripping, and after curing ends.
During curing, maintain the temperature of the concrete mass interior below 140 °F (60 °C) and
temperature of the outer most surfaces above 45 °F (7 °C).
(a) Cold weather. See Subsection 552.10(a), except as follows:
(1) Place concrete for flatwork only when the ambient air temperature is 45 °F (7 °C) and rising.
Place concrete for other structural elements only when the ambient air temperature is 35 °F
(2 °C) and rising;
(2) Protect concrete until the concrete maturity data indicates that minimum compressive strength
is achieved; and
(3) At the end of the protection period, start the cooling process when the average wind speed is
less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) per hour as measured 3 feet (1 meter) from the concrete surface.
(b) Hot weather. See Subsection 552.10(b), except as follows:
(1) Place concrete when the ambient air temperature is less than 85 °F (30 °C.);
(2) Do not remove curing material until the concrete maturity data indicates that minimum
compressive strength is achieved and the moist curing period is complete; and
(3) Do not remove curing material until the calculated evaporation rate is less than 0.15 pounds
per square foot (0.74 kilograms per square meter) per hour as determined by Figure 552-1.

522

Section 568

(c) Evaporation. Do not place concrete if the predicted evaporation rate, determined without
fogging and other protective measures, is greater than 0.15 pounds per square foot (0.74 kilograms
per square meter) per hour as determined by Figure 552-1. For wind speed, use an anemometer with
full scale accuracy to within 4 percent and for relative humidity, use a psychrometer or hygrometer
with full scale accuracy to within 2 percent. Measure wind speed and relative humidity 24 inches
(600 millimeters) above the concrete surface.
Before placing, install and demonstrate fogging equipment for approval and identify personnel to
operate the equipment.
While placing, finishing, and curing surfaces; take care to prevent crusting and plastic shrinkage
cracking. Do not allow the surface of the freshly placed concrete to dry. Use fogging, windbreaks
and other protective measures as necessary to limit the expected evaporation rate to less than
0.1 pound per square foot (0.5 kilogram per square meter) per hour as determined by Figure 552-1.
Use pressure sprayers or atomizers to maintain a moist surface. Do not apply moisture under
pressure directly to the concrete surface. Do not allow water to accumulate to cause a flow or wash
on the concrete surface. Continue fogging the concrete surface until finishing operations are
complete and the surface is covered. Do not wait until final set to cover the concrete surface.
(d) Rain. Protect the concrete from rain during and after placement.
568.14 Handling and Placing Concrete. See Subsection 552.11.
568.15 Construction Joints. See Subsection 552.12.
568.16 Expansion and Contraction Joints. See Subsection 552.13.
568.17 Finishing Plastic Concrete. See Subsection 552.14.
568.18 Concrete Curing. Begin curing within 4 hours after the concrete achieves final set.
(a) Flatwork curing. Use the water method according to Subsection 552.15(b). Apply soaker hoses
or other approved methods to keep the coverings saturated. Keep the concrete saturated and covered
for the entire curing period.
(b) Structural elements. Use a combination of the forms in-place method according to Subsection
552.15(a) and the water method according to Subsection 552.15(b). If forms are stripped or loosened
before the end of the curing period, complete the remainder of the curing using the water method.
During hot and cold weather, cure until the in-place concrete compressive strength reaches the minimum
shown in Table 568-1 at measured locations according to AASHTO T 325. At other times, cure until the
in-place compressive strength reaches 80 percent of the minimum shown in Table 568-1. Cure flatwork
at least 14 days and structural elements at least 10 days.
If directed by the CO after curing, clean staining or efflorescence to provide a uniform color to the
concrete surface.
568.19 Texturing Driving Surfaces. After curing, produce a skid-resistant surface by saw cutting
grooves according to Subsection 552.14(c)(1).

Sampling and Testing Requirements
(1) Sample according to AASHTO R 60, except composite samples are not required.
(2) Cast at least three 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) maximum chloride permeability cylinders per set and carefully transport the cylinders to the job site
curing facility. Cure the cylinders for 7 days according to AASHTO M 201. Then cure at 100 °F ± 10 °F (38 °C ± 5 °C) in saturated lime water until AASHTO
T 277 sample conditioning begins. Have the testing done at 28 days in an independent laboratory that is qualified to perform the testing and is approved by the CO.
The set test result is the average of the measurements on three cylinders cast from the same load. If pigment is used in the concrete mixture, sample concrete at the
batch plant before and after adding pigment. Test at least three specimens with and without pigment. Determine the average difference between the pigmented and
nonpigmented test results. Adjust production test result by the average difference. Report both initial and adjusted test results.
(3) Cast at least eighteen 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) compressive strength cylinders per set and carefully transport the cylinders to the job site curing
facility. Have the testing done at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days in an independent laboratory that is qualified to perform the testing and is approved by the CO. A single
compressive strength test result is the average result from three cylinders cast from the same load.
(4) Drying shrinkage testing is not required if the concrete mixture contains 1.5 gallons per cubic yard (7.5 liters per cubic meter) of an approved shrinkage
reducing admixture.
(5) If testing is required, use 3- by 3- by 11-inch (75- by 75- by 275-millimeter) prisms for drying shrinkage specimens. Cast at least three drying shrinkage prisms
per set and carefully transport the prisms to the job site curing facility. Moist the prisms for the duration of the specified moist curing period for HPC elements.
Have the testing done in an independent laboratory that is qualified to perform the testing and is approved by the CO. The zero measurement for percent drying
shrinkage is the initial measurement taken at demolding of the specimens at 23½±½ hours after introduction of mixing water to the concrete mixture. Measure
percent drying shrinkage at the end of specified moist curing period for the structural elements, 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days after the end of the specified field moist
curing period. Drying shrinkage 28 days after the termination of moist curing (28 days drying) cannot exceed 60 percent of the maximum specified value. The set
drying shrinkage test result is the average result from three prisms cast from the same load.
(6) If reinforcing fibers are used at an addition rate greater than 0.3 percent by volume, measure slump at the batch plant before the addition of fibers.
(7) Cast at least six 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) compressive strength cylinders per set and carefully transport the cylinders to the job site curing facility.
Test three cylinders at 28 days. Use the remainder of cylinders as designated by the CO.

from the curb face; and
533

Section 569

(c) Proceed at a constant rate so final finishing is complete before a plastic film forms on the
concrete surface. Install a construction dam or bulkhead in case of major delay. During minor delays
of 1 hour or less, protect the end of the placement from drying with layers of wet burlap.
569.19 Concrete Curing. Prevent plastic shrinkage cracking and crusting of the surface. Use the water
method of curing according to Subsection 552.15(b). Use washed burlap and apply soaker hoses or other
approved methods to keep the coverings saturated at all times.
Install maturity meter probes and monitor concreter temperatures according to AASHTO T 325.
Maintain the concrete temperature of the outer most surfaces above 45 °F (7 °C). Monitor the
temperature differential from the center of the concrete mass to its surface. Using the strength-maturity
relationship developed for the approved concrete mixture, determine the in-place concrete compressive
strength of the concrete.
(a) Class HPC(O). Wet cure the concrete for at least 14 days. Provide internal cooling, external
heating, or insulation to ensure the temperature differential does not exceed 35 °F (20 °C). Cure until
the in-place concrete compressive strength of the overlay concrete reaches at least 80 percent of the
minimum compressive strength shown in Table 569-1.
(b) Class LMC. Wet cure the concrete for at least 48 hours and until the maturity meter reading
exceeds 48 maturity hours. Then air cure the concrete for an additional 48 hours and until the
maturity meter reading exceeds 96 maturity hours.
569.20 Texturing. After curing, visually inspect the overlay for cracking or other damage and inspect
for delamination. Perform bond test. Remove and replace delaminated or unbounded portions of the
overlay or portions damaged by rain for freezing. Clean staining or efflorescence to provide a uniform
color to the concrete overlay surface.
After the Table 569-1 bond strength is obtained, groove surface according to Subsection 552.14(c)(1).
Continuously remove slurry and other residue from the overlay by vacuum pickup or other approved
methods. Properly dispose of slurry and other residue off site.

Sampling, Testing, and Acceptance Requirements
(1) Cast at least three 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) maximum chloride permeability cylinders per set and carefully transport the
cylinders to the job site curing facility. Cure the HPC(O) cylinders for 7 days and the LMC cylinders for 3 days according to AASHTO M 201.
Then cure the HPC(O) cylinders at 100 °F ± 10 °F (38 °C ± 5 °C) in saturated lime water until AASHTO T 277 sample conditioning begins and
air dry the LMC cylinders at 73 °F ± 3 °F (23 °C ± 2 °C) at 40 to 60 percent relative humidity. Test for chloride permeability at 28 days by
measuring the total charge passed, in coulombs, over a specified period of time according to AASHTO T 277. The test result is the average of
the measurements on three cylinders cast from the same load. If pigment is used in the concrete mixture, sample concrete at the batch plant
before and after adding pigment. Test at least three specimens with and without pigment. Determine the average difference between the
pigmented and non-pigmented test results. Adjust production test results by the average difference. Report both initial and adjusted test results.
(2) For HPC(O), cast at least fifteen 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) compressive strength cylinders per set and carefully transport the
cylinders to the job site curing facility. Test three cylinders each at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. A single compressive strength test result is the
average result from three cylinders cast from the same load.
(3) For LMC, cast at least eighteen 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) compressive strength cylinders per set and carefully transport the
cylinders to the job site curing facility. Test three cylinders each at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days. A single compressive strength test result is the
average result from three cylinders cast from the same load.
(4) Drying shrinkage testing is not required if the concrete mixture contains 1.5 gallons per cubic yard (7.5 liters per cubic meter) of an
approved shrinkage reducing admixture.
(5) If testing is required, use 3- by 3- by 11-inch (75- by 75- by 275-millimeter) prisms for drying shrinkage specimens. Cast at least three
drying shrinkage prisms per set and carefully transport the prisms to the job site curing facility. Moist cure the prisms for the duration of the
specified moist curing period for HPC(O) elements. Measure for shrinkage in microstrains determined according to ASTM C157. The zero
measurement is the initial measurement taken at demolding of the specimens at 23½±½ hours after introduction of mixing water to the concrete
mixture. Determine percent drying shrinkage by measuring at the end of specified moist curing period for the structural elements, 1, 4, 7, 14,
28, and 56 days after the end of the specified field moist curing period. Drying shrinkage 28 days after the termination of moist curing (28 days
drying) cannot exceed 60 percent of the maximum specified value shown in Table 569-1. The set drying shrinkage test result is the average
result from three prisms cast from the same load.
(6) For LMC, measure density, slump, and plastic air content 5 minutes after discharge from the mixer chute. Cover wheelbarrow or other
receptacle used to hold sample with a sheet of plastic to prevent evaporation during the 5 minutes before sampling.
(7) If reinforcing fibers are used at an addition rate greater than 0.3 percent by volume, measure slump at the batch plant before adding fibers.
(8) Cast at least six 4- by 8-inch (100- by 200-millimeter) compressive strength cylinders per set and carefully transport the cylinders to the job
site curing facility. Test three cylinders at 28 days. Remainder of cylinders to be used as designated by the CO.

(9) At random locations determined by the CO, core 2-inch (50-millimeter) diameter specimens through the overlay and ½ inch (13 millimeters)
into the substrate concrete. Cure the specimens in situ for the same length of time as the overlay. Test the specimens in situ by attaching a
loading disk with fast setting, high strength epoxy. Measure the tensile pull off bond strength in pounds per square inch (megapascals)
according to ASTM C1583. The average bond strength is the average of the results from three test specimens adjusted as follows: For tests
where failure occurs in the substrate concrete at a depth of ¼ inch (6 millimeters) or greater for more than 50 percent of the specimen, use 150
pounds per square inch (1 megapascal) for that specimen test result in the calculation of the average of the three test specimens. When two of
the three test results have been adjusted, the average bond strength results shall be the greater of 150 pounds per square inch (1 megapascal) or
the calculated value.

Furnish nonperforated pipe for outlet pipe. Install outlet pipe according to Section 602. Immediately place
and secure a screen made of 0.055-inch (1.4-millimeter) diameter galvanized wire having approximately
½- by ½-inch (13- by 13-millimeter) mesh openings over the outlet ends of exposed pipes and weep holes.
605.04 Placing Underdrain. Join pipe sections securely with coupling fittings or bands. Join PVC and
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) pipe using either a flexible elastomeric seal or solvent cement. Join
polyethylene pipe with snap-on, screw-on, or wrap around coupling bands as recommended by the
manufacturer.
Backfill and compact trenches within the limits of the roadbed according to Section 209, except use
granular backfill material. Trenches for geocomposite underdrains within the limits of the roadbed may
also be backfilled with sand and compacted.
When underdrain is placed in ditch lines, prevent infiltration of surface water by placing material
conforming to AASHTO M 145, classification A-4, A-5, A-6, or A-7 in the top 12 inches (300 millimeter)
of the trench.
(a) Standard underdrain. Place the long dimension of the geotextile filter parallel to the centerline of
the trench. Position the geotextile filter, without stretching, in contact with the trench surface. Overlap
the joints at least 24 inches (600 millimeter) with the upstream geotextile filter placed over the
downstream geotextile filter.
Place collector pipe with the perforations facing downward.
Place granular backfill to a height of 12 inches (300 millimeter) above the top of the collector pipe and
compact. Do not displace the collector pipe. Place and compact the remainder of the granular backfill
material according to Section 209.
Fold the geotextile filter over the top of the granular backfill with a minimum overlap of 12 inches
(300 millimeter).
(b) Geocomposite underdrain. Extend the geotextile filter from the bottom of the drainage core
around the collector pipe.
Construct splices and install outlet fittings according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Prevent
infiltration of soil into the geocomposite core.
Place the assembled geocomposite in the trench with the face of the geocomposite against the inflow
side of the trench. If the trench wall is irregular, smooth the trench wall or place a layer of granular
backfill between the geocomposite and the trench wall. Temporarily support the drain against the
trench wall while backfilling.
When the trench is less than 18 inches (450 millimeter) wide, backfill the trench using sand.
Backfilling and compacting in layers is not required. Compact the sand by vibrating or tamping with a
mechanical tamper.
When the trench is equal to or greater than 18 inches (450 millimeter) wide, place granular backfill or
sand to a height of 12 inches (300 millimeter) above the top of the collector pipe and compact. Place
and compact the remainder of the granular backfill material or sand according to Section 209.

Section 605

For pipe drain installations draining directly to daylight, cover the outlet end of the pipe with a
removable screen made of 0.055-inch (1.4-millimeter) diameter galvanized wires having approximate
½- by ½-inch (13- by 13-millimeter) mesh openings.
605.05 Placing Geocomposite Sheet Drain. Do not place sheet drain against a mortar course less than
4 days old.
When a geocomposite is used in conjunction with a waterproof membrane, install drainage panels
compatible with the membrane using methods recommended by the membrane manufacturer. Assemble
and place the geocomposite drain against the surface to be backfilled according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Splice geocomposite drains so the flow across the edges is continuous. Overlap the geotextile filter at least
3 inches (75 millimeter) in the direction of water flow. For vertical splices, overlap the geotextile filter in
the direction backfill proceeds.
Connect the drainage core to the collector pipe or weep holes so the flow is continuous through the system.
Extend the geotextile filter from the bottom of the drainage core around the collector pipe.
Backfill with structural backfill and compact according to Subsections 209.09 and 209.10.
605.06 Placing Geocomposite Pavement Edge Drain. Assemble the geocomposite pavement edge drain
and outlet material according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and place it in the trench. If the
trench wall is irregular, smooth the trench wall or place a layer of sand between the geocomposite and the
trench wall. Temporarily support the drain against the trench wall while backfilling.
When the trench is less than 18 inches (450 millimeter) wide, backfill the trench using sand. Backfilling
and compacting in layers is not required. Compact the sand by vibrating or tamping with a mechanical
tamper.
When the trench is 18 inches (450 millimeter) wide or more, place and compact granular backfill or sand
according to Section 209.

Conform to the dimensions of stone curb specified and the following:
(a) Type 1. Saw or point the top surface of vertical stone curb to an approximate true plane with no
depression or projection on that surface of over ¼ inch (6 millimeters). Pitch the front and back arris
lines straight and true. Limit projections or depressions on the back surface to not exceed a batter of
1 inch (25 millimeters) horizontal to 3 inches (75 millimeters) vertical.
Saw, point, or smooth quarry split the front exposed face of the vertical stone curb and form to an
approximately true plane. Limit projections or depressions on the remaining face distance to 1 inch
(25 millimeters) or less from the plane of the exposed face.
Square the ends of vertical stone curb with the top back and face and finish so when the sections are
placed end to end, shows no space more than ½ inch (13 millimeters) in the joint for the full width of
the top surface and for the entire exposed front face. The remainder of the end may break back no
more than 4 inches (100 millimeters) from the plane of the joint. Cut the joints of circular or curved
stone curb on radial lines.
Make stone curb segments at least 48 inches (1200 millimeters) long, but the length may vary where a
depressed or modified section of curb is required for driveways, crossings, or closures.

566

Section 609

(b) Type 2. Conform to the requirements of Type 1 stone curb for slope stone curb, except as follows:
The maximum allowable projection or depression on a horizontal top surface is limited to ½ inch
(13 millimeters). On other exposed faces, the maximum allowable projection or depression is limited
to 1 inch (25 millimeters).
For unexposed surfaces, the maximum allowable projection or depression from a true plane on a
24-inch (600-millimeter) length is 3 inches (75 millimeters).
The maximum allowable space showing on exposed faces between adjacent segments of slope stone
curb is ¾ inch (19 millimeters). Make slope stone curb segments at least 24 inches (600 millimeters)
long.
Clean the curb material thoroughly and wet it just before setting. Set the curb in bedding material so the
face and top lines are to line and grade. Make the joints ½ to 1 inch (13 to 25 millimeters) wide and fill the
joints with mortar.
Complete the first 25 feet (8 meters) of curb to demonstrate the ability to build a curb conforming to these
requirements. Do not continue construction until the 25-foot (8-meter) test section is approved.
Where a concrete pavement is constructed contiguous to the curb, construct the joints in the curb directly
in line with the pavement expansion joints.
Make the curb joint ¾ inch (19 millimeters) wide and fill it with expansion joint filler of the same nominal
thickness as the pavement joint. Fill voids between the joint filler and the curb with mortar.
609.05 Concrete Curb or Curb and Gutter. Perform work according to Section 601. The curb or curb
and gutter may be cast-in-place or slip-formed.

interval horizontally. Set posts vertically.
Set posts in concrete according to Section 601.
595

Section 619

Where solid rock is encountered without overburden, drill line post holes at least 14 inches
(350 millimeters) deep. Drill end, corner, gate, and pull posts at least 20 inches (500 millimeters)
deep in the solid rock. Make the hole width or diameter at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) greater
than the post width or diameter. Cut the post to the required length before installation or drill the
hole deep enough to set the post at the required height. Set and plumb the post and fill the hole
with grout. Thoroughly work the neat hydraulic cement grout into the hole to eliminate voids.
Crown the grout to drain water away from the post.
Where solid rock is covered with soil or loose rock overburden, set posts to the plan depth or to
the minimum depth into the solid rock as specified above, whichever is less. When solid rock is
encountered before the plan depth, grout the portion of the post in solid rock and backfill the post
hole from the solid rock to the top of the ground with concrete.
Provide end, gate, corner, and pull posts with adjacent brace posts as shown in the plans. A
change in the fence alignment of 20 degrees or more is considered a corner.
(2) Top rail. Install top rails through the loop caps of the line posts, forming a continuous brace
from end-to-end of each stretch of fence. Join lengths of top rail with sleeve-type couplings.
Securely fasten top rails to terminal posts by pressed steel fittings or other appropriate means.
(3) Tension wire. Attach tension wire to end, gate, corner, or pull posts by bands and clamps.
Either thread the top tension wire through the line post loop caps or hold in open slots in a
manner to limit vertical movement. Tie or attach the bottom tension wire to the bottom of the
line posts by ties or clamps in a manner that prevents vertical movement. Apply sufficient
tension to avoid excess sag between posts. On the top tension wire, provide one turnbuckle or
ratchet take-up in each run of fence.
(4) Fence fabric. For fences placed on the right-of-way, place fence fabric on the post face away
from the highway. On curved alignment, place the fence fabric on the post face on the outside of
the curve. For residential fences and fences off the right-of-way, place fence fabric on the post
face designated by the CO.
Place the fabric approximately 1 inch (25 millimeters) above the ground and on a straight line
between posts. Excavate high points of the ground to maintain grade. Do not fill in depressions
without prior approval.
Stretch the fabric taut and securely fasten the fabric to the posts. Do not stretch using a motor
vehicle. Use stretcher bars and fabric bands to fasten to end, gate, corner, and pull posts or weave
the fabric into the fastening loops of roll-formed posts.
Fasten fabric to line posts using wire ties, metal bands, or other approved method. Fasten the top
and bottom edge of the fabric with tie wires or hog rings to the top rail or tension wires as
applicable.
Join rolls of fabric by weaving a single strand into the ends of the rolls to form a continuous
mesh.
(5) Gates. Fasten fabric to the end bars of the gate frame by stretcher bars and fabric bands.
Fasten fabric to the top and bottom bars of the gate frame by tie wires similar to the method
specified for fence fabric or by other approved standard methods.

596

Section 619

Thoroughly clean welded connections on gate frames where the smelter coating has been burned
with a wire brush. Remove traces of the welding flux and loose or cracked smelter. Paint the
cleaned areas with two coats of zinc-oxide paint.
Provide a concrete footing for the drop-bar locking device on double metal gates. Make a hole to
receive the locking bar to the depth specified by the manufacturer of the locking device.
Hinge each single gate to prevent removal of the gate without tools. Set the gate in an
approximately horizontal plane. Set the gate so it swings freely inward and outward and fastens
securely in its latch holder, or in the case of double gates, in its latch holder and gate stops. Set
double gates on their respective hinge pintles to provide a common horizontal plane in which
each single gate swings. Set gates to swing open at least 90 degrees in each direction.
(c) Wire fences and gates.
(1) Posts. Excavate holes for posts, footings, and anchors as shown. Space posts at intervals
shown for the type of fence being installed. Measure post spacing interval parallel to the existing
ground slope. Set posts in a vertical position. Backfill post holes in 6-inch (150-millimeter) lifts.
Tamp and compact each lift.
Wood posts may be driven in place if the method of driving does not damage the post. Metal
posts may be driven. Set metal corner, gate, end, and pull posts in concrete.
Where solid rock is encountered without overburden, drill line post holes at least 14 inches
(350 millimeters) deep and end, corner, gate, and pull posts at least 20 inches (500 millimeters)
deep in the solid rock. Make the hole width or diameter at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) greater
than the post width or diameter. Cut the post to the required length before installation or drill the
hole deep enough to set the post at the required height. Set and plumb the post and fill the hole
with grout. Thoroughly work the grout into the hole to eliminate voids. Crown the grout to drain
water away from the post. Metal posts set in this manner do not require anchor plates and
concrete footings.
Where solid rock is covered with soil or loose rock overburden, set posts to the plan depth or to
the minimum depth into the solid rock as specified above, whichever is less. When the depth of
overburden is greater than 12 inches (300 millimeters), use an anchor plate on steel line posts
and backfill steel end, corner, gate, and pull posts with concrete from the solid rock to top of the
ground. When the depth of overburden is 12 inches (300 millimeters) or less, anchor plates and
concrete backfill are not required. Grout the portion of the post in solid rock.
Install corner posts at changes in alignment of 30 degrees or more. Where new fence joins an
existing fence, set end or corner posts, as necessary, and attach in a manner satisfactory to the
CO.
(2) Braces. Limit fence runs to no more than 650 feet (200 meters) between adjacent corner
braces, gate braces, end braces, or line braces. Install line braces at uniform intervals so the
distance between any two braces is 650 feet (200 meters) or less. Construct braces before placing
the fence fabric and wires on posts.
(a) Metal braces. Provide corner posts and pull posts with two braces, one each direction
from the post in the main fence line. Provide end posts and gate posts with one brace in the
line of the fence. Attach metal braces to the metal end, corner, pull, and gate posts and set in
concrete as shown in the plans.
597

Section 619

(b) Wood braces. Tap the posts to receive the braces. Anchor the brace to the post with three
16d nails or a ⅜- by 4-inch (10- by 100-millimeter) dowel. Install brace wires as shown and
twist together until the entire assembly is taut and firm. Lightly notch the posts to position
the brace wire. Drive three staples at each notch to secure wire.
(3) Barbed wire and woven wire. Place barbed wire and woven wire on the side of the post
facing away from the highway. On curved alignment, place the barbed wire and the woven wire
on the post face on the outside of the curve. Tightly stretch and fasten barbed wire and woven
wire to the posts.
Apply tension according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using a mechanical stretcher or
other device designed for such use. Evenly distribute the pull over the longitudinal wires in the
woven wire so not more than 50 percent of the original depth of the tension curves is removed.
Do not use a motor vehicle to stretch the wire.
Splicing of barbed wire and woven wire between posts is permitted provided not more than two
splices, spaced at least 50 feet (15 meters) apart, occur in a run of fence. Use wrap or telephone
type splices for the longitudinal woven wire and barbed wire with each end wrapped around the
other wire for not less than six complete turns.
(4) Fastening barbed wire and woven wire. End the woven wire and barbed wire at each end,
corner, gate, and pull post. Wrap each line of barbed wire and each longitudinal wire of the
woven wire around the post and then itself with at least four turns. Where wood posts are used,
staple the wires tightly to the posts.
At line posts, fasten the woven wire to the post at top and bottom and at intermediate points not
exceeding 12 inches (300 millimeters) apart. Fasten each strand of barbed wire to each line post.
Use wire ties or clamps to fasten the wires to metal posts. Securely splice tie wires to the fence
on both sides of the post so there are two loops behind the post and one loop in front. On wood
line posts, drive U-shaped staples diagonally across the wood grain so that both points do not
enter between the same grain. In depressions where wire uplift occurs, drive staples with points
slightly upward. On level ground and over knolls, slope the points slightly downward. Drive the
staples just short of actual contact with the wires to permit free longitudinal movement of those
lines and to prevent damage to the protective coating.
At grade depressions, alignment angles, and other locations where stresses tending to pull posts
from the ground or out of alignment are created, snub or guy the wire fence. Attach the guy wire
to each strand of barbed wire and to the top and bottom wires of woven wire in a manner to
maintain the entire fence in its normal shape. Attach the guy wire to a deadman anchor buried
not less than 24 inches (600 millimeters) in the ground or to an approved anchor at a point that
best serves to resist the pull of the wire fence. If necessary to guy the fence in solid rock, grout
the guy wire in a hole 2 inches (50 millimeters) in diameter and 10 inches (250 millimeters)
deep. Deadman may also be fastened to posts. Place the deadman anchors at locations as
directed.
Where required, install vertical cinch stays as shown. Twist the wire to permit weaving into the
horizontal fence wires to provide rigid spacing. Weave barbed wires and the top, middle, and
bottom wire of the woven wire as applicable, into the cinch stay.
Where existing fence intersects the new fence, cut the existing fence material or, splice in kind,
new material as necessary, and fasten each longitudinal wire of the woven wire and each strand
of the barbed wire to a new end post in line with or immediately adjacent to the new fence line.
598

Section 619

(5) Gates.
(a) Wire gates. Construct wire gates of the same material as the fence and as shown. Provide
a taut and well-aligned closure of the opening, capable of being readily opened and closed by
hand.
(b) Metal gates. Install metal gates and fittings to gate posts previously set. Firmly attach the
fittings to the posts and gates. Hinge each single gate to prevent removal of the gate without
tools. Set the gate in a horizontal plane. Set the gate so it swings freely inward and outward
and fastens securely in its latch holder, or in the case of double gates, in its latch holder and
gate stops. Set double gates and their respective pintles to provide a common horizontal
plane in which each single gate swings. Set gates to swing open at least 90 degrees in each
direction.
For double gates, provide a drop-bar locking device with a concrete footing 12 inches
(300 millimeters) in diameter and 12 inches (300 millimeters) deep. Crown the top of the
footing and make a hole to receive the locking bar. Make the diameter and depth of the hole
in the footing as specified by the manufacturer of the locking device.
(c) Wood gates. Install wood gates similar to metal gates and as shown in the plans.
619.04 Grounding Fences. Where an electric line crosses the fence line, ground the fence. Drive an 8-foot
(2.4-meter) long, ½-inch (13-millimeter) minimum diameter galvanized or copper coated steel rod into the
ground under the fence directly below the point of crossing. Drive the rod vertically until the top is
6 inches (150 millimeters) below the ground surface. Connect the grounding rod to each fence element
with a ¼-inch (6-millimeter) diameter solid copper conductor or equivalent. Either braze the connections
or fasten with noncorrosive clamps.
Where an electric line runs parallel or nearly parallel to and above the fence, ground the fence at each end
or gate post or at intervals not exceeding 1,600 feet (500 meters).
Where vertical penetration of the grounding rod cannot be accomplished, use an equivalent horizontal
grounding system.
619.05 Remove and Reset Fence. Remove existing fence and reset to approximately the same condition
as the original fence. Salvage material in the existing fence and incorporate the material into the reset
fence. When posts are set in concrete, remove concrete from old post and reset in new concrete. Replace
fence material damaged beyond reuse. Firmly reset posts on new alignment. Space posts and attach the
horizontal members or wires to posts the same as the original fence. Furnish and use new material to fasten
members or wires to posts.
619.06 Temporary Fence. When necessary, construct temporary fence to keep traffic (such as pedestrian,
livestock, and vehicular) off the project. Maintain the temporary fence during construction of the project or
until the fence is directed to be removed. Dispose of temporary fence according to Subsection 203.05(a).
619.07 Cattle Guards.
(a) Excavating and backfilling. Perform the work described under Section 209. Excavate foundation
to depth with sufficient space for proper installation of formwork.

620.06 Pointing.
(a) Pointing new joints. Crown the joint mortar slightly on top surfaces to provide drainage.
Where raked joints are required, squarely rake mortar in exposed face joints and beds to the required
depth. Slightly rake the mortar where weather joints are required. Do not leave the mortar flush with
the stone faces.
Clean stone faces of mortar stains while the mortar is fresh. After the mortar sets, clean stone faces
again using wire brushes and acid. Protect masonry during hot or dry weather by keeping it moist for at
least 3 days after the work is completed.
(b) Repointing joints. Remove loose mortar from joints using a small mason’s chisel, small
pneumatically-power chisel, or other raking tool approved by the CO. Do not use power saws or
grinders. Demonstrate proficiency if power equipment is used before removing mortar from the
structure. Remove mortar to a depth of two and one-half times the width of the joint. Remove dirt or
vegetation with a wire brush or other approved tools. Clean joint of loose fragments and dust with
pressurized air or water.
Construct a 36-inch (900-millimeter) test section of joint along the structure for approval before
continuing with work. Approved test section may be incorporated into the work. Moisten adjacent
stone before filling the joint. Do not place mortar to a depth greater than two and one-half times the
joint width. Place mortar in layers of approximately ¼ inch (6 millimeters) for joints deeper than
⅛ inch (3 millimeters). Add successive layers once mortar has reached thumb-print hardness. Tool the
final layer to match the approved joint appearance.
Clean excess mortar and stain from stone masonry using a bristle brush after the mortar has dried, but
before the initial set. Do not use chemicals for cleaning. Protect masonry during hot or dry weather by
keeping it moist for at least 3 days after the work is completed.
620.07 Constructing Walls. Construct an L-shaped test section of wall at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) high
and 8 feet (2.4 meters) long; showing examples of face wall, top wall, method of turning corners, and
method of forming joints. Do not construct masonry other than the foundation masonry before the test
section is approved.
Set face stones to produce the effect demonstrated in the approved test section. Do not extend bed joints in
an unbroken line through more than five stones and head joints through more than two stones. Bond each
face stone with contiguous face stones at least 6 inches (150 millimeters) longitudinally and 2 inches
(50 millimeters) vertically. Do not allow the corners of four stones to be adjacent to each other.
Do not bunch small stones or stones of the same size, color, or texture. Construct walls using stones
decrease in size from the bottom to the top. Use large, stones in corners.
(a) Headers. Distribute headers uniformly throughout the walls of structures to form at least
20 percent of the faces.
(b) Backing. Construct the backing out of large stones. Bond the individual stones composing the
backing and heart with the stones in the face wall and with each other. Fill openings and interstices in
the backing with mortar or with spalls surrounded by mortar.

604

Section 620

(c) Coping. Finish with coping when shown in the plans. When copings are not required, finish the top
of the wall with stones wide enough to cover the top of the wall from 1.5 to 5 feet (0.5 to 1.5 meters) in
length, and of random heights, with a minimum height of 6 inches (150 millimeters). Lay stones in a
manner that the cap course is an integral part of the wall. Pitch the top of the capstones to align in both
vertical and horizontal planes.
(d) Parapet walls. Use stones squared and pitched to line and with heads dressed in the ends of
parapet walls and in exposed angles and corners. Interlock spreaders with as many headers as possible.
Extend headers through the entire wall thickness. Interlock both the headers and stretchers in the two
faces of the wall. Use headers and stretchers to comprise a majority of the wall volume. Fill openings
and interstices with mortar or with spalls surrounded by mortar.
(e) Weep holes. Place weep holes at the lowest points where free outlets can be obtained. Space holes
no more than 10 feet (3 meters) apart.
620.08 Facing for Concrete.
(a) Stone placed before concrete. Make the back of the masonry uneven. Pack voids in the back of
the masonry with grout.
Use No. 4 (13M) reinforcing steel bent into an elongated letter "S" to anchor the stone. Embed each
anchor in a mortar bed to within 2 inches (50 millimeters) from the face of the stones. Project the other
end about 10 inches (250 millimeters) into the concrete backing. Space the anchors 18 inches
(450 millimeter) apart both horizontally and vertically.
Clean the back masonry surface of dirt, loose material, and mortar drippings after the mortar has
attained sufficient strength. Wash surfaces with pressurized water before placing concrete.
(b) Concrete placed before stone. Set galvanized metal anchor slots flush with the projected face of
concrete. Set the slots vertically at maximum horizontal spacings of 24 inches (600 millimeters). Use
foam filled slots to prevent filling with concrete.
Fit the metal anchors in the slots at a maximum vertical spacing of 24 inches (600 millimeters). Extend
the anchors to within 2 inches (50 millimeters) of the face of the stones.
If the shape of the concrete face is unsuitable for the use of metal slots, use 9 gage (3.8-millimeter)
galvanized iron wire ties at a rate of six ties for each square yard (seven ties for each square meter) of
exposed surface.
Keep the concrete face continuously wet for 2 hours preceding the placing of the stone and fill
interstices with mortar or with spalls surrounded by mortar.
620.09 Constructing Arches. Submit drawings for falsework according to Section 562. Stratify arch ring
stones parallel to the radial joint and stratify other stones parallel to the beds.
Lay out a full-size template of the arch ring showing face dimensions of each ring stone and thickness of
joints. Do not shape or dress ring stones until falsework drawings have been approved. Do not place ring
stones until all ring stones have been shaped and dressed.

605

Section 620

Construct arch centering according to the drawings. Provide suitable wedges for adjusting the elevation of
the forms.
Set arch ring stones and hold in place with wedges until the joints are packed with mortar. If required,
support centering with jacks to prevent settlement during masonry placement. Lower the centering
gradually and symmetrically to avoid overstresses in the arch. Ensure the arch is self-supporting before
installing coping or other features.
Strike the centers of filled spandrel arches before constructing the spandrel walls to avoid jamming of the
expansion joints. Place the backfill so the ring is uniformly and symmetrically loaded.
620.10 Guardwall. Use rubble masonry. Construct cast-in-place or precast concrete corewalls according
to Section 601. Use concrete with a minimum 28-day compressive strength of 3,500 pounds per square
inch (25 megapascals).
Construct a 25-foot (8-meter) test section of guardwall. Do not construct additional guardwall until the test
section is approved.
Construct the guardwall true and uniform along its length with no stone projecting more than 1½ inches
(38 millimeters) beyond the face of the guardwall. Construct masonry beds and joints for face stones to the
thicknesses shown in Table 620-1. Rake the joints and beds to a depth of 2 inches (50 millimeters) on the
front and top sides and to a depth of 1½ inches (38 millimeters) on the back.
Use a one-piece capstone for the full width of the guardwall for at least 25 percent of the total length. Use
a two-piece capstone with the joint within 4 inches (100 millimeters) of the guardwall center for the
remaining length.
Place stones (including the capstones) randomly to avoid a pattern. Lay stones to reflect the width of the
expansion joints. Do not leave a gap or a mortar edge at the expansion joint. Use various size stones to
coin or key the corners of the guardwall.

Section 629. — ROLLED EROSION CONTROL PRODUCTS
AND CELLULAR CONFINEMENT SYSTEMS
Description
629.01 This work consists of constructing temporary and permanent installations to control erosion
and enhance vegetation establishment and survivability on slopes and channels. This work also
includes installing rolled erosion control products (RECP) and cellular confinement systems.
RECP are designated according to Subsections 713.17, 713.18, and the following:
(a) Mulch control netting. A planar woven natural fiber or extruded geosynthetic mesh used as a
temporary degradable RECP to anchor loose fiber mulches.
(b) Open weave textile. A temporary degradable RECP composed of processed natural or
polymer yarns woven into a matrix, used to provide erosion control and facilitate vegetation
establishment.
(c) Erosion control blanket. A temporary degradable RECP composed of processed natural or
polymer fibers mechanically, structurally or chemically bound together to form a continuous matrix
to provide erosion control and facilitate vegetation establishment.
(d) Turf reinforcement mat. A permanent non-degradable RECP designed for critical hydraulic
applications where design discharges exert velocities and shear stresses that exceed the limits of
mature, natural vegetation. Turf reinforcement mats provide sufficient thickness, strength, and void
space to permit soil filling and retention and the development of vegetation within the matrix. Turf
reinforcement mats are typically used in hydraulic application (such as high flow ditches and
channels, steep slopes, stream banks, and shorelines) where erosive forces may exceed the limits of
natural, unreinforced vegetation or in areas where limited vegetation establishment is anticipated.
Turf reinforcement mats may be supplemented with degradable components to provide immediate
and permanent erosion protection and vegetation reinforcement on geotechnically stable slopes.
Cellular confinement system cell depths are designated according to Table 713-2.

(1) Staples. Install the RECP 36 inches (900 millimeters) over the shoulder of the slope onto
flat final grade. Secure with a single row of staples on 12-inch (300-millimeter) centers;
(2) Anchor trench. Construct a 6- by 6-inch (150- by 150-millimeter) trench. Extend the
upslope terminal end of the RECP 36 inches (900 millimeters) past the trench. Use staples
on 12-inch (300-millimeter) centers to fasten the RECP into the trench. Backfill the trench and
compact the soil. Secure the terminal end with a single row of staples on 12-inch
(300-millimeter) centers and cover the end with soil. Apply turf establishment; or
(3) Check slot. Install two rows of staples 4 inches (100 millimeters) apart on 4-inch
(100-millimeter) centers across the top edge of the RECP. Drive staple heads flush with soil
surface.
Securely fasten RECP to the soil by installing staples at a minimum rate of 1.5 per square yard
(1.3 per square meter).
(b) Channel installations. At the beginning of the channel, construct a full width anchor trench
according to Subsection 629.05(a)(2). Construct additional anchor trenches or check slots at intervals
along the channel reach and at the channel end according to Subsection 629.05(a)(2) or (a)(3) and
the manufacturer’s installation guidelines.

vehicle equipped with a truck-mounted attenuator (crash cushion) attached to the rear of the vehicle,
exterior flashing yellow dome light, and an arrow board.
Use the shadow vehicle to provide physical protection to workers from traffic approaching from the rear
during moving operations.

636

Section 635

Use the following procedures to close a lane of traffic:
(a) Move the shadow vehicle to a point approximately 200 feet (60 meters) from the first advance
warning sign for the lane closure and stop on the shoulder;
(b) Activate the flashing lights and flashing arrow board. Begin the arrow board in the caution mode
and after approximately 2 minutes display the correct flashing pass arrow;
(c) Move the shadow vehicle (now acting as a protection vehicle) along the shoulder to the first sign
location, stopping approximately 100 feet (30 meters) before the sign location in a blocking position;
(d) Place the first sign then proceed to the next advance sign location. Repeat step (c) for the second
sign and install that sign. Repeat this procedure until advance warning signs are installed;
(e) After installing the advanced warning signs for the lane closure, move the shadow vehicle into the
lane that is to be closed to a position 100 feet (30 meters) before the closing taper location. Install the
channelizing devices for the taper in the shielded lane; then
(f) Move the shadow vehicle off the roadway and past the taper on the shoulder and remain in position
until the flashing arrow board for the closure (if one is to be provided) is placed and operating. Move
the shadow vehicle with the workers as they proceed to set up the remaining devices as additional
protection.
Alternate lane closure procedures may be used if approved by the CO.
635.17 Pavement Patch. Use an asphalt mix according to Section 403 or commercial available cold
asphalt mix to repair potholes and rough spots in the traveled way before reopening travel lanes to traffic.
If cold asphalt mix is used, remove and replace with hot asphalt mix before placing succeeding hot asphalt
lifts.
635.18 Temporary Crash Cushions. Use a crashworthy temporary crash cushion according to
manufacturer’s recommendations.

of any roll in a lot sampled for conformance or quality assurance testing must meet or exceed the
minimum specified values).
The nominal long-term strength (Tal) is based on:
Tal = Tult/RF
where RF = RFID × RFCR × RFD.
RFID, RFCR, and RFD values must be substantiated by evaluation of independent test results by Highway
Innovative Technology Evaluation Center (HITEC), AASHTO National Transportation Product
Evaluation Program (NTPEP), or an equivalent third party report. Provide a copy of the report to the
CO. Determine RFID, RFCR, and RFD according to the following:

701

Section 714

(a) RFID: Determine the reduction factor for installation damage from the results of full scale
construction damage tests conducted according to ASTM D5818. Conduct the tests with a soil
having the same maximum particle size, D50, and angularity as the soil to be used for construction.
Tests using coarser soils (same or larger maximum particle size and D50) may be an acceptable
substitution. The CO will make the final determination as to whether the test data based on the
substitute soil is acceptable. Interpolation of RFID will not be allowed, the results for the coarser soils
will be used. The Contractor may elect to perform a test using project specific fill, placement, and
compaction techniques and equipment to determine the RFID. Use a default value of 3.0 if no
installation damage testing has been conducted. The minimum value for RFID is 1.1.
(b) RFCR. Determine the creep reduction factor according to one of the following:
