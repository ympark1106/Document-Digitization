 Standard Specifications
 for Highway Construction
 January 2015
 
 FOREWORD
 USE OF NEW BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL STANDARDS
 The standards in the DTI Standard Specifications are intended to be used as pre-printed components of a construction Contract. They are not prepared as design aids or as a manual of design procedures and they will not competently serve those purposes.
 It is the responsibility of the Bidder/Contractor to ensure they have an upto-date copy of the Standard Construction Contract including the Articles of Agreement, Terms of Payment "A", General Conditions "B", and the Standard Specifications. The Standard Specifications are compliant with the Crown Construction Contracts Act.
 Bid Items in the Standard Specifications are intended to be complete units of Work and clearly identify the scope, material requirements, and specific construction provisions to produce the specified end product.
 Requirements of the Notice of Tender are incorporated by reference and shall form part of the Contract as if they had appeared here in their entirety.
 The Standard Specifications rely on the use of specific words and phrases as defined in the Definitions (Item 003).
 The Standard Specifications form part of the Contract Documents and govern the performance of the Contractor even though an Item is not specifically noted as a bid Quantity. Items which are not noted as a bid Quantity are found under the following Divisions: Division 000 Introduction; Division 800 - Payment & Adjustments; and Division 900 Standard Conditions. It is imperative that users of these Standard Specifications understand this inter-relationship to the overall Contract and requisite behaviour of the Contractor within the context of the Contract.

 .1 Beads shall be treated so as to overcome the effect of water (vapour or liquid) on the beads before the beads are added to the painted marking.
 .2 Beads shall not agglomerate during storage and application, and shall flow freely from dispensing equipment whenever surface and atmospheric conditions are satisfactory for painting.
 .3 Moisture resistance will be tested on a 100g sample of beads placed in a 500 mL beaker, to which an equivalent volume of distilled water shall be added. After standing for 5 minutes the water shall be decanted and the glass beads transferred to a clean dry beaker.
 .1 After standing for 5 minutes the beads shall be poured slowly via a funnel into a standard stem of 125 mm length and 10 mm inside diameter.
 
 .2 The beads shall flow through the stem without stoppage. Slight initial agitation to start the flow at the beginning of the test is permissible.
 
 571.2.3 .5 Chemical Stability
 
 .1 Exposure of glass beads to paint film constituents, humidity, atmospheric conditions or diluted acid or alkali solutions shall not result in dulling of the surface that would adversely affect reflective properties of the beads.
 .2 Glass beads shall be resistant to deterioration by calcium chloride, as determined on a 10 g sample of beads placed in a 1000 mL beaker, covered with 500 mL of a calcium chloride solution (1.0 normal solution), left to soak for three hours, rinsed with 100 mL of distilled water three times, and air dried.
 .1 The beads will be examined under a microscope and compared with an untreated sample. Dulling of the surface of the beads or other detrimental effects shall constitute failure of this test.

 .6 Dual Coating of Glass Beads
 .1 The beads shall have both a moisture-resistant silicone coating, and an adhesionpromoting silane coating. The beads shall pass the moisture resistance test (per 571.2.3.4), and the adherence coating test.
 .2 The adherence coating test shall use a solution of 0.2 grams of dansyl chloride dissolved in 25 mL of acetone. This solution may be used for several tests during the day if kept refrigerated in a closed dark container between uses. A fresh solution shall be made daily.
 .3 The adherence coating test shall be performed as follows:  Weigh 10 grams of beads and place in aluminium trays.  Saturate the beads with dansyl chloride solution using an eyedropper.  Dry the beads in an oven at 60 C for 15 minutes. (Beads will be yellow and agglomerated.)  Rinse the beads in a funnel lined with new filter paper and pour 100 mL of acetone over them. Use suction during this step.  Remove the beads from the funnel and place in aluminium trays.  Over-dry the beads until free flowing.  Place the glass beads on filter paper and inspect colour under ultra-violet light in a dark room. A yellow-green fluorescence will be observed if adherence coating is present.
 .4 If all beads have a yellow-green fluorescence, the adherence coating is properly applied and the beads are acceptable. If only some of the beads have a yellow-green fluorescence, the beads are not properly coated and this is a cause for rejection. If no yellow-green fluorescence is seen adherence coating was not applied and this is a cause for rejection.

 ADJUSTMENT FOR ASPHALT BINDER PRICE
 
 ITEM: 821
 
 821.1 DESCRIPTION
 .1 Compensation payable to the Contractor or the Owner, for the difference in price of Asphalt Binder between the time of tender opening for the Contract and the time of the Work under this Item, shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
 .1 The Owner shall adjust payments to the Contractor under the applicable Item in the Contract Document based on changes to MTO's PG asphalt binder price index. The price index is published monthly and is available on the OHMPA website.
 .2 The price index is based on the price (excluding taxes, FOB depots in the Toronto area) of asphalt binder grade PG 58-28. One index shall be used to establish and calculate the payment adjustment for all grades.
 .3 The payment adjustment shall be in dollars per tonne of asphalt binder. A payment adjustment shall be established for each month of paving/surface treatment in which the price index differs by more than 5% for the price index for the month preceding the month that tenders for the Contract were opened. When the price index differential is less than 5%, there shall be no payment adjustment established for that month of paving/ surface treatment.
 .4 The payment adjustment shall apply to the quantity of asphalt binder accepted into the Work during the month for which it is established.
 .5 The payment adjustment for the month shall be calculated as follows, where: PA= Payment Adjustment for asphalt binder in dollars T= PG asphalt binder price index for month prior to tender opening P= PG asphalt binder price index for month of paving/ surface treatment Q= Quantity of Asphalt Binder in tonnes
 When P>1.05T, the Contractor receives additional payment from the Owner as follows:
 PA=(P-1.05T)xQ
 When P<0.95T, the Owner deducts from payments due the Contractor as follows:
 PA=(0.95T-P)xQ
 .6 The quantity of asphalt binder is the total for all grades of asphalt binder supplied by the Contractor. For each month in which a payment adjustment is established, the quantity of binder shall be calculated using the tonnage of asphalt concrete accepted into the Work and its corresponding asphalt binder content determined from daily storage tank measurements.
 .1 For emulsified asphalt each month in which a payment adjustment is established, the quantity of litres shall be converted into tonnes of asphalt binder using the % of residue asphalt and the specific gravity of the asphalt emulsion in use.

 ITEM: 936
 
 936.1 DESCRIPTION
 .1 This Item details the general requirements to be carried out with respect to compaction of soil, aggregate and RAP construction materials, by the Contractor.
 936.2 SOIL and AGGREGATE
 .1 All Roadbed materials shall be placed in lifts of a loose thickness not greater than that specified in the Item under which the material is excavated or supplied, and compacted to at least the specified percentage of maximum dry density uniformly throughout the lift.
 .1 Frozen materials shall not be incorporated into the Roadbed, and Roadbed materials shall not be placed on a frozen Roadbed surface without prior approval of the Engineer.
 .2 For most soils, and for Aggregate Base and Shoulder Material, the maximum dry density will be determined by ASTM D698.
 .1 If the sample used in carrying out ASTM D698 has greater than 5% but less than 30% of oversize particles (retained on the 19 mm sieve), the maximum dry density will be the corrected value determined as per ASTM D4718.
 .2 If the material being placed in the Work has a percentage of oversize particles more than 5% higher or lower than the percentage in the sample of 936.2.2.1, the maximum dry density will be the value calculated using the actual field percentage of oversize, as per ASTM D4718.
 .3 For coarse granular materials and Aggregate Subbase the maximum dry density will be determined as per ASTM D4253.
 .3 For Aggregate Base/Subbase and soil, the Contractor shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the moisture content is such that compaction is achieved in accordance with 936.2.1 and the following:
 .1 For Aggregate Base/Subbase, the moisture content shall be such that compaction is achieved without adversely breaking down or segregating the aggregate (such that its gradation falls outside the specified grading limits, as determined by sieve analyses on random samples of the compacted in-place material).
 .1 The average moisture content of Aggregate Base/Subbase shall not be less than 3% at time of compaction.
 .2 For soils placed in the top 1.2 m to Subgrade in embankments, the moisture content shall be a value not greater than the optimum moisture content as defined by ASTM D698 or the saturated moisture content as defined by ASTM D4253, and such that no rutting damage, as defined in 933.3, occurs upon completion of compaction.

 936.2 .4 The Contractor shall note that the moisture density relationship (maximum dry density optimum moisture content), and more precisely the moisture density relationship at a specified compactive effort, is a unique parameter for each soil and/or aggregate matrix considered, and the Contractor shall be responsible for the placement of the material at the appropriate moisture content for compaction efficiency.
 .1 In the event material is too dry for compaction as specified herein, the Contractor shall apply water to the area to be compacted in order to increase the moisture content of the soil or aggregate.
 .2 In the event material is too wet for compaction, as specified herein, the Contractor shall decrease the moisture content of the soil or aggregate.
 .5 The energy imparted to the soil shall be sufficient to achieve the specified density, as determined by one of the following ASTM tests: D1556, D2167 or D2922.
 .6 No subsequent lifts shall be placed until the preceding lift has been verified as meeting the minimum compaction criteria defined.
 .7 A test strip may also be used to determine a control density and the number of passes of compaction equipment required to achieve this result.
 .1 The test strip shall be performed on a lift of placed material with density tests taken after each pass of a compactor until an insitu maximum dry density (control density) is achieved. This procedure will continue until the density result remains constant or decreases. The test strip determines the maximum number of passes, control density and field moisture content.
 .2 The compaction equipment to be used for test strips shall be able to produce a uniform density throughout the lift and have a minimum mass of 9 tonne and a vibratory capacity of at least 1500 vpm.
 .1 Smaller compactors will be allowed for test strips at Culverts.
 .3 Lifts shall be compacted to a minimum of 97% of the control density.
 936.3 RAP
 .1 Compaction of RAP placed as Aggregate Subbase, Aggregate Base or shoulder material will be considered to be achieved upon completing the roller pattern approved by the Engineer.
 936.4 APPLICATION of WATER
 .1 All application of water shall be carried out in accordance with Item 191.

 .2 This Item applies to all Value Engineering Proposals initiated and developed by the Contractor and which are identified as such by the Contractor at the time of their submission to the Engineer; however, nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Engineer to approve a Value Engineering Proposal submitted hereunder.
 .3 The following information as a minimum shall be provided in the written submission of each Value Engineering Proposal:
 .1 A statement that this proposal is submitted as a Value Engineering Proposal;
 .2 A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirements and the proposed Value Engineering Proposal change;
 .3 A statement concerning the basis for the Value Engineering Proposal and benefits to the Owner together with an itemization of the Contract Items and requirements affected by the Value Engineering Proposal;
 .4 Separate detailed cost estimates for both the existing Contract requirements and the proposed Value Engineering Proposal change;
 .5 An itemization of plan details, design standards or Specifications to be changed if the Value Engineering Proposal is adopted; and
 .6 A statement of the date by which approval must be issued to obtain the total cost reduction of the Value Engineering Proposal during the remainder of Contract, noting any effect on Contract Completion Date.
 .4 The Owner shall process the Value Engineering Proposal in the same manner as prescribed for any other proposal which would necessitate issuance of a Contract Change Order.
 .1 The Owner may accept in whole or in part any Value Engineering Proposal by issuing a Change Order which shall identify the Value Engineering Proposal on which it is based.
 .2 The Owner shall not be liable to the Contractor for failure to accept or act upon any Value Engineering Proposal submitted pursuant to this provision nor for any delays to the Work attributable to any such proposal.
 .3 Until a proposal is effected by Change Order, the Contractor shall remain obligated to the terms and conditions of the existing Contract.

 .4 When an executed Change Order has not been issued by the date upon which the Contractor's proposal specifies that a decision thereon should be made, or such other date as the Contractor may subsequently have specified in writing, evaluation of the proposal shall be terminated unless the Contractor further extends the approval date.
 
 .5 The Change Order effecting the necessary Contract modification shall establish the estimated net savings agreed upon, provide for adjustment in the Contract prices and indicate that the net savings be equally divided between the Contractor and the Owner.
 
 .5 The Contractor shall absorb all costs incurred in preparing a Value Engineering Proposal for submission to the Owner. Costs incurred by the Owner in evaluating, approving or rejecting, and administering a Value Engineering Proposal shall be borne by the Owner.

 .10 The Owner expressly reserves the right to adopt a Value Engineering Proposal for general use in Contracts administered by the Owner when it determines the Value Engineering Proposal is suitable for application to other Contracts without obligation or compensation of any kind to the Contractor.
 
 .11 Proposed changes in the basic design of a Bridge or Pavement type, or changes which require different Right-of-Way limits or proposals involving Work outside the scope of the Contract, shall not normally be considered as an acceptable Value Engineering Proposal.
 
 .12 When a Value Engineering Proposal is accepted by the Owner, the provisions of Sections 2(3) and 2(4) of Article II of the Articles of Agreement pertaining to adjustment of Contract Unit Price due to alterations of Contract quantities shall not apply to the Items adjusted or deleted as a result of effecting the Value Engineering Proposal by Change Order.
 
 .13 The cost of the revised Work, as determined in the Value Engineering Proposal Change Order, shall be paid by the standard monthly Progress Estimates.
 
 .14 In addition to such payment, the Contractor shall be paid, on a Lump Sum basis by a separate Item, one half of the difference (net savings) between the cost of the original Contract Work and the final cost of the revised Work listed in the Change Order.
 
 .15 One half of the Contractor's share of the estimated net savings shall be paid to the Contractor upon approval of the Value Engineering Proposal Change Order. The remainder due to the Contractor shall be paid upon completion of all Items of Work included in the Value Engineering Proposal Change Order. The final payment shall be determined by the actual quantities for Items paid by the unit or by the Change Order amount for the lump sum Items.

 Page B 4
