 work to be performed or materials to be furnished and a schedule of pay items for which
 contract unit prices are asked; specified contract time; and instructions to bidders
 regarding proposal forms, basis of award, proposal guaranty required, plans,
 specifications, labor requirements, special provisions and other pertinent information.
 102.01--Prequalification of Bidders. Prospective bidders will be required to file with
 the Department a list of persons authorized to bind the company in all matters. Other
 information may be required from time to time before issuing proposals.

 in excess of $50,000.00 and financed 100% with State funds, the bidder must have a
 certificate of responsibility issued by the Mississippi State Board of Public Contractors or
 a similar certificate issued by another state recognizing such certificate issued by the
 State of Mississippi. The Bidder's Certificate of Responsibility number must be on file
 with the Department’s Contract Administration Division to purchase a bid proposal.
 When two or more persons, firms or corporations are submitting a joint venture, each of
 the persons, firms or corporations shall comply with the above prequalification
 requirements.
 102.02--Contents of Proposal Forms. The proposal forms, designated as Section 905 of

 request, furnish the bidder with a proposal. The Department reserves the right to refuse
 
 13
 
 Section 102
 
 Section 102
 
 to issue a proposal to a bidder for the following reasons:
 (a) Lack of competency and adequate machinery, plant, or other equipment, as
 revealed by the information obtained as provided in Subsection 102.01 or other
 determinations made by the Department.
 (b) Uncompleted work which, in the judgment of the Department, might hinder or
 prevent the prompt completion of additional work if awarded.
 (c) Failure to pay, or satisfactorily settle, all bills due for labor and material on
 former contracts in force at the time of issuance of proposals.
 (d) Unsatisfactory performance on previous contracts.
 (e) Failure to promptly reimburse the Department for any overpayment that might
 have occurred.
 (f) Debarment of a prospective bidder or any of its corporate officers or principal
 owners by the Mississippi Transportation Commission.
 102.04--Interpretation of Quantities in Bid Schedule. The quantities appearing in the
 bid schedule are approximate only and have been prepared for the comparison of bids.
 The Department does not guarantee or assume any responsibility that quantities shown on
 the plans will not vary during actual construction of the Project, and the Contractor,
 hereby acknowledging this fact, shall be precluded from claiming in the construction of
 the Project, and the Contractor shall not claim deception or misunderstanding because of
 variation in these quantities or variation from the location, character of the work, or any
 other conditions. Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of
 work performed and accepted or materials furnished and accepted in accordance with the
 Contract. The scheduled quantities of work to be done and materials to be furnished may
 each be increased, decreased, or omitted as hereinafter provided.
 102.05--Examination of Plans, Specifications, Special Provisions, Notices to Bidders
 and Site of Work. The Department intends, to the extent that the facts and
 circumstances permits, to prepare full, complete, and accurate plans and specifications
 giving directions that will enable any competent Contractor to carry them out. The
 bidder is required to examine carefully the site of the proposed work, the proposal, Plans,
 Standard Specifications, Special Provisions, Notices to Bidders and contract forms before
 submitting a proposal. The submission of a bid shall be considered prima facie evidence
 that the bidder has made such an examination and is satisfied as to the conditions to be
 encountered in performing the work and as to the requirements of the plans, Standard
 Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, Notices to Bidders, Special Provisions,
 Contract, and the Federal, State, and local laws that will in any way affect the execution
 of the work. All Contracts are subject to the provisions of Sections 65-1-89 and 65-1-91,
 Mississippi Code of 1972, annotated.
 Bidders may inspect records of the Department as to investigations made, subject to the
 conditions set forth herein.
 Boring logs and other records of subsurface investigations are available for inspection by
 bidders. It is understood that such information was obtained and is intended for
 Department design and estimating purposes only. It is made available to bidders so they
 may have access to identical subsurface information available to the Department and is
 not intended as a substitute for personal investigation, interpretations and judgment of the
 bidders. No representations are made by the Department concerning the results of any
 subsurface investigation as a result of providing any such information to Bidders and the
 
 14
 
 Section 102
 
 Section 102
 
 Department and the Commission shall not be liable for any errors or omissions in the
 boring logs or other records of subsurface investigations provided.
 The Department makes no guarantees regarding the character or extent of water levels,
 soil, rock, or other subsurface conditions the bidder may encounter during the work. The
 Department interpolates test data from completed borings in its reports and
 representations of subsurface conditions, and does not guarantee the accuracy of these
 interpolations, nor does the Department guarantee the accuracy of the test data except at
 the exact points where samples were taken. The Department requires bidders to make
 their own evaluation of subsurface conditions and to determine how these conditions may
 affect the methods and cost of construction. Material quality within sources naturally
 varies.
 The bidder shall immediately notify the Department of any apparent error, omission, or
 ambiguity in any part of the proposal. The Department will review the apparent error,
 omission, or ambiguity, and will issue a notice to all prospective bidders, as appropriate.
 If the Department becomes aware of a change in the information provided at any time
 during the bidding process, it will provide reasonable notice of the new information to the
 bidders.
 In order to make the most effective use of available engineering personnel, the
 Department is unable to assign engineering responsibilities at the time of Contract
 preparation; however, the District Construction Engineer will, by appointment, personally
 be available or may arrange for representative to be available to lend assistance to
 prospective bidders for plan-in-hand review of the proposed work features, and, if
 desirable, field inspection of the site of the proposed work. The Resident or Project
 Engineer for the Contract will be assigned as soon as the Department can reasonably
 make an appropriate determination.

 online using the Bid Express Service (BIDX).
 The Bidder’s complete proposal (Certification of Performance, Certification Regarding
 Non-Collusion, etc.) will be submitted to the Department electronically via the Bid
 Express Service no later than the day and at the time bids are to be received. Bidders will
 be responsible for joining Bid Express and getting all necessary clearances and a digital
 ID in sufficient time for Bid Express to submit their bid.
 Bid Express files shall be downloaded from http://www.bidx.com. Bidders are to select
 Mississippi Department of Transportation under the U.S. AGENCY drop down menu and
 select the desired project. After completing all necessary data, the Bidders shall submit
 their bid to Bid Express in sufficient time for the bid to be properly sent to the
 Department.
 Bids submitted via the Bid Express Service will constitute the official bid and shall be
 digitally signed and delivered to the Department by the Bid Express Service.
 It is the responsibility of every bidder to check for any addendum or modification to the
 contract document(s) for which they intend to submit a response. It shall be the bidder’s
 responsibility to be sure they are in receipt of all addenda, pre-bid conference
 
 15

 Section 102
 
 information, and/or questions and answers provided at, or subsequent to, the pre-bid
 conference, if any are issued.
 The Commission has no responsibility for defects, irregularities or other problems caused
 by the use of electronic media. Operation of this electronic media is done at the sole risk
 of the user.
 When the bid schedule contains a fixed contract unit price (FCP) for an item, this price
 shall be the contract unit price for the item and no alteration shall be made by the bidder.
 When an item in the proposal contains a choice to be made by the bidder, the bidder shall
 indicate the choice in accordance with the INSTRUCTION TO BIDDERS in Section 905
 - Proposal; reference is made to Alternate Designs, Alternate Items, and Optional Items
 as defined in Subsection 101.02.
 Where the bid schedule lists alternate designs or alternate items, the one alternate bid
 shall be designated by bidding only that alternate, and thereafter no further choice will be
 permitted.
 When the bid schedule lists optional items, the Contractor's selection may, but is not
 required to, be made at the time of bidding. For optional items not pre-selected, the
 Contractor's selection shall be made prior to or at the time of execution of the Contract.
 Each proposal issued will contain a Certification regarding debarment, suspension, and
 other responsibility matters to be completed by the bidder. The Certification must be
 sworn to and shall be under penalty of perjury and bidders are cautioned to read and
 understand its contents in entirety before digitally signing the bid.
 The Contractor shall provide immediate written notice to the Contract Administration
 Engineer at any time, prior to or after award, that an e-certification was erroneous when
 executed or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
 Failure on the part of the bidder to execute the Certification will result in the proposal
 being rejected.
 The bidder's proposal must be digitally signed by the individual, by one or more members
 of the partnership, by one or more members or officers of each firm representing a joint
 venture, or by one or more officers of a corporation, or by an agent of the Contractor
 legally qualified to bind the Contractor and acceptable to the State. If the proposal is
 made by an individual, the individual’s name and address must be shown; by a
 partnership, the name and address of each partnership member must be shown; as a joint
 venture, the name and address of each member or officer of the firms represented by the
 joint venture must be shown; by a corporation, the name of the corporation and the
 business address of its corporate officials must be shown.
 The address stated on the proposal shall be the bidder's permanent address until changed
 by written notice to the Executive Director. All notices provided for in the Contract shall
 be considered as delivered to the Contractor when mailed or delivered to such address.
 102.07--Irregular Proposals. Proposals will be considered irregular and may be
 rejected for any of the following reasons:
 
 16
 
 Section 102
 
 Section 102
 
 (a) If the proposal is on a form other than that furnished by the Department, or if the
 form is altered or any part thereof is detached, except as allowed in Subsection
 102.06.
 (b) If there are unauthorized additions, conditional or alternate bids, or irregularities
 of any kind that may tend to make the proposal incomplete, indefinite, or
 ambiguous as to its meaning.
 (c) If the bidder adds any provisions reserving the right to accept or reject an award,
 or to enter into a Contract pursuant to an award.
 (d) If the proposal does not contain a contract unit price and extension for each pay
 item, except in the case of alternate items and when the unit of measurement is
 lump sum.
 (e) If the proposal, Section 905, does not contain acknowledgement of receipt and
 addition to the proposal and contract documents of all addenda issued prior to
 opening of bids.
 (f) Failure to execute required affidavits, certificates, etc., and furnish proposal
 guaranty.
 (g) The Commission reserves the right, for any reason, to reject any or all proposals,
 to waive technicalities or irregularities, or to advertise for new proposals, and the
 decision of the Commission to reject any bid or proposal shall not be cause for any
 liability or damage against the Commission, the Department, or any of its officers
 or employees.
 (h) The Department may reject a proposal if any of the unit prices contained therein
 appear to be mathematically unbalanced, by reason that they are either above or
 below the Engineer’s estimate. A mathematically unbalanced bid generates a
 reasonable doubt that award to the Bidder submitting a mathematically unbalanced
 bid will result in the lowest ultimate cost to the Department.
 102.08--Proposal Guaranty. No proposal will be considered unless accompanied by
 certified check, cashier's check or bid bond, made payable to the State of Mississippi, in
 an amount of not less than five percent (5%) of the total amount of the proposal offered.
 The proposal guaranty shall be evidence of good faith that, if awarded the Contract, the
 bidder will execute the Contract and give performance and payment contract bond(s) as
 stipulated in Subsection 103.05.1, 103.05.2, and as required by law.
 If a bid bond is offered as guaranty, the bond must be on a form approved by the
 Executive Director, made by a Surety acceptable to the Executive Director and signed or
 countersigned by a Mississippi Agent or Qualified Nonresident Agent and the Bidder.
 The Mississippi agent or qualified nonresident agent shall be in good standing and
 licensed, at the time of submission of the bid, by the Insurance Commissioner of the State
 of Mississippi to represent the Surety company(ies) executing the bonds. Such bid bond
 shall also conform to the requirements and conditions stipulated in Subsection 103.05.2
 as applicable.
 102.09--Delivery of Proposals. Unless otherwise specified, each proposal shall be
 submitted online using Bid Express service. Proposal Forms are non-transferable and no
 name or names of interested parties may be shown other than those to whom the proposal
 was issued. All proposals shall be submitted to Bid Express prior to the time and place
 specified in the Notice to Contractors and on the Bid Express website.
 102.10--Withdrawal or Revision of Proposals. A bidder may withdraw or revise a
 
 17
 
 Section 102
 
 Section 102
 
 proposal after it has been submitted to Bid Express any time prior to the time set for
 opening proposals.
 102.11--Combination Bids. Combination bids that combine two or more individual
 projects may be submitted by stating in writing on each project proposal to be considered
 in the combination, one of the following:
 (a) That the bidder is bidding on "All or None" of the work for designated
 proposals. The Department will evaluate all bids on these proposals and make
 awards based on the bids most advantageous to the State.
 (b) The reduction the bidder will make in the contract unit price of one or more of
 the items in any or all of the proposals if awarded the combination; however, the
 bidder will not be permitted to make a reduction in any contract unit price that
 may be fixed by the Department in the proposal. The Department will select
 from the proposals submitted the individual or combination bids most
 advantageous to the State.
 (c) That the bidder is bidding on a number of projects but desires to be awarded
 work not to exceed a specified total amount or a specified number of Contracts.
 The Department will select from the bidder’s proposal those that are most
 advantageous to the State within its specified amount or total number of
 Contracts.
 Combination bids that state that a lump sum shall be deducted from the final estimate, or
 that a reduction in prices shall be made on a percentage basis, or that states that award of
 a Contract is contingent upon being awarded another Contract will not be accepted and
 the bids with which such a letter is submitted will be considered irregular and rejected.
 102.12--Public Opening of Bids. All bids received in accordance with the terms of the
 advertisement shall be publicly opened and announced either item by item, or by total
 amount, at the time and place indicated in the proposal. If any bid received is not read
 aloud, the name of the Bidder and the reason for not reading the bid aloud shall be
 publicly announced at the letting. Bidders, their authorized agents, and other interested
 parties are invited to be present.
 102.13--Disqualification of Bidders. Either of the following reasons may be considered
 as being sufficient for the disqualification of a bidder and the rejection of the bidder’s
 proposal or proposals:
 (a) More than one proposal for the same work from an individual, partnership, firm
 or corporation under the same or different name(s). However, the Commission
 may accept proposals on construction contracts from commonly owned but
 independently managed companies, so long as each bid is not the result of
 collusion and is accompanied by the required certificate regarding collusion.
 (b) Evidence of collusion among bidders. Participants in such collusion will receive
 no recognition as bidders for any future work of the Department until reinstated
 as a qualified bidder.
 102.14--Material Guaranty. At the option of the Department, the successful bidder
 shall be required at any time before or after the award or execution of the Contract to
 furnish a complete statement of the origin, composition and manufacture of any or all
 materials to be used in the construction of the work and shall provide the Department
 
 18
 
 Section 102
 
 Section 102
 
 with access to all sources of materials for sampling and testing to determine their quality,
 uniformity and fitness for the work in accordance with the Contract.
 102.15--Questions Regarding Bidding. All questions that arise regarding the contract
 documents (proposal), plans, or addendum shall be directed to the www.gomdot.com
 current letting webpage. Click on the call number for the project to open an email form
 to submit your question. Questions must be submitted by 8:00 a.m. on the day prior to
 the letting. Answers to questions will be posted by 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to the
 letting. Answers can be viewed by clicking on Q&A link under the Proposal Addenda
 column.
 It shall be the Bidders responsibility to familiarize themselves with the questions and
 answers that have been submitted on a particular project. By signing the contract
 documents for a project, the Bidder agrees that the on-line Questions and Answers
 submitted on the project shall be added to and made part of the Contract.
 
 SECTION 103 - AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 103.01--Consideration of Proposals. After the proposals are opened and read, they will
 be compared on the basis of the summation of the products of the quantities shown in the
 bid schedule and the contract unit prices bid. The results of comparisons will be
 immediately available to the public. In the event of a discrepancy between any contract
 unit price and its extension, the contract unit price shall govern.
 Resident Contractors actually domiciled in Mississippi are to be granted preference over
 nonresidents in awarding of Contracts financed 100% with State funds as provided
 herein.
 In consideration of proposals that are equal to or in excess of $50,000 and financed 100%
 with State funds, a nonresident bidder domiciled in a state having laws granting
 preference to local Contractors will be considered for such contracts on the same basis as
 the nonresident bidder's state awards contracts to Mississippi Contractors bidding under
 similar circumstances. When a nonresident Contractor submits a bid equal to or in excess
 of $50,000 on a contract financed 100% with State funds, a copy of the current laws from
 the state of domicile and an explanation thereof pertaining to treatment of nonresident
 Contractors shall be attached. If no preferential treatment is provided for Contractors in
 the state of domicile and contracts are awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, a
 statement to this effect shall be attached. Should the attachment not accompany the bid
 when submitted, the Contractor shall have 10 days following the opening of the bids to
 furnish the required information to the Contract Administration Engineer for attachment
 to the bid. As used herein, the term "resident Contractors" includes a nonresident person,
 firm or corporation that has been qualified to do business in this State and has maintained
 a permanent full-time office in the State of Mississippi for two years prior to January 1,
 1986, and the subsidiaries and affiliates of such a person, firm or corporation.
 103.02--Award of Contract. The award of a Contract will be made within 60 calendar
 days after the opening of proposals to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder,
 except as provided in Subsection 103.01 for preferential treatment situations, whose
 proposal complies with all the requirements prescribed. The award of Contracts
 involving the expenditure of Federal funds is contingent upon concurrence of the Federal
 
 19
 
 Section 103
 
 Section 103
 
 Agency whose funds are being used. The successful bidder will be notified of the award
 by letter mailed to the address shown on the proposal.
 103.03--Cancellation of Award. The Department reserves the right to cancel the award
 of a Contract for any reason, any time prior to the execution by all parties without
 liability against the Commission, Department, or any of its officers or employees.
 103.04--Return of Proposal Guaranty. The proposal guaranty of each bidder, except
 those of the two lowest responsive bidders, will be returned within 10 days of Contract
 award. The retained proposal guaranty of the unsuccessful of the two lowest responsive
 bidders will be returned within ten days following the execution of a Contract with the
 successful low responsive bidder. The retained proposal guaranty of the successful
 bidder will be returned after satisfactory performance and payment bonds have been
 furnished and the Contract has been executed.
 In the event all bids are rejected by the Commission, certified checks or cashier's checks
 submitted as a proposal guaranty by all bidders will be returned within 10 days of
 rejection.
 In the event no award is made within 30 days after the opening of bids, the Executive
 Director may permit the successful bidder to replace the certified check or cashier's check
 with a satisfactory bidder's bond.
 Should no award be made within 60 calendar days, all proposals will be deemed rejected
 and all proposal guaranties returned unless the lowest responsive and responsible bidder,
 at the request of the Commission, agrees in writing to a longer delay prior to the
 execution of the 60 days.
 103.05--Contract Bonds.
 103.05.1--Requirement of Contract Bonds. Prior to the execution of the Contract, the
 successful bidder shall execute and deliver to the Executive Director a performance and
 payment bond(s) in the form required by the Commission and in a sum equal to the full
 amount of the Contract as a guaranty for complete and full performance of the Contract
 and the protection of the appropriate claimants and the Department for materials and
 equipment and full payment of wages in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. § 65-1-85(as
 amended). In the event of the award of a joint venture, each individual, partnership, firm
 or corporation shall assume jointly the full obligations under the executed Contract,
 executed Supplemental Agreements, and the contract bond(s).
 103.05.2--Form of Bonds. The form of bond(s) shall be that provided by the Contract.
 These bonds shall be executed by a Mississippi agent or qualified nonresident agent and
 shall be accompanied by a certification as to authorization of the attorney-in-fact to
 commit the Surety company. A power of attorney exhibiting the Surety's original seal
 supporting the Mississippi agent or the qualified nonresident agent's signature shall be
 furnished with each bond. The Surety company shall be currently authorized and
 licensed in good standing to conduct business in the State of Mississippi with a minimum
 rating by A.M. Best of (A-) in the latest printing of "Best's Key Rating Guide" to write
 individual bonds up to ten percent of the policy holders' surplus or listed on the current
 list of “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal
 Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies” as published by the United States
 
 20
 
 Section 103
 
 Section 103
 
 Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Circular 570 (latest revision
 as published and supplemented on the Financial Management Service web site and in the
 Federal Register) within the underwriting limits listed for that Surety. The Mississippi
 agent or qualified nonresident agent shall be in good standing and currently licensed by
 the Insurance Commissioner of the State to represent the Surety company(ies) executing
 the bonds.
 Surety bonds shall continue to be acceptable to the Commission throughout the life of the
 Contract and shall not be canceled by the Surety without the consent of the Department.
 In the event the Surety fails or becomes financially insolvent, the Contractor shall file a
 new bond in the amount designated by the Executive Director within thirty (30) days of
 such failure, insolvency, or bankruptcy. Subsequent to award of Contract, the
 Commission or the Department may require additional security for any Supplemental
 Agreements executed under the Contract or replacement security in the event of the
 surety(ies)’s loss of the ratings required above. Suits concerning bonds shall be filed in
 the State and adjudicated under its laws without reference to conflict of laws principles.
 103.06--Blank.
 103.07--Execution and Approval of Contract. The successful bidder to whom the
 Contract has been awarded shall sign and file with the Executive Director the Contract
 and all documents required by the Contract within 10 days after the Contract has been
 mailed or otherwise provided to the bidder. The Contract may require certain documents
 be submitted at an earlier date, in which case, those documents shall be submitted within
 the time frame specified. If the Contract is not executed by the Department within 15
 days following receipt of the signed Contract and all necessary documents, the bidder
 shall have the right to withdraw the bid without penalty. No Contract is in effect until it
 is executed by all parties.
 103.08--Failure to Execute Contract. Failure of the bidder to execute the Contract and
 file acceptable performance and payment bonds and/or other required documents within
 10 days shall be just cause for the cancellation of the award and forfeiture of the proposal
 guaranty, which shall become the property of the Department, not as a penalty but in
 liquidation of damages sustained. Award may then be made to the next lowest
 responsive and responsible bidder, or the work may be re-advertised at the discretion of
 the Department.
 
 SECTION 104 - SCOPE OF WORK

 Follow-up workshops may be held periodically throughout the duration of the Contract as
 agreed by the Contractor and the Department.
 The establishment of a partnership charter on a project will not change the legal
 relationship of the parties to the Contract nor relieve either party from any of the terms of
 the Contract.
 104.01.1.3--Informal Partnering. If the Contractor and the Department do not choose
 to have a Formal Partnering process or the Contract does not require a Mandatory Formal
 Partnering process, an informal partnering meeting shall be conducted on at least a
 monthly basis. It will be mandatory that the Project Engineer and Project Superintendent
 attend the meeting. It is recommended that Department Inspectors, foremen, and other
 project managers attend the meeting.
 The Project Engineer will be responsible for taking minutes of the meeting. As soon as
 practical after the meeting, the Engineer will send a copy of the minutes of the meeting to
 
 22
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 the Contractor, District Construction Engineer, and State Construction Engineer. The
 Contractor will have 30 days to dispute the contents of the minutes before the minutes
 become an official record of the project.
 104.02--Alterations of Plans or Character of Work. Except as may be necessary to
 satisfactorily complete the Contract, no alterations of the plans or the nature of the work
 will involve work beyond the termini of the contemplated construction without
 modification of the Contract and approval by all parties concerned.
 The Department reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work, such
 changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily
 complete the project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall neither invalidate
 the Contract nor release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as
 altered.
 Wherever in the Specifications a Supplemental Agreement is provided for, such
 Supplemental Agreement may be subject to the approval of the Commission and spread
 upon its minutes prior to execution by the Executive Director.
 104.02.1--Significant Changes in the Character of Work. Before any consideration
 will be given for an alteration or quantity adjustment, it must be determined that a
 significant change in the character of the work has occurred. A significant change in
 quantity of a major item, plus or minus twenty-five percent (25%) variation from original
 quantity, in and of itself, does not constitute a significant change in the character of the
 work. The character of the work, as altered, must differ materially in kind or nature from
 that involved or included in the original proposed construction.
 If a proposed alteration or quantity adjustment significantly changes the character of the
 work under the Contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves
 significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such
 other work to become significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding
 anticipated profit, will be made to the Contract. The basis for the adjustment shall be
 agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then
 an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the
 Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable.
 If the proposed alteration or quantity adjustment does not significantly change the
 character of the work to be performed under the Contract, the altered work will be paid
 for as provided elsewhere in the Contract.
 The term "significant change" shall be construed to apply only to the following
 circumstances:
 1.
 2.
 
 When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature
 from that involved or included in the original proposed construction, or
 If a major contract item of work is increased in excess of 125 percent or
 decreased below 75 percent of the original contract quantity. Any allowance for
 an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 percent
 of original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 percent, to
 the actual amount of work performed.
 
 23
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 Items, quantities, unit prices and amounts, or revisions thereof, established in the
 Contract by Supplemental Agreement shall be considered as original contract items,
 quantities, prices, amounts and totals thereof.
 When a major contract item is eliminated, the Contractor will be reimbursed for
 substantiated unrecovered overhead costs but not to exceed five percent of the original
 contract value of the item. The Contractor shall not be entitled to recover nor shall the
 Commission, the Department, or any of its officers or employees be subjected to any
 liability or damages for the elimination of any major contract item.
 The Contractor upon request will be paid substantiated actual costs for materials, that are
 in excess of those used and paid for in the completed work that were mobilized prior to
 notification of elimination or reduction of a major contract item. Materials that otherwise
 would have been required prior to such notification that are on order and that cannot be
 cancelled may be included in the materials to be paid for by the Department. No
 payment will be allowed for materials in excess of the quantity required under the
 Contract.
 Points of delivery for the reimbursed materials shall be agreeable to the Department. The
 Contractor shall make delivery at such point and the additional transportation cost, if any,
 will be reimbursed by the Department.
 Mobilization of materials as indicated in this provision shall be understood to be
 materials that qualify for partial payment under the provisions of Subsection 109.06, and
 cannot be reasonably used by the Contractor in other work under Contract.
 At the option of the Department, living or perishable plant materials, seeds, other
 materials and warehouse items mobilized for the work may be purchased by the
 Department.
 All mobilized materials for which payment is made shall become the property of the
 Department, and the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer satisfactory title or other
 approved evidence of ownership.
 104.02.2--Differing Site Conditions. During the progress of the work, if subsurface or
 latent physical conditions are encountered at the site differing materially from those
 indicated in the Contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature,
 differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as
 inherent in the work provided for in the Contract, are encountered at the site, the party
 discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the
 specific differing conditions before the site is disturbed and before the affected work is
 performed.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if it is
 determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the
 cost or time required for the performance of any work under the Contract, an adjustment,
 excluding anticipated profits, will be made and the Contract modified in writing
 accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not
 an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed
 
 24
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice. The written notice shall
 be submitted upon the forms provided and required by the Department.
 Before beginning or continuing work that justifies an adjustment of the contract unit price
 or contract time under the above provisions, a Supplemental Agreement acceptable to all
 parties shall be executed. In the event an agreement acceptable to all parties cannot be
 reached, the Department may order the work to proceed and that part of the work will be
 paid for in accordance with Subsection 109.04.
 If the altered or added work is of a character as to require more than the normal time to
 complete the work, an adjustment of the contract time may be made.
 104.02.3--Minor Alterations to the Contract. When the Department makes alterations
 in the details of construction or specifications that are minor in nature, the Resident or
 Project Engineer may elect to make an adjustment to the Contract under the provisions of
 this subsection. Minor alterations shall be defined as those alterations to the Contract that
 are not addressed in the Standard Specifications, or Supplements thereto, and are valued
 at less than $10,000.00. The District Engineer shall designate, in writing, the Resident or
 Project Engineer authorized to execute the Class I Supplemental Agreement. The
 Resident or Project Engineer and Contractor shall agree upon the scope of work and a
 lump sum amount, within the above stated limit, for the work to be performed. The
 agreement shall be reflected in a Class I Supplemental Agreement signed by the Resident
 or Project Engineer and the Contractor's authorized representative, which, when it bears
 both the signature of the Resident or Project Engineer and Contractor, shall constitute the
 scope of work and the sole and only basis for payment by the Department or Commission
 under the item "Minor Alterations to the Contract." Work shall not proceed until both
 parties sign the agreement.
 Any adjustment of contract time due to Minor Alterations will be in accordance with
 Subsection 108.06 of the Standard Specifications.
 Payment will be made under:
 104-A S/A: Minor Alterations to the Contract
 
 - lump sum
 
 104.02.4–Contract Change Notifications. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to
 provide reasonable written notice when conditions are believed to require a change to the
 Contract. The Department will only consider requests for changes to the Contract when
 the Contractor meets the notification procedures specified in this Subsection.
 A. Written Notification by Contractor. The Contractor shall provide immediate
 written notification to the Engineer upon discovering a condition that may require
 a change to the Contract. The following detailed information shall be provided to
 the Engineer, in writing, within 14 calendar days of the Contractor’s written
 notification:
 1.
 2.
 
 A description of the condition, including the time and date first identified, and
 the location, if appropriate.
 An explanation of why the condition represents a change to the Contract, with
 references made to Subsection 104.02 and other pertinent portions of the
 Contract.
 
 25
 
 Section 104
 3.
 
 Section 104
 
 A statement of all changes considered necessary to the Contract price(s),
 delivery schedule(s), phasing, and time. Because of its preliminary nature, the
 Department recognizes that this information may rely on estimates.
 
 After notifying the Engineer, the Contractor shall continue to perform the work
 under the Contract including the work subject to the condition. The Contractor
 shall maintain records of actual labor, equipment and materials used in accordance
 with Subsection 109.04 for the work subject to the condition.
 B. Written Acknowledgement by Engineer. The Engineer will provide a written
 response within seven (7) calendar days of receiving the initial notification.
 C. Written Response by Engineer. The Engineer will provide a written response
 within 21 calendar days of receiving the Contractor’s detailed notification that
 includes one of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 A confirmation that a change is necessary in accordance with Subsection
 104.02, and direction on how the Work will proceed.
 A denial of the request for a change, which will include references to the
 Contract as to why the condition does not represent a change.
 A request for additional information stating the specific information needed
 and the date by which it must be received. The Department will respond to
 the additional information provided within 14 calendar days.
 
 When a change is necessary, the Engineer will make appropriate adjustments to the
 Contract price and time, if warranted, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
 Contract. If the Contractor disagrees with the Engineer’s decision or does not agree with
 the Contract adjustments, the Contractor may pursue the issue as a claim in accordance
 with Subsection 105.17.
 104.03--Extra Work. The Contractor shall perform unforeseen work, for which there is
 no price included in the Contract, whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable by the
 Engineer in order to complete fully the work as contemplated. Such work shall be
 performed in accordance with the applicable specifications and as directed. Payment or
 adjustment in payment will be made as provided under Subsection 109.04.
 104.04--Maintenance of Traffic.
 Unless otherwise provided, the road under
 construction and all other roads and entrances to adjacent property within the right-ofway will be kept open to through and local traffic. The Contractor must maintain all
 traffic control features over the section of road under construction in accordance with the
 plans, MUTCD, and Section 618 of these specifications.
 The Contractor shall keep the portion of the project being used by public traffic in
 satisfactory condition for traffic to be adequately accommodated. The Contractor shall
 also provide and maintain in a safe condition temporary approaches or crossings and
 intersections with trails, roads, streets, businesses, parking lots, residences, garages, and
 farms. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Department to allow MDOT personnel or
 MDOT representatives, FHWA, and other governmental agencies to access the
 construction site to perform inspections at any time deemed appropriate.
 In any area where traffic is maintained, mowing shall be performed as necessary and as
 
 26
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 determined by the Engineer to provide reasonable appearance and safety to the traveling
 public. Mowing shall be performed at the direction and satisfaction of the Engineer, and
 shall include those areas from the edge of the pavement to a minimum of five feet beyond
 the shoulder line. The cost of mowing shall be absorbed in other contract items when the
 Contract does not contain a bid item for mowing, and shall not be the basis for any
 additional payment.
 It may become necessary for the Contractor to sweep the roadway surface to completely
 remove debris from pavement surfaces and other areas designated on the plans or
 directed by the Engineer. Collected debris shall be disposed of off the right-of-way in
 accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. Debris is defined as dirt, trash, and
 other matter not part of the highway facility.
 In case it is necessary or desirable to close a portion of the project to traffic, the plans,
 special provisions, or other contract documents will so indicate, or if provisions are not
 made on the plans or in other contract documents, the Engineer may permit in writing the
 temporary closure of small portions of the project as deemed necessary to expedite the
 work without compromising the convenience and safety of traffic.
 The Contractor shall be bound by the provisions of this subsection and other applicable
 provisions of these specifications and the Contract with regard to the safe and convenient
 passage of traffic.
 In the case of a project for improvements or construction alongside an existing roadway
 on which traffic is required to be maintained, no equipment, vehicles or materials will be
 permitted to park or be stored within the clear/safety zone of the roadway unless it is
 behind a lane or shoulder closure. Unless working under an approved night time
 operation, the Contractor shall not perform any work within the clear/safety zone of the
 roadway between sunset and sunrise.
 The Contractor shall not obstruct any traffic facility or connection thereto that is
 officially opened to public or private traffic or required under the Contract to be
 maintained except as permitted in writing by the Engineer on the basis that other suitable
 provisions have been made.
 Due to accident possibilities for certain days of peak traffic use, the right is hereby
 reserved for the District Engineer to suspend upon due notice to the Contractor any
 operation that, if allowed to be carried on, would seriously jeopardize the safety of the
 traveling public on holidays, the preceding day, and the following day or on days of
 major public events in the general area. In the event that a holiday or major public event
 falls during a weekend or on a Monday, no operations will be allowed during that
 weekend or the Friday immediately preceding that holiday or major public event. The
 notice will specifically state the date(s) of the suspension. When work is suspended as
 provided herein, contract time will be adjusted accordingly. Additional compensation
 will not be paid because of such suspension.
 The Contractor will not be directly compensated for constructing, maintaining and
 removing temporary traffic maintenance facilities unless:
 (a) the proposal contains pay items specifically covering such work, or
 (b) the plans or other contract documents specifically indicate that quantities
 
 27
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 involved are to be measured for payment.
 The Contractor will be paid for work required to restore and/or maintain traffic that is
 caused by snow, ice, major flooding, landslide or phenomenon of nature such as an
 earthquake, hurricane, tornado, etc. when damage from such cause is beyond the control
 of and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.
 If the Engineer orders special maintenance of traffic over and above the requirements
 specified in the Contract for the benefit of the traveling public, the ordered work shall be
 accomplished as provided in Subsection 104.03 -- Extra Work.
 Unsatisfactory maintenance of traffic shall be subject to the procedures provided in
 Subsection 105.15.
 104.05--Removal and Disposal of All Materials From the Project. The Contractor
 shall remove and dispose of all existing structures and obstructions in accordance with
 the provisions of Section 202. In the event separate pay items are not provided, the cost
 of removal and disposal shall be included in prices bid for items under Sections 201 and
 203.
 The Contractor shall not remove or disturb any buildings, public utilities or other
 improvements that are to be removed and/or replaced by the Department or owners under
 separate agreement.
 It is anticipated that obstructions to be removed by the Department or owners will be
 removed and disposed of in advance of construction operations, but in the event there are
 improvements or other properties retained by the property owner, the Contractor shall not
 interfere with this property until notified in writing by the Engineer that the rights of the
 property owner have expired.
 Delays in the work occasioned by removal or non-removal by the owner will be
 considered as attributable to the State under the provisions of the Contract for the
 determination and extension of contract time, but any such delays shall not entitle the
 Contractor to nor shall such delays justify or be the basis for any monetary damages
 against the Commission, Department or any of its officers or employees.
 Upon notification by the Engineer that the property owner's rights have expired, the
 Contractor shall proceed to remove and dispose of structures and obstructions in
 accordance with this subsection and other applicable provisions of the Contract.
 All existing structures and obstructions or residual portions of structures and obstructions
 not designated to remain are to be removed by the Contractor.
 Improvements designated for removal are for the Contractor's information only, and the
 lack of such designation shall not relieve the Contractor of the removal obligation.
 When the contract documents indicate the removal of any materials, and disposal of said
 materials is permitted at locations provided by the Contractor, the Contractor shall
 furnish the Engineer a copy of a release from each property owner for the servitude of the
 land. Prior to disposal of any materials, the Contractor shall also furnish the Engineer a
 certified letter stating that the area of disposal is not in a wetland, Waters of the U.S., or
 
 28
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 any other environmentally sensitive area (ESA). The State, the Commission, the
 Department, and any of its officers and/or employees will have no ownership or liability
 whatsoever for materials or matter removed.
 All removals by the Contractor are to be made in accordance with the provisions of
 Section 201, Section 202 and Section 203.
 104.06--Use of Materials Found in the Work. It is understood that the title to all
 materials found within the right-of-way or easements remains with the State. However,
 the Engineer may permit the Contractor to use stone, gravel, sand and other suitable
 materials found within the grading limits that may be useful in fulfillment of the Contract
 requirements. The Contractor will be paid both for the excavation of the material at the
 contract unit price for excavation and for the pay item for which the excavation material
 is acceptably used. The excavation material, so removed and needed for use in
 embankments, backfills, approaches, or otherwise in the work, shall be replaced by the
 Contractor with other material acceptable to the Engineer all at no additional cost to the
 State. No charge for the material so used will be made against the Contractor. The
 Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material from within the highway location
 that is not within the grading limits established by slope stakes without prior written
 authorization from the Engineer. The Contractor will not be paid for excavation outside
 the grading limits or below original ground in fill sections.
 Unless otherwise provided, material removed from existing structures may be used
 temporarily by the Contractor. Material designated to be salvaged shall not be cut or
 otherwise damaged.
 104.07--Final Cleaning Up. Before acceptance and final payment will be made, all
 areas within the right-of-way shall be cleaned of all rubbish, temporary buildings and
 structures, equipment and excess materials. Salvaged or excess materials expressly
 reserved by the Engineer for use by the State shall be neatly stockpiled at locations
 designated. All property occupied or affected by the Contractor and all parts of the work
 shall be left in a manner acceptable to the Engineer with all waterways unobstructed.
 Prior to final inspection for release of maintenance, all areas of the work that have
 developed an undesirable growth of vegetation shall be given a final mowing, and all
 undesirable bushes, high grasses and weeds shall be cut and disposed of or sprayed as
 directed by the Engineer. The cost of mowing shall be absorbed in other contract items
 when the Contract does not contain a bid item for mowing and shall not be the basis for
 any additional payment.
 104.08--Value Engineering Incentive. Value Engineering Incentive applies to any cost
 reduction proposal initiated and developed by the Contractor for the purpose of refining
 the contract documents so as to contribute to design cost effectiveness or significantly
 improve the quality of the final product. This subsection does not apply unless a proposal
 is identified by the Contractor at the time of submission as a Value Engineering Incentive
 Proposal. The Department shall be the sole judge of the acceptability of any such
 proposal and of the estimated net savings in construction costs from adoption of all or
 any part of such proposal.
 Cost reduction proposals approved by the Department are to be implemented by a
 Supplemental Agreement to the Contract and must result in savings without impairing
 
 29
 
 Section 104
 
 Section 104
 
 any essential functions and characteristics such as safety, service life, reliability,
 economy of operations, ease of maintenance, aesthetics and necessary standard design
 features. Proposed changes in the basic design requirements of a bridge or of a pavement
 system will not normally be given consideration as a Value Engineering Incentive
 Proposal. The mere substitution of one contract item for another contract item or
 substitution of any other item for which the Department has previously established a pay
 item will not be allowed as value engineering nor will a submittal based on the use of
 material from the right-of-way.
 As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the Contractor with each
 proposal:
 (a) A statement that the proposal is submitted as a Value Engineering Incentive
 Proposal.
 (b) Description of the proposal.
 (c) Discuss Contract requirements that require modification and present a
 recommendation for each change.
 (d) An estimate of cost reductions.
 (e) Prediction of any effects on other costs to the Department.
 (f) State when the Supplemental Agreement must be executed to obtain maximum
 cost reduction during the remainder of the Contract and the reasons thereof.
 (g) A statement as to any effect on the project completion date.
 The Commission, the Department and/or any of its officers or employees will not be
 liable for any delay in acting upon a proposal. The decision of the Engineer as to
 acceptance of any such proposal will be final and not be subject to Subsection 105.17.
 The Department may accept the proposal, in whole or in part, by executing a
 Supplemental Agreement that specifically states that it is executed pursuant to these
 provisions. Such agreement should incorporate the changes or additions to the plans and
 specifications that are necessary to permit the proposal or accepted part thereof to be put
 into effect. If conditional, the agreement should include conditions upon which the
 Department's approval is based. The agreement should also set forth the estimated net
 savings attributable to the proposal and provide that the Contractor be paid 50 percent of
 said savings. The cost to the Department in evaluating the proposal will be considered in
 determining the estimated net savings. The Contractor's share of the savings shall
 constitute full compensation for the Value Engineering Incentive Proposal.
 Approval of the proposal and performance of the work thereof shall not change the
 contract completion date unless specifically provided for in the Supplemental Agreement
 implementing the proposal.
 The Contractor may request that the Department not use or disclose the information
 submitted with a proposal and such request may be honored to the extent allowed by law.
 Such restriction must be in writing and submitted with the proposal. If the proposal is
 accepted, this restriction shall be void and the Department may use, duplicate or disclose
 any data necessary to utilize such proposal. The executed Supplemental Agreement
 implementing the proposal will become public information in the files of the Department.
 This incentive provision applies only to contracts awarded pursuant to competitive
 bidding.

 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 SECTION 105 - CONTROL OF WORK
 
 105.01--Authority of the Engineer. The Engineer has the authority to make decisions
 on all questions that may arise as to the quality and acceptability of materials, the work
 and the progress of the work; all questions that may arise as to the interpretation of the
 plans and specifications; and all questions as to the fulfillment of the Contract.
 The Engineer has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend the work wholly or in part
 and to withhold payments because of the Contractor's failure to correct conditions unsafe
 for workmen or the general public, for failure to carry out provisions of the Contract, or
 for failure to carry out orders. The Engineer may also suspend work for periods deemed
 necessary due to unsuitable weather conditions, for any conditions considered unsuitable
 for the prosecution of the work, or for any other condition or reason deemed by the
 Engineer to be in the public interest. The Department and the Commission shall not be
 held liable for any conditions that it is not made aware of, and there is no duty on the part
 of the Department to inspect for said unsafe and/or unsuitable conditions. The duty to
 ensure that the conditions are safe for workmen and the general public remains at all
 times with the Contractor, and shall not be altered by any course of conduct and/or action
 or inaction on the part of the Department.
 The Engineer may authorize, in writing, the continued prosecution of items past their
 specified seasonal limits when it is determined that the quality of the work will not be
 reduced and the public interest will be best served.
 The Engineer will have authority to enforce and make effective all decisions and orders
 relating to the Contract.
 All correspondence concerning a project, other than correspondence related to the
 execution of the Contract and sub-contracting, shall be sent to the Project Engineer. The
 Project Engineer will then forward any necessary correspondence to the appropriate
 Division. This includes general correspondence, submittals, shop drawings, requests for
 advancement of materials, etc. If electronic submittals are allowed, they may be
 submitted directly to the appropriate Division with copies to the Project Engineer.
 105.02--Plans and Working Drawings. After the Contract is executed by the Executive
 Director, the Contractor will receive, free of charge, two bound copies of the proposal
 and contract documents, one executed and one blank, two full scale copies of the plans
 and five half-scale copies. The Contractor shall have one copy of the proposal and
 contract documents and one half-scale copy of the plans available at all times during
 work activity on the project.
 Plans will generally show details of the work to be performed and a summary of the items
 appearing in the proposal.
 The plans will be supplemented by working drawings as necessary to adequately control
 the work. Working drawings shall be furnished by the Contractor as required for the
 completion of the work. Except where otherwise specified, working drawings shall be
 approved by the Engineer but such approval will not relieve the Contractor of any
 responsibility. Working drawings shall not be considered as plan changes and any
 conflicts on working drawings, whether approved or not, shall not supersede the
 requirements of the original plans and specifications.
 
 31
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 If required, the Contractor shall furnish the original tracings of working plans or drawings
 to the Engineer.
 The contract unit price shall include the cost of furnishing all working drawings.
 However, when design details of the plans are changed after the Contractor has submitted
 the required working drawings, the Engineer may order the Contractor to furnish revised
 or new working drawings as Extra Work.
 105.03--Conformity with Plans and Specifications. All work performed and all
 materials furnished shall be in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, crosssections, dimensions, material requirements and other construction requirements shown
 on the plans or required by the specifications. Where defined tolerances are specified
 in the contract, such tolerances shall fix the limits of reasonably close conformity.
 Plan dimensions and Contract specification values are target values to be strived for and
 from which tolerances are allowed. It is the intent of the specifications that the materials
 and workmanship shall be uniform in character and shall conform as realistically as
 possible to the prescribed target value or to the middle portion of the tolerance range.
 The purpose of the tolerance range is to accommodate occasional minor variations from
 the median zone that are unavoidable for practical reasons. When maximum and/or
 minimum values are specified, the production and processing of the material and the
 performance of the work shall be so controlled that the material and work will not be
 predominately of borderline quality or dimension. Predominantly borderline quality of
 materials or work on a continuing basis will be just cause for temporary suspension of
 work.
 In the event the Engineer finds that the materials or the finished product in which the
 materials are used are not within reasonably close conformity with the plans and
 specifications but that reasonably acceptable work has been produced, the Engineer will
 make a determination as to whether the work will be accepted and remain in place. The
 Engineer will then make an appropriate adjustment in the contract price for the work or
 materials as provided in the Contract. If no provision for adjustment in price is included
 in the Contract, the Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by Contract
 modification and also may provide for an adjustment in contract price. The
 documentation for adjustment in contract price will be based on engineering judgment if
 a standard criteria for the items involved has not been issued.
 When the materials, the finished product or the work are not in reasonably close
 conformity with the plans and specifications and have resulted in an inferior,
 unsatisfactory or unacceptable product, the work or materials shall be removed and
 replaced or otherwise corrected by the Contractor at no additional cost to the State in a
 manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 When work is of a temporary nature and its use is expected to be of short duration, the
 Engineer may allow minor deviations, not more than five percent (5%), from specified
 test values. Any such allowance will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for
 maintenance of the work.
 105.04--Coordination of Plans, Specifications, Interim Specifications, Special
 Provisions and Notice to Bidders. These specifications, interim specifications, plans,
 
 32
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 special provisions, notices to bidders and all other supplemental documents are essential
 parts of the Contract, and a requirement occurring in one Contract Document is as
 binding as though occurring in all. These contract documents are intended to be
 complementary and provide for a complete work. In case of discrepancy, calculated
 dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions. Parts of the Contract will prevail in the
 following order:
 (a)
 (b)
 (c)
 (d)
 (e)
 (f)
 
 Notices to Bidders
 Supplements to Special Provisions and Supplements to Interim Specifications
 Special Provisions
 Interim Specifications
 Plans
 Standard Specifications and Supplemental Specifications
 
 Any reference in the plans or contract documents to a particular Section or Subsection
 shall mean that Section or Subsection of the Standard Specifications, or that Section or
 Subsection as modified by the Contract.
 In case of a conflict between plan quantities, advertised quantities, and/or bid sheet
 quantities, the bid sheet quantities shall prevail.
 The Contractor shall not take advantage of any apparent error or omission in the plans or
 specifications. When the Contractor discovers an error or omission, the Engineer shall be
 immediately notified. The Engineer will then make corrections and interpretations
 deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the Contract.
 105.05--Cooperation by Contractor. The Contractor shall give the work the constant
 attention necessary to facilitate the progress thereof, and shall cooperate in every possible
 way with the Engineer, Inspectors and other Contractors on the given project as well as
 on any adjacent projects, as per Subsection 105.07.
 105.05.1--Project Superintendent. The Contractor shall have a competent and
 experienced full time resident superintendent who is capable of reading and
 understanding the plans and specifications for the particular work being performed. The
 superintendent shall be on the project site at any time work is being performed by the
 Prime Contractor or any Subcontractors. The superintendent shall advise the Project
 Engineer of an intended absence from the work and designate a person to be in charge of
 the work during such absence. The superintendent shall receive instructions from the
 Engineer or authorized representative. On projects that require 24/7 work, the Contractor
 will be required to list multiple superintendents to cover all time periods when work is
 being performed. Upon issuance of the Notice to Award, the Contractor or duly
 appointed agent authorized to bind the Contractor shall file with the Executive Director
 the name and address of the superintendent(s) who will supervise the work with copies to
 the Construction Engineer, Contract Administration Engineer, District Engineer and
 Project Engineer. The Executive Director shall be immediately notified in writing with
 copies to those stated when a change is made in the Contractor's superintendent or
 superintendent’s address. The superintendent shall have full authority to execute orders
 or directives of the Engineer without delay and to promptly supply materials, equipment,
 labor and incidentals as may be required. Such superintendence shall be furnished
 irrespective of the amount of work sublet.
 
 33
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 105.05.2--Certified Erosion Control Person (CECP). On projects that require an
 erosion control plan, the Contractor shall also designate a responsible person who will
 monitor and maintain the effectiveness of the erosion control plan, including NPDES
 permit requirements, and complete storm water reports as required by the Contract. Prior
 to or at the preconstruction conference, the Contractor shall designate in writing the
 CECP to the Project Engineer. The designated CECP shall be assigned to only one (1)
 project. When special conditions exist, such as two (2) adjoining projects or two (2)
 projects in close proximity, the Contractor may request in writing that the State
 Construction Engineer approve the use of one (1) CECP for both projects. The
 Contractor shall request in writing that the Engineer authorize a substitute CECP to act in
 the absence of the CECP. The designated CECP and substitute or replacement CECP
 must be certified by an organization approved by the Department. A copy of each
 CECP's certification must be included in the Contractor's Protection Plan as outlined in
 Subsection 107.22.1.
 105.05.2.1--Responsibilities and Duties of the Certified Erosion Control Person. In
 addition to the requirements set for in the NPDES Permit, the CECP shall also be
 responsible for the following:
 1. Attending preconstruction conference and each Erosion Control Inspection
 conducted by the Department.
 2. In accordance with the requirements of Subsection 107.22.1, ensuring all required
 documentation, such as, but not limited to, the SWPPP, ECP are:
  on the project site at all times,
  updated on a daily basis, and
  contain all revisions, additions, and modifications.
 3. In accordance with Subsection 107.22.1, ensuring the “19-acre” rule is being
 adhered to, if applicable.
 4. Ensuring the project has a rain gauge and maintain records of rainfall events on the
 Contractor’s Erosion Control Inspection reports.
 5. Ensuring the buffer zones around all stream-banks and wetland areas in which no
 construction activities are to take place are marked/flagged/roped off prior to any
 land disturbing activity.
 6. Ensuring perimeter erosion/sedimentation control devices (BMPs) are in place
 prior to any land disturbing activity.
 7. Reviewing and verifying the proper installation, maintenance, and effectiveness of
 the BMPs.
 8. Notifying the Project Engineer within 24 hours of learning that sediment has been
 deposited off Department ROW or into a wetland or waters of the U.S.
 9. Notifying the MDEQ within 24 hours of learning that sediment has been deposited
 into a wetland or waters of the U.S., copying the Project Engineer on the
 correspondence.
 10. Performing the Contractor’s Erosion Control Inspections of the project on the form
 provided by the Department for the purpose ensuring compliance with MDEQ’s
 Storm Water Construction General Permit. Contractor Inspections shall be
 performed:
  at least weekly, and
  within 24 hours or on the business day prior to any forecasted rain event
 of 60% or greater, and
 
 34
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 
 
 within 24 hours or on the next business day after a rainfall event of 0.5”
 or greater.
 The Contractor’s Erosion Control inspections shall commence with the installation
 of the BMPs and continue until the Final Maintenance Release or the partial
 maintenance release except for plant establishment has been issued. Within 24
 hours of completing each Contractor Erosion Control Inspection, the CECP shall
 provide the Project Engineer with a copy of the report documenting the findings of
 each Contractor Erosion Control Inspection. The CECP will discuss the findings
 with the Contractor’s Superintendent, if the CECP and the superintendent aren’t
 the same person, and the Project Engineer or his representative. Failure to submit
 the completed and signed inspection forms may result in the withholding of the
 monthly estimate.
 105.05.2.2--Deficient Performance of the Certified Erosion Control Person. In the
 event that the Contractor’s CECP is not meeting the requirements set forth above, the
 Project Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing, describing the CECP’s deficient
 performance. If the deficient performance should continue, the Department may take any
 or all actions listed below:
 1. stop all non-erosion control work,
 2. require the Contractor to designate a new CECP with the responsibilities and
 authority listed in Subsection 105.05.2.1,
 3. revise the SWPPP and ECP with the newly designated CECP’s certification
 information, and
 In the event that a CECP is removed from serving as a CECP on a project, this person
 shall not be accepted as a Contractor’s CECP on MDOT projects for at least one year
 from the time of removal.
 105.06--Cooperation with Utilities. The Department will notify all utility companies,
 all pipe line owners and other known affected parties and endeavor to have plans and
 agreements for all necessary adjustments within or adjacent to the limits of construction
 before bids are received. Such utility plans and agreements will be made available for
 inspection by the Contractor in the Jackson Office. The Department will also endeavor to
 have all necessary adjustments made as soon as practicable.
 All utility appurtenances are to be relocated or adjusted by others unless provided
 otherwise in the Contract.
 All known utilities within the project are shown on the plans. It is understood and agreed
 that the Contractor’s bid has considered all of the utility appurtenances in their present or
 relocated positions and that no additional compensation will be allowed for delays,
 inconvenience, or damage sustained by the Contractor due to interference from the said
 utility appurtenances or the operation of moving them. The Engineer's determination that
 removing, relocating, or adjusting of utility appurtenances or failure of others to do so is
 causing a delay in major phases of construction that normally should be in progress will
 be considered a delay by the State in the determination of extension of contract time, but
 any such delay shall not be the basis for any liability or monetary damage against the
 Commission, the Department and/or any of its officers or employees. In the event the
 utility owners fail to comply with their responsibility in relocating or adjusting their
 facilities, the Engineer may require the Contractor to make adjustments as Extra Work.
 
 35
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 105.07--Cooperation Between Contractors. The Department reserves the right to
 award contracts for work on or near work covered by other contracts. Each Contractor
 will be expected to cooperate with the other Contractor(s) and the Department in every
 reasonable manner.
 The Department will make a determination as to the practicality of prosecuting an
 existing contract before an additional award is made for work in the same area. Insofar
 as is practicable, the Department will give notice of the intent to award subsequent
 contracts in the same area. Failure to do so, however, shall not prejudice the rights of the
 Commission to award additional contracts and shall not constitute grounds for claims
 against the State, the Commission, the Department or any of its officers or employees.
 When separate contracts are let for work, any part or all of which is within the same
 limits, each Contractor’s work shall be conducted so as to cause the least interference
 with work being performed by the other Contractor(s).
 When contracts are awarded to separate Contractors for concurrent construction within a
 common area, the Contractors, in conference with the Engineer, shall establish a written
 joint schedule of operations. Such schedule will set out approximate dates and sequences
 for work to be performed with due regard to needs and contract time limitations of each
 contract. The Engineer may allow modification of the schedule when mutual benefit to
 the Contractors and the Department will result. Any modification of the joint schedule
 shall be in writing, mutually agreeable, and signed by the Contractors.
 Failure of either Contractor to abide by the terms of the joint schedule or modified
 schedule will be justification for termination of the Contract under the provision of
 Subsection 108.08.
 Each Contractor’s work shall be arranged such that the placement and disposal of the
 materials and equipment being used shall not interfere with the operations of the other
 Contractor. Each Contractor shall join their work with that of others in an acceptable
 manner and perform it in the sequence of the established schedule.
 Each Contractor involved shall assume all liability, financial and otherwise, in connection
 with the Contract and shall protect and save harmless the Commission, the Department or
 any of its officers or employees from any and all damages or claims of any kind that may
 arise, including but not limited to, inconvenience, delay or loss experienced because of
 the presence and operations of the other Contractor(s) working within the same contract
 limits.
 When the plans and/or proposal indicate that there is a railroad crossing the project at
 grade, the Department may construct or have constructed by others an at-grade railroad
 crossing. This work may also include adjustment or installation of allied traffic safety
 features. If the railroad work is to be performed under separate contract let by the
 Department, all the provisions of this subsection are applicable. When the work is to be
 performed by the railroad or its Contractor, all the provisions of this subsection are
 applicable except a schedule of operations will not be required.
 105.08--Construction Stakes, Lines and Grades. Except when the Contract contains a
 pay item for "Roadway Construction Stakes," the Engineer will set construction stakes
 
 36
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 establishing lines, slopes, and profile grades in road work and only centerline and bench
 marks for bridge work. Box bridges shall not be considered as a bridge. The Engineer
 also will furnish the Contractor with all necessary information relating to lines, slopes,
 and grades. These stakes and bench marks shall constitute the field control by which the
 Contractor shall establish and maintain all necessary controls and perform the work.
 The Department will assume responsibility for the accuracy of the stakes and bench
 marks at the time they are set by the Engineer or the Engineer’s representative. Any
 corrective work caused by inaccurate field controls established by the Department will be
 considered as Extra Work and paid for under appropriate provisions of the Contract.
 The Contractor shall be held responsible for the preservation of all stakes and bench
 marks, and when carelessly or willfully destroyed or disturbed, the cost of replacing them
 will be charged against the Contractor.
 When the Contract contains a pay item for construction stakes, Section 699 shall apply.
 105.09--Authority and Duties of the Resident or Project Engineer. As the direct
 representative of the Chief Engineer, the assigned Resident or Project Engineer has
 immediate charge of the engineering details of the Contract. The Resident or Project
 Engineer is responsible for the administration of the Contract, and the authority is
 delegated commensurate with these responsibilities.
 105.10--Duties of the Inspector. Inspectors employed by the Department will be
 authorized to inspect all work and materials. The inspection may extend to all parts of
 the work and to the preparation, fabrication or manufacture of the materials. The
 Inspector will not be authorized to alter or waive the provisions of the Contract, to issue
 instructions contrary to the plans and specifications or to act as foreman for the
 Contractor.
 105.11--Inspection of Work. All materials and each part or detail of the work are
 subject to inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer shall be allowed access to all of the
 work and shall be furnished with such information and assistance by the Contractor as
 necessary to make a complete and detailed inspection.
 Prior to acceptance of the work, the Contractor shall remove or uncover such portions of
 the work as directed by the Engineer. After examination, the Contractor shall restore said
 portions of the work. If the work exposed or examined was acceptable, the uncovering or
 removing and the restoring of the work will be paid as Extra Work. If the work so
 exposed or examined was unacceptable, the uncovering or removing and the restoring of
 the work will be at no additional cost to the State or the Commission.
 Work performed or materials used by the Contractor without supervision or inspection by
 an authorized Department representative may be ordered removed and replaced. In the
 event it is determined by the Executive Director that non-supervision or non-inspection
 by the Department was due to the failure of the Engineer to have a representative present
 after having been given reasonable notice in writing that the work was to be performed,
 the work may be examined, removed or replaced as ordered and will be paid as Extra
 Work if the work so exposed or examined was acceptable. Otherwise, such unauthorized
 work shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the State or the Commission.
 
 37
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 Although the Engineer and/or his authorized representative may inspect the work and has
 the right to stop any and all work not conforming to the contract documents and these
 specifications, the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the work is completed according
 to the contract documents and these specifications rests with the Contractor. Any
 inspections conducted by or on behalf of the Department do not relieve the Contractor
 from this obligation, nor does the fact that inspections are conducted or ordered by the
 Department create a course of conduct that can in any way be construed as a waiver of
 the Contractor’s duties and responsibilities.
 When any unit of government, political subdivision, railroad corporation, or other public
 service is to pay a portion of the cost of the work its respective representative shall have
 the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no way make said agency or
 corporation a party to this Contract and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either
 party of the Contract.
 105.12--Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work. Unless otherwise
 determined acceptable under the provisions of Subsection 105.03, all work that does not
 conform to the requirements of the Contract will be considered as unacceptable work.
 Unacceptable work, whether the result of poor workmanship, defective materials, damage
 through carelessness or any other cause, found prior to final acceptance of the work shall
 be removed and replaced in an acceptable manner, without any additional cost to the
 Commission.
 Work done contrary to the instructions of the Engineer, or beyond the lines shown on the
 plans or extra work without authority will not be paid for under the provisions of the
 Contract.
 All work shall be warrantied for a period of one (1) year following final acceptance. Any
 defective or nonconforming work, or latent defects, shall be corrected by the Contractor,
 at no cost to the Department.
 105.13--Load and Speed Restrictions. The Contractor shall determine and comply with
 all legal load restrictions in the hauling of materials on public roads beyond the limits of
 the project. The Department shall have no obligation to determine or inform the
 Contractor of any legal load limitations of any municipality, county or the State of
 Mississippi. A special permit will not relieve the Contractor of liability for damages that
 may result from the moving of material or equipment.
 All trucks hauling materials to and from this project shall comply with the legal weight
 limits as established by law. The Department will not compensate the Contractor for any
 portion of a load delivered to the project in excess of the legal limit for that truck.
 Vehicles relying on harvest permits are limited to hauling only those materials set forth in
 Section 27-19-81(4) of the Mississippi Code, as amended.
 Within the project limits, the operation of equipment of such weight or so loaded as to
 cause damage to the roadway, structures or other work is forbidden. The Contractor shall
 regulate loads such that damage will not occur to structures or any completed subgrade or
 pavement structure, but in no case shall loads exceed the legal weight limit. Loads will
 not be permitted on a concrete pavement, base or structure before the expiration of the
 
 38
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 curing period. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages caused by hauling
 equipment.
 The Contractor shall provide approved platform scales or a sufficient number of approved
 portable scales together with essentials for calibrating and all labor, tools, and equipment
 necessary to weigh as many loaded vehicles as will assure the Engineer of the
 Contractor's compliance with weight restrictions.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the safe speed of vehicles assigned to the project.
 Speeds less than those provided by law may be ordered in writing by the Engineer when
 in the opinion of the Engineer such action is essential to public safety or to the quality of
 work.
 105.14--Maintenance During Construction. The Contractor will be responsible for the
 maintenance of existing roadways within the limits of this project starting on the date of
 the Notice to Proceed. Anytime work is performed in a travel lane, the Contractor shall
 install portable lane closure signs meeting the requirement of the Department Standard
 Drawing or the Latest Edition of the MUTCD.
 The Contractor shall maintain the work until released from maintenance. This
 maintenance shall require continuous and effective work prosecuted day by day with
 adequate equipment, forces and material to the end that the roadway structures and all
 other features of the work are kept in satisfactory condition at all times. Traffic shall be
 continuously, safely and conveniently maintained as required under the Contract.
 In the case of a Contract for the placing of a previously constructed course or subgrade,
 the Contractor shall maintain the previous course or subgrade during all construction
 operations.
 All cost for maintenance of the work shall be included in the contract unit prices bid on
 the various pay items, and the Contractor will not be paid any additional amount for such
 work except as otherwise provided in the Contract.
 The Contractor must abide by the Department highway right-of-way control of access
 and any additional construction access points as designed and allowed within the plans or
 Contract for access within the project limits. The Contractor shall be responsible for
 obtaining permission from local officials for construction traffic to travel along and
 access the project limits from local roads. MDOT will not be held liable for any damage
 to local roads. Local roads that sustain damage due to construction traffic are expected to
 be restored to conditions equal to or better than the pre-award conditions at the
 Contractor’s expense.
 The Contractor shall cooperate with the Department to allow MDOT personnel or MDOT
 representatives, FHWA, and other governmental agencies to access the construction site
 to perform inspections at any time deemed appropriate.
 105.15--Failure to Maintain Roadway or Structures. If the Contractor, at any time,
 fails to comply with the provisions of Subsection 105.14, the Engineer will immediately
 notify the Contractor of such non-compliance. When the deficiency creates a traffic
 hazard, the Contractor shall immediately use all available means to correct or otherwise
 remove the hazard. The Contractor's failure to remedy unsatisfactory maintenance within
 
 39
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 24 hours after receipt of such notice will be just cause for the Engineer to maintain the
 project with such forces as the Engineer deems necessary. Any and all cost to the
 Department will be deducted from monies due or to become due the Contractor.
 105.16--Blank.
 105.17--Claims for Adjustments and Disputes. No claim shall be considered unless
 the Contractor has complied with all the requirements of Subsection 104.02.4. If the
 Engineer has denied the request for a change to the work per Subsection 104.02.4, the
 Contractor may commence with the filing of a claim as outlined in this Subsection.
 A. Notice of Intent to File a Claim. Within 30 calendar days of receiving the
 Engineer’s decision as outlined in Subsection 104.02.4, the Contractor shall provide the
 Engineer with a written notice of intent to file a claim on the Notice of Intent Form
 (CSD-145) available from the Project Engineer or on the MDOT Construction Division
 webpage.
 After filing the written notice of intent, the Contractor shall maintain adequate records
 related to the claim, including records of the labor, equipment and materials, and, if
 applicable, monthly schedule updates showing critical path delays to the completion date.
 The Contractor must update and disclose this information to the Department. The
 Department, any consultant retained by the Department, and/or FHWA may conduct any
 inspections necessary and/or audit claim records at any time, including the Contractor’s
 books and records. Unless the Engineer suspends in writing the affected work, the
 Contractor shall continue to perform the disputed work.
 If the notice of intent is not submitted within the 30 calendar days as specified above, or
 if the Engineer is not given sufficient opportunity for keeping strict account of the
 Contractor’s actual costs, then the Contractor waives the right to file a claim for
 additional compensation or time. Such notice by the Contractor and the Engineer’s
 accounting of the cost shall not in any way prove or substantiate the validity of the claim.
 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as establishing a claim contrary to the terms
 of Subsection 104.02.
 B. Submission of a Claim. Within 60 calendar days after submitting the notice of intent
 to file a claim or within 60 calendar days of completing the disputed work, whichever is
 later, the Contractor shall submit a complete claim package. If the claim package is not
 submitted within the 60 calendar days as specified above, then the Contractor waives the
 right to file a claim for additional compensation or time. The claim package shall include
 all documents supporting the claim and provide sufficient detail to enable the Department
 to ascertain the basis and amount of the claim. At a minimum, the following information
 shall be submitted with each claim:
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 4.
 
 A completed Notice of Claim Form (CSD-155), which form may be obtained
 from the Project Engineer or on the MDOT Construction Division webpage.
 A detailed factual statement of the claim for additional compensation, time or
 both, providing all necessary dates, locations, and items of work affected by the
 claim.
 The date on which the facts were discovered that gave rise to the claim.
 The specific provisions of the Contract that support the claim and a statement of
 the reasons why such provisions support the claim.
 
 40
 
 Section 105
 5.
 6.
 
 Section 105
 
 If an extension of contract time is sought, a schedule analysis as required by the
 Engineer.
 If additional compensation is sought, the amount and specifics of the
 compensation.
 
 C. Department Decision. Once the Contractor properly files a claim, provides all
 necessary documentation, and, if requested, allows for reasonable and timely access to
 the Contractor’s books and records, the Department will review the claim and render a
 written decision to the Contractor to either affirm or deny the claim, in whole or in part.
 The Department’s decision will be provided within 90 calendar days after receipt of all
 requested information, including any audit of the Contractor’s books and records, or at
 such time agreed upon by the parties.
 Once a claim is filed and the Department commences review of the claim, the submission
 and consideration of additional information or data, other than for clarification and
 support of previously submitted documentation, will not be permitted. The Department’s
 written decision to the Contractor will describe the information considered by the
 Department in reaching a decision and the basis for that decision.
 If the Department decides to affirm the claim, an adjustment will be made as applicable.
 If the Department denies the claim, the Contractor may either accept the Department
 decision as final or may file a claim with the State Highway Arbitration Board or a file a
 lawsuit, whichever may be appropriate based on the monetary demand made by the
 Contractor. Strict compliance with the claims process described in this Subsection
 105.17 is a condition precedent to the filing of any arbitration claim or lawsuit and failure
 to follow any of the requirements herein will be grounds for dismissal of the arbitration
 or lawsuit.
 D. Auditing of Claims. All claims filed against the Department may be subject to audit
 by the Department’s internal Audit Division, any consultant retained by the Department
 to review the Contractor’s claim, and/or FHWA at any time following the filing of such
 claim. The audit may begin upon a 5-day notice to the Contractor, subcontractor or
 supplier, or at such time agreed to by the parties. The Contractor, subcontractor and/or
 supplier shall cooperate with the auditor and/or consultant. Failure of the Contractor,
 subcontractor and/or supplier to maintain and retain sufficient records to allow the
 Department’s auditor and/or consultant to verify the claim shall constitute a waiver of
 that portion of the claim that cannot be verified and shall bar recovery thereof. The
 Contractor, subcontractor and/or supplier shall provide the auditor and/or consultant with
 a minimum of the following documents:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 9.
 10.
 
 Daily time sheets and foreman’s daily reports.
 Union agreements, if any.
 Insurance, welfare and benefits records.
 Payroll register.
 Earnings records.
 Material invoices, purchase orders and all material and supply acquisition
 contracts.
 Equipment records (list of company equipment, rates, etc.).
 Vendor rental agreements and Subcontractor invoices.
 Canceled checks (payroll and vendors).
 Job cost report.

 Section 105
 
 Job payroll ledger.
 General ledger, general journal (if used) and all subsidiary ledgers and
 journals together with all supporting documentation pertinent to entries made
 in these ledgers and journals.
 Cash disbursements journal.
 Any other documentation that the auditor and/or consultant deems necessary
 to the review of the claim.
 
 105.18--Automatically Controlled Equipment. Unless otherwise prohibited in other
 sections of the specifications or other contract documents, automatically controlled
 equipment that malfunctions may be operated manually or by other approved methods for
 a period of time approved by the Engineer so as to prevent loss or damage to the work
 already produced, manufactured, or processed at the time of the breakdown or
 malfunction. The resulting work must meet the requirements of the Contract.
 105.19--Safety Apparel. All workers within the right-of-way shall wear high-visibility
 safety apparel in accordance with the requirements of Section 6D.03 of the MUTCD.
 Workers are defined as people on foot whose duties place them within the right-of way of
 highways, such as highway construction and maintenance forces, survey crews, utility
 crews, responders to incidents within the highway right-of-way, and law enforcement
 personnel when directing traffic, investigating crashes, and handling lane closures,
 obstructed roadways, and disasters within the right-of-way.
 105.20--Acceptance.
 105.20.1--Partial Acceptance of a Unit. When the Contractor has completed a unit of
 the work such as an interchange, a structure, a portion of the road or pavement or one
 project of a multi-project Contract, the Contractor may request the Engineer to make a
 final inspection of that unit. The Executive Director may also order a final inspection of
 the unit, at the Executive Director’s discretion. If the Engineer finds upon inspection that
 the unit has been completed in compliance with the Contract and it is a complete facility
 that can be made available to the public or made available for the prosecution of work
 under another contract, the Executive Director may conditionally accept the unit and
 conditionally relieve the Contractor of certain contractual responsibilities as defined in
 the release.
 In the event items of work covered by such release are found to be defective or deficient
 as evidenced by unsatisfactory test reports of materials incorporated in the work or other
 engineering determination, the release shall be null and void upon written notification to
 the Contractor. The Contractor shall make all corrections, restorations, constructions or
 reconstructions deemed necessary and shall resume all contractual responsibilities until
 all corrective measures have been made in accordance with the terms of the Contract.
 Partial acceptance does not constitute final acceptance of the work, or any part thereof,
 nor in any way void or alter any of the terms of the Contract.
 Relief from "certain contractual responsibilities" as indicated herein may, or may not,
 include:
 (a) Further maintenance of the defined limits of the partially accepted work.
 (b) Further public liability for the defined limits of the partially accepted work.
 
 42
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 (c) Further liability for liquidated damages as applicable to the value of the partially
 accepted work when the quantities for the partially accepted work are separate
 quantities listed on the Summary of Quantities sheet of the plans, and the
 separate quantities and the total amounts thereof are listed on the Engineer's
 Estimate. Otherwise, no reduction in liquidated damages will be made because
 of such partial acceptance.
 Unless specifically provided in the Contract, the liability for liquidated damages
 shall not be reduced to less than that applicable under the Contract for an
 amount of such work equal to at least fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of
 work under the Contract.
 105.20.2--Partial Maintenance Release of a Project. Upon written notice from the
 Contractor of presumptive completion of all the work and upon due notice from the
 Resident or Project Engineer, the Engineer will make an inspection.
 If the inspection discloses any work as being unsatisfactory or incomplete, the Engineer
 will discuss in detail with the Contractor all discrepancies in the work. Upon correction
 of the work, another inspection will be made that shall constitute the final inspection,
 provided the work has been satisfactorily completed.
 However, if during the final inspection the Engineer determines that all work has been
 satisfactorily completed except for growth and coverage of plant establishment on all or
 part of the work, the Engineer may recommend partial release of all work except items
 related to growth and coverage. Upon such recommendation, the Contractor will be
 given a partial release of maintenance and shall be released from further contractual
 liabilities for the completed work other than warranty work or latent defects. The
 Contractor will retain responsibility for plant establishment and all maintenance and
 repairs appurtenant thereto until satisfactory growth and coverage is achieved. This
 responsibility may also include the continuation of the required storm water inspection
 and reporting.
 105.20.3--Final Maintenance Release of a Project. Upon written notice from the
 Contractor of presumptive completion of all the work and upon due notice from the
 Resident or Project Engineer, the Engineer will make an inspection. If all work provided
 by the Contract has been completed to the Engineer’s satisfaction, the inspection will
 constitute the final inspection, and the Engineer will conditionally release the Contractor
 of maintenance.
 As provided in the Contract, in the event items of work are found to be deficient or
 defective as evidenced by unsatisfactory test reports of material incorporated into the
 work, the Contractor shall assume full responsibility for corrective measures, and shall
 reassume maintenance and public liability until such corrective measures are completed
 to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 105.20.4.--Final Acceptance of a Project. Upon evidence that the Contractor has
 fulfilled all obligations under the Contract, the Executive Director will make final
 acceptance and notify the Contractor in writing. Final acceptance of the project will not
 be given until all obligations imposed under the Contract, including but not limited to the
 final reporting of payrolls, final reporting of DBE payments, acceptable certifications and
 test reports of materials used, etc., have been fulfilled. However, the Contractor remains
 
 43
 
 Section 105
 
 Section 105
 
 responsible for all warranty work and any latent defects found within one year of final
 acceptance.
 
 SECTION 106 - CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 106.01--Source of Supply and Quality Requirements.
 106.01.1--General. The materials used in the work shall meet all quality requirements of
 the Contract. At the option of the Engineer, materials may be approved at the source of
 supply provided the Contractor notifies the Engineer of the proposed source of material
 well in advance of the time of proposed delivery. If previously approved materials do not
 produce uniform and satisfactory products, the Contractor shall furnish materials from
 other sources.
 106.01.2--Warranties, Guaranties, Instruction Sheets and Parts Lists.
 For
 manufactured articles, units, components or materials incorporated in any mechanical or
 electrical facility required under the Contract, the manufacturer's warranties, guaranties,
 instruction sheets and parts lists shall be delivered before final acceptance of the work.
 106.02--Local Materials Sources.
 106.02.1--Designated Sources. Possible sources of local material may be designated on
 the plans or described in the special provisions. The quality of material in such deposits
 will be acceptable in general, but the Contractor shall determine for himself the
 equipment and work required to produce uniform, acceptable material. It shall be
 understood that it is not feasible to ascertain from samples the specific limits of
 acceptable material from the entire deposit and variations shall be considered as usual
 and are to be expected. The Engineer may order procurement of material from any
 portion of the deposit and may reject other portions of the deposit as unacceptable.
 Unless designated sources are identified in the Contract as State Furnished or State
 Optioned, acquisition and rights of ingress and egress shall be the responsibility of the
 Contractor.
 106.02.2--Contractor Furnished Sources. The Contractor shall provide sources of
 materials meeting the requirements of the Contract and shall bear all costs involved,
 including the cost to the Department for sampling and testing for source approval.
 The Department's costs will be based on the standard sampling and testing charges
 published in Department SOP, and the charges will be deducted from monies due the
 Contractor.
 The Department will assume the cost of acceptance sampling and testing during
 production and use of the materials.
 All pits and quarry sites are subject to approval from the Mississippi Department of
 Environmental Quality, Office of Geology, as set forth in Subsection 107.23.
 106.02.3--All Sources. All pit operations including hauling shall comply with the
 applicable provisions of Subsection 107.22. Unless otherwise permitted, all pits shall be
 
 44
 
 Section 106
 
 Section 106
 
 drained upon completion.
 106.03--Samples, Tests, and Cited Specifications. All materials used in the work shall
 conform to the general requirements of Section 700 and the specific requirements for
 each item of work. Cited specifications of AASHTO, ASTM or Federal Specifications
 for materials or test methods shall be understood to mean approved pre-published or
 published "Standards" of ASTM, AASHTO, Federal Specifications; Interim

 Section 107
 
 therefore, shall be contingent upon provisions being made and carried out for the
 prevention or minimization of siltation, pollution from soil erosion, and air pollution.
 Accordingly, it is the intent of the Contract that erosion be prevented by the
 establishment of all necessary temporary and permanent erosion control features as the
 work progresses from beginning to completion. The primary objective shall be to
 establish and maintain all permanent erosion control features as soon as possible. Until
 such time, each operation shall include the effective use of temporary measures as
 necessary to maintain ground surface conditions so as to prevent or minimize siltation or
 pollution.
 107.22.1--Contractor's Erosion Control Plan (ECP).
 At the preconstruction
 conference or prior to starting any work on the project, the Contractor shall submit to the
 Project Engineer for concurrence a comprehensive erosion and siltation control plan
 (ECP). The ECP shall utilize temporary measures and permanent erosion control features
 to provide acceptable controls during all stages of construction. If an early Notice to
 Proceed is desired, the Contractor’s ECP should be submitted to the Engineer as soon as
 possible after award since an approved erosion control plan is required for an early
 Notice to Proceed.
 The time between the Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed/Beginning of Contract
 Time in the proposal, has been allowed for the submittal and concurrence of the
 Contractor’s ECP, MDOT’s review of the plan, and any revisions that may be necessary.
 The original contract time shall not be adjusted unless delays are caused solely by the
 Department for the submission, review, and concurrence of the Contractor’s ECP.
 As a minimum, the ECP shall include the following:
 1.
 
 2.
 
 3.
 
 ECP sheets or the plan profile sheets, 11” x 17” or larger, of all areas within the
 rights-of-way from the Beginning of the Project (BOP) to the End of the Project
 (EOP) showing the location of all temporary erosion control devices. Erosion
 control devices should be identified by exact type, temporary or permanent,
 configuration, and placement of each item to prevent erosion and siltation. A
 narrative of the Contractor’s temporary erosion control plan shall be submitted in a
 format similar to the form below, but must include the heading and sub-heading
 information. The narrative should include, at a minimum, the following:
  A detailed description, including locations (station numbers) of the
 Contractor’s proposed sequence of operations including, but not limited to,
 clearing and grubbing, excavation, drainage, and structures.
  A detailed description, including locations, and best management practices
 (BMP) that will be used to prevent siltation and erosion from occurring during
 the Contractor’s proposed sequence of operations.
 A copy of the certification for the Contractor’s Certified Erosion Control Person
 whose primary duty shall be monitoring and maintaining the effectiveness of the
 ECP, BMPs, and compliance with the NPDES permit requirements.
 A plan for the disposal of waste materials on the project right-of-way that includes
 but should not be limited to the following:
  containment and disposal of materials resulting from the cleaning (washing
 out) of concrete trucks that are delivering concrete to the project site.
  containment and disposal of fuel / petroleum materials at staging areas on the
 project.
 
 63
 
 Section 107
 
 Section 107
 
 The ECP must be maintained on the project site at all times, updated as work progresses
 to show changes due to revisions in the sequences of construction operations,
 replacement of inadequate BMPs, and the maintenance of BMPs. Work shall not start
 until an ECP has been concurred with by the Department. The Engineer has the authority
 to suspend all work and/or withhold payments for failure of the Contractor to carry out
 provisions of MDEQ’s Storm Water Construction General Permit, the ECP, updates to
 the ECP, and /or proper maintenance of the BMPs.
 As soon as the ECP has been approved, a copy of the SWPPP (Narrative, ECP with
 updates) shall be available at the project at all times. The Contractor shall provide and
 install a weatherproof enclosure, such as a mailbox, at the project at a readily accessible
 location to the Engineer or others who may want to review the ECP. The cost of
 installing and maintaining this enclosure shall be included in the prices bid for the various
 erosion control pay items and no direct payment will be made for this work.

 SITE INFORMATION
 This project consists of grading and installing drainage structures necessary to construct
 approximately 6 miles of parallel lanes on SR 31 between the Hinds County Line and the
 Rankin County Line.
 SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROLS
 VEGETATIVE CONTROLS: Clearing and grubbing areas will be minimized to
 comply with the buffer zones (minimum of 15 feet along the ROW lines and 5 feet along
 creeks) as per the contract documents.
 A combination of temporary and permanent
 grassing will be used to protect slopes as construction progresses. Should a disturbed
 area be left undisturbed for 14 days or more, temporary BMPs (seeding & mulching,
 silt fences, basins, ditch checks, slope drains, etc.) or permanent erosion control measures
 (seeding & mulching, riprap, paved ditch, flumes, etc.) will be placed within 7 calendar
 days.
 STRUCTURAL CONTROLS: Gravel construction entrance/exit will be installed near
 Stations 145+50, 159+50, 164+50 & 172+50. Riprap ditch checks will be constructed at
 Stations 144+50, 151+75, 162+00 & 166+25. The Concrete washout area will be at
 Stations 140+25, 152+00 & 168+50.
 HOUSEKEEPING PRACTICES: Structural BPM’s will be cleaned out when
 sediment reaches 1/3 to 1/2 of the height of the BMP. Maintenance and repair of
 equipment will be performed off-site, material wash out will occur either off-site or
 within designated wash out areas.
 POST-CONSTRUCTION CONTROL MEASURES: As construction is completed,
 permanent vegetative growth will be established on disturbed soils to improve soil
 stability and provide a buffer zone for loose material. Paved ditches and flumes will be
 placed as specified in the ECP to reduce erosion in concentrated flow areas and rip rap
 will be placed as specified to dissipate flow energy and reduce flow velocity.
 IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
 Perimeter controls will be installed first. Clearing and grubbing will be performed in 19acre sections beginning at the BOP and temporary grassing will be installed as needed.
 Temporary erosion control BMP’s will be installed at the drainage structures prior/during
 construction of the drainage structures. Grading activities will commence at the BOP
 and proceed towards the EOP, fill slopes will be permanently grassed in stages for fill
 heights that exceed 5 feet. Base materials will be installed on completed grading sections
 with the paving to follow.
 MAINTENANCE PLAN
 All erosion and sediment control practices will be checked for stability and operation
 following every rainfall but in no case less than once every week. Any needed repairs
 will be made immediately to maintain all practices as designed. Sediment basins will be
 cleaned out when the level of sediment reaches 2.0 feet below the top of the riser.
 Sediment will be removed from behind BMP’s when it becomes about 1/3 to 1/2 height
 of BMP.

 107.22.2--Clearing and Grubbing, Haul Roads, Waste Areas, Plant Sites or Other
 Areas Occupied by the Contractor. Clearing and grubbing on erodible areas,
 construction and maintenance of haul roads, plant sites or other areas occupied by the
 Contractor in connection with the work shall include adequate protection for preventing
 excessive erodible material from entering water or waterways on land not occupied by
 the Contractor and preventing dust created by hauling equipment.
 Temporary measures shall be employed as necessary by the Contractor from the
 beginning of the work. These measures may consist of the expeditious use of brush,
 vegetation or other residue from clearing and grubbing, temporary or permanent terraces,
 berms, dikes, dams, sediment basins or other effective means of containing sediment. All
 temporary or permanent erosion control features shall be maintained in an effective
 manner so long as essential to the abatement of siltation.
 After temporary features are no longer useful or needed, such features shall be removed
 and the area restored or prepared for subsequent work. All temporary protection shall be
 the responsibility of the Contractor, and measurement for direct payment will not be
 made unless otherwise provided in the Contract.
 Unless otherwise determined by the Engineer from a study of overall job conditions, the
 exposed surface area of erodible material at any one time on this project shall not exceed
 19 acres without prior approval by the Engineer.
 In addition to the applicable requirements of the MDEQ, Office of Pollution Control, the
 burning of waste vegetation resulting from site or right-of-way clearing shall meet the
 following requirements:
 (a) Starter and auxiliary fuels must not cause excessive visible emissions. Rubber
 tires, etc. are prohibited.
 (b) The burning must be permitted by local ordinance.
 (c) The burning must be conducted at least 500 yards from an occupied dwelling,
 but may be reduced to 50 yards if forced draft air is provided for combustion.
 (d) The burning must be conducted at least 500 yards from commercial airport
 property, private airfields or marked aircraft approach corridors except when a
 lesser distance is authorized by the airport authority.
 (e) The burning must not produce a traffic hazard.
 (f) Burning will not be allowed during a High Fire Danger Alert issued by the
 Mississippi Forestry Commission or an Emergency Air Pollution Episode Alert
 issued by MDEQ , Office of Pollution Control.
 In response to the MDEQ concern of the air quality (ground-level ozone) in DeSoto,
 Hancock, Harrison, Hinds, Madison, Rankin, and Jackson Counties, the Department has
 agreed to place certain restrictions on open burning of land-clearing debris.
 The Contractor is advised that no open burning of land-clearing debris will be permitted
 to begin during ozone action days as designated by MDEQ. An ozone action day is
 defined as a 24-hour period when the ozone concentration reaches an unacceptable predetermined level. Usually, an ozone action day has a duration of one (1) day. It is
 estimated that 3 to 15 ozone action days could occur from April through October.
 
 66
 
 Section 107
 
 Section 107
 
 During open burning operations, the Project Engineer should check the 1, 2, and 3-day
 ozone forecasts made available each day by MDEQ on its web site, www.deq.state.ms.us,
 and should e-mail or FAX the forecasts to the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide
 the Project Engineer sufficient time to monitor the ozone forecasts prior to commencing
 any open burning operation. The Contractor cannot begin open burning until the forecast
 for the next three (3) days are non-ozone action days. However, when the Contractor is
 permitted to begin open burning, that day’s burning shall continue regardless of the ozone
 forecasts when checked on the following day. For example, if the Project Engineer
 checks the forecast on Monday morning and finds that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
 are non-ozone action days, the Contractor may begin open burning. If the Project
 Engineer checks the forecasts on Tuesday and finds that Wednesday has been designated
 as an ozone action day, the open burning that was started on Monday may continue, but
 the Contractor cannot begin any new burning until the next 3-day forecasts indicate nonozone action days.
 Restrictions on open burning as set forth above will not be a basis for additional time or
 compensation.
 107.22.3--Pit Operations. The Contractor shall schedule, arrange and conduct pit
 operations in such a manner that prevents siltation or pollution of ditches, streams, lakes,
 reservoirs and adjacent property with sediment, fuels, oils or other objectionable
 materials.
 107.22.4--Structures, Grading, and Other Construction. The Contractor shall perform
 all work required under the Contract in such a manner and with such protective features
 that controls and contain siltation within the limits of the work. Performance in the
 designated or directed sequence and the providing of all erosion protection for which pay
 items are not included in the Contract shall be considered as included in prices bid for
 other items of work.
 The Contractor shall prevent or minimize undesirable siltation in connection with
 excavation, construction and backfill of structures. Such temporary measures as
 indicated herein for clearing and grubbing or other measures such as covering of
 excavated materials, lining channels, constructing bulkheads or other effective measures
 shall be employed.
 The Engineer should limit the areas of excavation, borrow, and embankment operations
 commensurate with the Contractor's capability and progress in keeping the finish grading,
 seeding, mulching, and other such permanent erosion control measures current. If
 seasonal limitations make such coordination unrealistic, temporary erosion control
 measures may be used to the extent feasible and justified. The exposed surface area of
 erodible material at any one time for each grading operation should not exceed 19 acres
 without prior approval by the Engineer.
 The Engineer may increase or decrease the areas of erodible material to be exposed at
 any one time by clearing and grubbing, excavation, borrow and fill operations as
 determined by analysis of project conditions.
 It is the intent of these specifications that the work shall proceed in a manner and
 sequence to ensure the earliest possible establishment of permanent erosion control items.

 Section 107
 
 107.22.5--Special Temporary Erosion Control. The plans may designate special
 temporary erosion control work such as fast growing grasses or other designated
 temporary features for problem areas during grading, paving or other construction work.
 Unless otherwise provided, quantities for such temporary features shown on the plans
 will be included in items for which bids are to be received. The Contractor shall perform
 all designated temporary work as indicated on the plans or provided in the Contract or as
 directed by the Engineer at the time and in the manner deemed to provide the most
 effective deterrent to siltation.
 Any emergency temporary erosion control will be authorized and used only under
 conditions or causes created solely by the State or unforeseeable causes beyond the
 control of the Contractor. The Engineer shall be the sole judge as to the use and payment
 of emergency temporary erosion control work. Unforeseen special emergency erosion
 control features not contemplated in the plans or contract documents and determined by
 the Engineer to be essential for the prevention of siltation and pollution for conditions or
 causes created solely by the State or unforeseeable causes beyond the control of the
 Contractor shall be performed as Extra Work.
 107.22.6--All Operations. It shall be fully understood that nothing in this subsection
 shall be construed in any manner to relieve the Contractor from any of the responsibilities
 for the establishment of permanent roadside development items and other permanent
 work specified for erosion control in the sequence and manner included in other
 provisions and requirements of the Contract.
 107.22.7--Quarantine Information. At the request of the U. S. Department of
 Agriculture, plant pest control information concerning domestic quarantines is cited as
 follows:
 The entire state of Mississippi has been quarantined for the Imported Fire Ants. Soil and
 soil-moving equipment operating in the state will be subject to plant quarantine
 regulations. In general, these regulations provide for cleaning soil from equipment before
 it is moved from the state. Complete information may be secured from the State of
 Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, Bureau of Plant Industry, P. O.

 Agent for assistance regarding exact areas under regulation and requirements for moving
 regulated articles. For detailed information, see 7 CFR 301.81 for quarantine and
 regulations.
 107.22.8--Gopher Tortoises. The Contractor will be required to make special
 considerations regarding gopher tortoises on projects in Clarke, Covington, Forrest,
 George, Greene, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson Davis, Jones, Lamar,
 Marion, Pearl River, Perry, Smith, Stone, Walthall, and Wayne Counties that require the
 use of a borrow or disposal land areas. In addition to the normal required documentation
 associated with borrow pits, the Contractor shall, for each site used to obtain or dispose
 of materials associated with this project, provide the Engineer with a letter from a
 qualified biologist certifying that the site was inspected prior to any clearing of
 vegetation or disposal of project materials and that the site is not inhabited by gopher
 
 69
 
 Section 107
 
 Section 107
 
 tortoises, or appropriate avoidance measures have been installed. No individual lacking
 the proper State or Federal license shall touch or otherwise harass a gopher tortoise.
 107.23--Material Pits. The Contractor is reminded of the Mississippi Surface Mining
 and Reclamation Act and the Rules and Regulations adopted to implement this act.
 Questions or problems concerning the Act or the Rules and Regulations should be
 directed to the MDEQ, Office of Geology, Jackson, Mississippi.
 Prior to opening a new pit or enlarging an existing pit, the Contractor will furnish the
 Engineer either a copy of the "Notification of Exempt Operations" or a copy of the
 (permanent or temporary) Class II Permit approval from the MDEQ Office of Geology.
 The Contractor shall also obtain a letter stating that the pit site is satisfactory from an
 archaeological and historical standpoint from the Mississippi Department of Archives and
 History, Historic Preservation Division, Jackson, Mississippi. All costs involved in
 obtaining clearance shall be borne by the Contractor. Delays encountered in obtaining
 clearance will not be a reason for extension of contract time. This requirement is not
 applicable to commercial sources.
 When the Contract requires the Contractor to dispose of excavated material, the
 Contractor shall, prior to removal, furnish the Engineer with a copy of a letter from the
 land owner stating that the Contractor has the right to place material on said property.
 The Contractor shall also furnish the Engineer with a letter stating that the property is not
 in a wetland. Delays encountered in obtaining this information will not be a reason for
 extension of contract time. This requirement is not applicable to commercial sources.
 The Contractor is further reminded of and shall comply with the requirements of the
 Clean Water Act Amendments requiring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
 System (NPDES) permits for discharges composed entirely of storm water from active or
 inactive surface mining operations, excluding work areas covered by a U. S. Army Corps
 of Engineers Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit. Questions or problems concerning
 NPDES permits should be directed to the MDEQ, Office of Pollution Control, Industrial
 Branch, Jackson, Mississippi.
 The Contractor shall, before a regulated area is opened or enlarged as a material pit,
 obtain from MDEQ the necessary Mining Storm Water NPDES Permit(s) authorizing the
 discharge of storm water subject to the terms and conditions of said permit. The
 Contractor shall furnish the Engineer a copy of the MDEQ NPDES permit. All costs
 involved in obtaining the permit(s) shall be borne by the Contractor. Delays encountered
 in obtaining the permit(s) will not be a reason for extension of contract time.
 For regulated commercial sources, the owner(s) shall bear the responsibility for meeting
 the requirements of the NPDES permitting process.
 107.24--Construction Noise Abatement. The Contractor shall comply with all state and
 local sound control and noise level rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to any
 work performed pursuant to the Contract.
 Each internal combustion engine, used for any purpose on the work or related to the
 work, shall be equipped with a muffler of a type recommended by the manufacturer. No
 internal combustion engine shall be operated on the project without such muffler.

 Section 107
 
 Section 107
 
 107.25--Hazardous and/or Toxic Waste Procedures. No matter how extensive a field
 investigation, the possibility exists that hazardous and/or toxic wastes on a site will go
 undetected until excavation is initiated. If underground storage tank (UST), buried
 containers, hazardous and/or toxic substances are uncovered, or even suspected, during
 construction, work in this area shall be immediately discontinued and measures taken to
 protect susceptible nearby wetlands or ground-water sources, and the Engineer shall be
 immediately notified.
 It is essential that the suspected hazardous substances be left in place until they have been
 identified. The Contractor shall make every effort to prevent the Contractor’s personnel,
 State personnel and the general public from becoming exposed to substances that may be
 hazardous or toxic. Once contaminated soil or debris has been removed from the ground
 and leaves the site, it is considered a hazardous waste if the concentration exceeds
 regulatory levels. In such cases, the Contractor becomes a hazardous waste generator.
 Disposition of USTs, containers, hazardous and/or toxic waste shall be in accordance
 with current rules and regulations of the MDEQ, Office of Pollution Control.
 The Contractor shall report to the Engineer and the Office of Pollution Control any
 evidence or conditions that may cause suspicion that a waste site of hazardous or toxic
 materials and/or containers or USTs has been located within right-of-way limits of the
 project. Work shall cease immediately at such suspected site and shall not resume until
 directed by the Engineer.
 When the Contractor is required to perform additional work to dispose of such waste,
 containers and/or USTs, payment will be made at contract unit prices applicable to the
 work and/or as provided in Subsection 109.04 when the Contract does not include
 appropriate pay items.
 The Department reserves the right to use other forces for exploratory work to identify and
 determine the extent of hazardous and/or toxic waste. Should the disposition of such
 material require special procedures by certified personnel, the Department will make
 arrangements with qualified persons to dispose of the material.
 When the existence of USTs are known in advance of construction activity, the
 Contractor shall give the Office of Pollution Control written notification 30 days in
 advance of removal.
 When a UST contains or has been used for containment of a regulated substance and the
 Contractor is required to remove such tank in accordance with the provisions of
 Subsection 104.05, the Contractor shall not use "flotation" as a method of removal.
 
 SECTION 108 - PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 108.01--Subletting of Contract.
 108.01.1--General. The total value of all work performed by the Contractor's own
 organization shall be no less than 40 percent of the value of the remaining work after
 subtracting the Contract value of the specialty items from the value of the original
 Contract.
 
 71
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 The Contractor's "own organization" shall be construed to include workmen employed
 and paid directly, owned or rented equipment and trucks that are classed as owneroperator.
 All items that have been selected as specialty items will be listed as such in contract
 documents.
 The Contractor shall not sublet any portion of the Contract or work provided therein,
 except the furnishing of necessary materials, without the approval of the Executive
 Director. Approval to sublet any portion of the Contract or work to a Contractor that the
 Department refuses to issue a proposal, in accordance with Section 102, will not be
 granted.
 Consideration may be given to requests to sublet a portion of the total value of a contract
 pay item. When the Contractor proposes to sublet a portion of a pay item, the
 Contractor’s request shall be accompanied by a breakdown of the costs of the various
 components of each pay item, including haul if applicable, that is proposed to be sublet
 by part.
 Computation of the percentage of the work sublet shall be based on the contract price of
 each item or in the case of subletting a part of a pay item, the percentage shall be based
 on the amount acceptably established by the Contractor.
 The simple expediency of carrying the workmen of one Contractor on the Contractor's or
 approved subcontractor's payroll to avoid subcontracting will not be permitted.
 If evidence and investigation establish that a violation of the subcontract requirement is
 being attempted through subterfuge whereby one Contractor's equipment is leased to the
 Contractor, except as provided in Subsection 108.01.2, or the workmen of one Contractor
 are placed on the payroll of the Contractor, the Executive Director will take such action
 as deemed appropriate under the provisions of the Contract and may suspend the bidding
 qualifications of those found to be in violation for a period of up to one year. This
 provision does not include the lease or use of equipment from a corporation or company
 wholly owned by the Contractor.
 Subcontracting does not release the Contractor of bond and Contract liability and shall
 not be construed to imply that a Contract exists between the Department and a third party.
 The Contractor must pay subcontractor(s) for satisfactory performance of their contracts
 no later than 15 calendar days from receipt of payment from the Department. Within 15
 calendar days after receiving payment from the Department for work satisfactorily
 performed, the Contractor shall make prompt payment to all Subcontractors or material
 suppliers for all monies due. Within 15 calendar days after receiving payment from the
 Department for work satisfactorily completed, the Contractor shall promptly return all
 retainage monies due to all Subcontractors or material suppliers. The Engineer may
 suspend the work wholly or in part and withhold payments because of the Contractor's
 failure to make prompt payment within 15 calendar days as required above, or failure to
 submit the required OCR-484 Form, Certification of Payments to Subcontractors, which
 is also designed to comply with prompt payment requirements.

 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 108.01.2--Work Performed by Equipment Rental Agreement. Work may be
 performed by equipment operated under Department approved rental agreements
 independent of the provisions of Subsection 108.01.1.
 Trucks that are licensed for operation on the highways of Mississippi are excluded from
 prior approval of rental agreements under this provision. For other equipment prior
 approval of a rental agreement shall be obtained in writing before the equipment is used
 on the work. Consideration for approval will be made by the Resident or Project
 Engineer, District or Central Office, depending on the nature and scope of the proposed
 rental agreement and the administrative procedures established by the Department.
 At least one of the following qualified conditions is a prerequisite for approval of
 equipment rental:
 (a) Equipment may be rented from a dealer or firm in the business of selling,
 renting or leasing equipment when the firm or dealer is not a highway
 Contractor or Subcontractor. In the event, the dealer or firm is a Contractor or
 Subcontractor, consideration for approval will be given under one of the
 subsequent conditions.
 (b) Equipment may be rented from another Contractor provided such Contractor
 does not have a Contract with the Department or an approved subcontract; or the
 Contractor or Subcontractor is maintaining satisfactory progress on all work
 under Contract or subcontract, and the equipment proposed to be rented is not
 essential to the maintenance of satisfactory progress.
 (c) An occasional piece of equipment may be rented from any party for valid
 reasons such as breakdown of Contractor owned equipment, temporary need for
 equipment not normally anticipated for the type of work to be performed or for
 temporary need for special equipment not normally owned for the type of work
 involved.
 For any work proposed to be performed by rental equipment, the Contractor shall in
 advance of such use notify the Resident or Project Engineer on the Department's Standard
 Equipment Rental Request form. The notification shall contain a list and description of
 equipment, the name of the supplier, the rental rate to be paid, the estimated time use, and
 the affirmation shown on the form.
 In no circumstance shall a Contractor be entitled to any damages for rental or rental rates
 of equipment where the advanced notification is not given to the Resident or Project
 Engineer, and the failure to provide the advanced notice shall constitute a waiver of any
 such claims.
 Lease-rental agreements shall provide reimbursement based on time or in the case of
 trucks: ton, cubic yard, ton-mile, cubic yard-mile, etc. Equipment and operators, if
 included, shall be under the sole direction of the Contractor in the performance of the
 work.
 If approval has been granted for renting equipment from a Contractor that has work under
 Contract or subcontract with the Department and the progress on the other work becomes
 unsatisfactory, the approval shall become null and void. Continued work with the rented
 equipment shall not be performed except under qualified approval in writing by the
 Executive Director.
 
 73
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 108.02--Notice to Proceed. The Contractor shall not begin construction on any feature
 of the work before a Notice to Proceed is issued.
 The anticipated date of the Notice to Proceed / the Beginning of Contract Time will be
 specified in the proposal.
 If the Department delays the issuance of the Notice to Proceed, the Beginning of Contract
 Time will be adjusted equal to the number of calendar days of the delay. When the
 revised date falls on Sunday or a holiday the following day will be the Beginning of
 Contract Time. The contract time will be extended as provided in Subsection 108.06.
 Upon written request from the Contractor and if circumstances permit, the Notice to
 Proceed may be issued at an earlier date subject to the conditions stated therein. The
 Contractor shall not be entitled to any monetary damages or extension of contract time
 for any delay claim or claim of inefficiency occurring between the early issuance Notice
 To Proceed date and the Notice to Proceed date stated in the Contract.
 Failure of the Contractor to commence work by the date specified for the beginning of
 contract time or within a reasonable time thereafter may be cause for annulment of the
 Contract.
 108.03--Prosecution and Progress.
 108.03.1--Progress Schedule. On working day projects, the Department will furnish the
 Contractor a progress schedule developed for the determination of contract time that may
 be used as the contract progress schedule, or the Contractor’s own proposed progress
 schedule may be submitted for approval. If the Contractor elects to furnish a progress
 schedule for approval by the Engineer, it should be furnished promptly after award of the
 Contract. In the event the Contractor has not submitted an approvable progress schedule
 by the beginning of contract time, the progress schedule prepared by the Department shall
 be the acceptable progress schedule and used to assess contract time.
 On completion date projects which include A + B projects and on A + C projects, the
 Contractor shall furnish a progress schedule and be prepared to discuss both its proposed
 methodologies for fulfilling the scheduling requirements and its sequence of operations.
 The Engineer will review Contractor prepared progress schedules and approve schedules
 as they relate to compliance with the specifications and logic. The progress schedule
 must be approved by the Engineer prior to commencing work. The progress schedule
 shall be a computer generated bar-chart type schedule meeting the below minimum
 requirements. These activities shall be significantly detailed enough to communicate the
 Contractor's understanding of the construction sequencing and phasing of the project.
 An approved progress schedule shall be in effect until the date on which a revised
 schedule is approved. The approved progress schedule will be the basis for contract time
 assessment.
 When preparing the progress schedule, the Contractor shall include the following:

 All activities in the order the work is to be performed including submittals,
 submittal reviews, fabrication and delivery.
 All activities that are controlling factors in the completion of the work.
 The time needed to perform each activity and its relationship in time to other
 activities.
 
 The progress schedule shall provide a bar for each major phase of construction such as,
 but not limited to, clearing and grubbing, grading, drainage structures, bridges, base,
 shoulders, paving, etc. with an estimated start working day and completion working day
 for each bar, all within the specified contract time.
 The Contractor will be required to submit monthly progress schedule updates on all
 projects with a contract time duration of more than eight (8) months.
 The Engineer may request the submittal of a revised progress schedule within 10 days of
 the occurrence of any of the following conditions. If the Contractor fails to submit the
 requested schedule, the Engineer may withhold the future monthly estimates or portions
 thereof.

 When a Critical Path Method (CPM) schedule is required in the proposal, this schedule
 will be used in lieu of the bar graph progress schedule in evaluating work progress. In
 such case, the same time frame noted in this subsection for the original submittal along
 with the update requirements will apply.
 108.03.2--Preconstruction Conference. Prior to commencement of the work, a
 preconstruction conference shall be held for the purpose of discussing with the Contractor
 essential matters pertaining to the prosecution and satisfactory completion of the work.
 The Contractor in conjunction with the Engineer will schedule the date of the
 preconstruction conference. The Contractor will advise the Project Engineer in writing as
 to the date of the conference. When the Contract requires the Contractor to have a
 certified erosion control person, the Contractor’s certified erosion control person must be
 at the preconstruction conference. The Department will arrange for utility representatives
 and other affected parties to be present.
 If requested by either the Contractor or the Engineer, arrangements will be made for their
 authorized representatives to inspect the project site with plans in hand and carefully
 observe pertinent conditions relating to the project, including the status of right-of-way,
 railroad, utilities and any other special features.
 108.03.3--Commencement and Execution of Work. The work shall begin as set out in
 
 75
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 the contract documents or approved progress schedule or as directed and shall be
 prosecuted at the rate necessary to ensure its completion within the contract time. During
 the progress of the work, the Engineer shall be notified sufficiently in advance of the time
 the Contractor expects to undertake particular features of construction to permit the
 required layout and inspection. Should particular phases of the work be discontinued by
 the Contractor, the Engineer shall be notified at least 24 hours in advance of resuming
 operations.
 All work covered by a Supplemental Agreement shall not commence until the
 Supplemental Agreement has been properly executed by all parties.
 108.04--Limitations of Operations.
 108.04.1--General. Work requiring the presence or services of Department personnel
 will not be permitted on Sunday, New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
 Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract or the Engineer determines that an emergency or necessity exists. Work on
 these days, in lieu of supplemental equipment and labor, solely to complete the project
 within contract time will not be considered a necessity or emergency.
 Drainage and minor structures shall be completed ahead of grading to ensure proper
 setting and curing, thorough compaction of backfill, and improved soil conditions for
 proper embankment construction.
 If the Contractor initiates construction on a greater portion of the work than is necessary
 for proper prosecution or is carrying on operations to the prejudice of construction
 already started, the Engineer may require the Contractor to finish the construction in
 progress before additional portions of construction are started. Work shall be conducted
 in the manner and sequence necessary to provide for public convenience and safety as set
 out in Subsection 107.07.
 Unless otherwise specified in the contract, lane closures will not be allowed during the
 following holiday periods.
 Memorial Day -------------- On the preceding Friday through Memorial Day
 Independence Day --------- July 3rd, July 4th, and any adjacent days that fall on a
 weekend
 Labor Day ------------------- On the preceding Friday through Labor Day
 Thanksgiving --------------- On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving through the
 Sunday following Thanksgiving
 Christmas/New Year’s ---- December 24th through January 1st and any adjacent days
 that fall on a weekend
 108.04.2--Night Work. When early completion of a particular phase of construction is
 for public benefit or in the case of emergencies, the Engineer may permit construction
 after daylight hours unless specifically prohibited by the Contract. If night work is
 permitted, the Contractor shall provide sufficient illumination to satisfy the requirements
 of Section 680, and the work performed under these conditions shall comply in every
 respect with the terms and conditions of the Contract.
 108.04.3--Temporary Suspension of Work. The Engineer will have the authority to
 
 76
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 suspend the work wholly or in part for as long as necessary because of unsuitable
 weather, unusually heavy traffic, conditions unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution
 of the work, failure of the Contractor to carry out instructions or to perform all provisions
 of the Contract. If it becomes necessary to stop work for an indefinite period, the
 Contractor shall store all materials so they will not obstruct or impede the traveling public
 or become damaged in any way. The Contractor shall take every precaution to prevent
 damage or deterioration of the work, provide suitable drainage of the roadway and erect
 temporary structures where necessary. An adjustment in contract time, as applicable, will
 be made for phases of suspended work except during suspension for failure to carry out
 instructions of the Engineer. Additional compensation will not be paid because of such
 suspension, except as provided below. The Contractor shall not suspend work without
 written authority from the Engineer.
 If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the
 Engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated,
 customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the Contractor believes that
 additional compensation and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or
 delay, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing, in accordance with the
 method set out in Subsection 104.02.4.
 108.05--Character of Workers, Methods, and Equipment. The Contractor shall
 employ competent and efficient laborers, mechanics, or artisans. Whenever an employee
 is deemed to be careless or incompetent, obstructs the progress of the work, is
 intemperate, uncooperative or disorderly, the Contractor shall, upon written request of the
 Engineer, discharge or otherwise remove said employee from the work and shall not
 reemploy such person without the written consent of the Engineer.
 The methods used in performing the construction, and all equipment, tools and
 machinery, shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer before and during
 construction. All equipment, tools and machinery used shall be maintained in a
 satisfactory working condition.
 The measure of the capacity and efficiency of machinery and equipment shall be its
 actual performance on the work. Should it become apparent that the progress of
 construction is such that the Contractor will be unable to complete the work with the
 available equipment within contract time, additional equipment meeting the approval of
 the Engineer may be required.
 Permission to use alternative equipment or methods may be granted when it is of a new
 or improved type, and its use is deemed by the Engineer to be in furtherance of the intent
 of these specifications. Continued use shall be contingent upon the capability to produce
 work consistently equal to, or better than, that which can be produced with the equipment
 or method specified.
 Nothing in this subsection shall relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for producing
 work of the quality specified in the Contract. Should the Contractor continue to employ
 or re-employ such unsatisfactory person or persons as herein described, fail to furnish
 suitable and sufficient machinery, equipment or forces for the proper prosecution of the
 work, all estimates may be withheld until the Engineer’s orders are complied with, or the
 Contract may be terminated as hereinafter provided.

 Section 108
 
 108.06--Determination and Extension of Contract Time.
 108.06.1--Based on Working Day Completion.
 108.06.1.1--General. Contract time will be established on the basis of an allowable
 number of Working Days, as indicated in the Contract. Contract time for A + C projects
 shall be determined by the Bidder based on the cost to construction the project (A) and
 the number of working days to complete the project (C). For A + C Contracts, the span
 of contract time shall be the time between the date of the Beginning of Contract Time and
 the date representing the number of working days determined by the Contractor to
 complete the work.
 A working day is defined as a day the Contractor worked or could have worked in
 accordance with the conditions set forth in Subsection 108.06.1.2, Subparagraphs (a) and
 (b), except during the months of December, January, and February.
 During the months of December, January, and February, time will be assessed regardless
 of whether or not the Contractor actually works. The value for the time on any particular
 day will be determined by dividing the number of anticipated working day shown in the
 following table by the number of days in the particular month. This number will be
 expressed to three decimal places (0.000)
 The span of time allowed for the completion of the work included in the Contract will be
 indicated in the contract documents and will be known as "Contract Time.”
 108.06.1.2--Contract Time. The following TABLE OF ANTICIPATED WORKING
 DAYS indicates an average/anticipated number of working days per month.

 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 On projects other than A + C projects, Available working days will be assessed from the
 original Notice to Proceed/Beginning of Contract Time date shown in the contract
 documents, regardless of whether or not the Contractor has been issued an early Notice to
 Proceed. On A + C projects, available working days will be assessed from the original
 Notice to Proceed/Beginning of Contract Time date shown in the contract documents, or
 the earlier Notice to Proceed/Beginning of Contract Time date if an early Notice to
 Proceed is allowed.
 Available working days will be based on soil and weather conditions and other specific
 conditions cited in the Contract. The Engineer will determine on each applicable day the
 extent to which work in progress could have been productive, regardless of whether the
 Contractor actually worked.
 An available working day will be assessed as follows:
 (a) any day of the week, Monday through Friday, exclusive of legal holidays
 recognized by the Department in Subsection 108.04.1, in which the Contractor
 works or could have worked for more than six (6) consecutive hours on the
 controlling item(s) of work, as determined by the Engineer from the approved
 progress schedule. When the Contractor works or could work more than four but
 less than six consecutive hours, one-half (0.5) of an available work day will be
 charged for that day. When the Contractor works or could work six or more
 consecutive hours during the day, one (1.0) available work day will be charged for
 that day, and
 (b) any Saturday, exclusive of legal holidays recognized by the Department in
 Subsection 108.04.1, in which the Contractor works for more than six (6)
 consecutive hours on the controlling item(s) of work, as determined by the
 Engineer from the approved progress schedule. When the Contractor works less
 than four consecutive hours during the day, no time will be charged for that day.
 When the Contractor works more than four but less than six consecutive hours,
 one-half (0.5) of an available work day will be charged for that day. When the
 Contractor works six or more consecutive hours during the day, one (1.0) available
 work day will be charged for that day.
 Should the weather or other conditions be such that four (4) consecutive satisfactory
 hours are not available prior to noon (for daytime operations) or midnight (for nighttime
 operations), no time will be assessed for that day regardless of the above conditions.
 However, if the Contractor elects to work, time will be assessed in accordance with the
 previous paragraph.
 Time will not be charged during any required waiting period for placement of permanent
 pavement markings as set forth in Subsection 618.03 provided all other work is complete
 except growth and coverage of vegetative items as provided in Subsection 210.01.
 Each month the Engineer will complete, and furnish to the Contractor, an "Assessment
 Report of Working Days" (CSD-765). This report shows the number of working days
 assessed during the estimate period and the cumulative working days assessed to date.
 The Contractor should review the Engineer's report as to the accuracy of the assessment
 and confer with the Resident or Project Engineer to rectify any differences. Each should
 make a record of the differences, if any, and conclusions reached. In the event mutual
 
 79
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 agreement cannot be reached, the Contractor has 15 calendar days following the ending
 date of the monthly report in question to file a protest Notice of Claim in accordance with
 the provisions of Subsection 104.02.4. Otherwise, the Engineer's assessment shall be
 final unless mathematical errors of assessment are subsequently found to exist, and any
 claim of the Contractor as to such matter shall be waived.
 The Contractor’s progress will be determined monthly at the time of each progress
 estimate and will be based on the percentage of money earned by the Contractor
 compared to the percentage of elapsed time.
 The percentage of money earned will be determined by comparing the total money
 earned to-date by the Contractor, minus any payment for advancement of materials, to the
 total dollar amount of the Contract. The percentage of time elapsed will be determined
 by comparing the working days assessed to-date on Form CSD-765 to the total allowable
 working days for the Contract.
 When the "percent complete" lags more than 20 percent behind the "percentage of
 elapsed time", the Engineer will notify the Contractor that they have seven (7) calendar
 days to submit a written statement and revised progress schedule indicating any
 additional equipment, labor, materials, etc. to be assigned to the work to ensure
 completion within the specified contract time. Failure to submit the revised schedule
 may result in the withholding of the monthly estimate. When the "percent complete" lags
 more than 40 percent behind the "percentage of elapsed time", the Contract may be
 terminated.
 108.06.1.3--Extension of Time. The Contractor may, prior to the expiration of the
 contract time, make a written request to the Engineer for an extension of contract time, in
 accordance with Subsection 104.02.4, with a valid justification for the request. The
 Contractor's plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of
 contract time.
 An extension of contract time may be granted for unforeseen utility delays, abnormal
 delays caused solely by the State or other governmental authorities, or unforeseeable
 disastrous phenomena of nature of the magnitude of earthquakes, hurricanes, named
 tropical storms, tornadoes, or flooded essential work areas that are deemed to
 unavoidably prevent prosecuting the work.
 The span of contract time allowed in the Contract as awarded is based on the quantities
 used for comparison of bids. If satisfactory fulfillment of the Contract requires
 performance of work in greater quantities than those set forth in the proposal, the time
 allowed for completion shall be increased in Working Days in the same ratio that the cost
 of such added work, exclusive of the cost of work altered by Supplemental Agreement
 for which a time adjustment is made for such altered work in the Supplemental
 Agreement, bears to the total value of the original Contract unless it can be established
 that the extra work was of such character that it required more time than is indicated by
 the money value.
 Any extension of contract time will be on a working day basis.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient materials, equipment and labor to guarantee the
 completion of the contract work in accordance with the plans and specifications within
 
 80
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 the contract time.
 If the contract time of the project is extended into a season of the year in which
 completion of certain items of work would be prohibited or delayed because of seasonal
 or temperature limitations, the Engineer may waive the limitations provided the
 completion of the work will not result in a reduction in quality. When determined that
 the completion of the out-of-season items will cause a reduction in the quality of the
 work, the completion of the project will be further extended so the items may be
 completed under favorable weather conditions. In either case, the Engineer will notify
 the Contractor in writing.
 Liquidated damages as set forth in Subsection 108.07 under the heading "Daily Charge
 Per Calendar Day" in the Table titled "Schedule of Deductions for Each Day of Overrun
 in Contract Time", shall be applicable to each calendar day after the specified completion
 date, or authorized extension thereof, and until all work under the Contract is completed.
 108.06.1.4--Cessation of Contract Time. When all items of work are complete to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer and the Engineer has been advised by the Contractor that a
 final inspection is desired, time will be suspended until the final inspection is conducted
 and for an additional 14 satisfactory days after the Contractor has been notified in writing
 of the results of the inspection. If after the end of the 14-day suspension all necessary
 items of work have not been completed, time charges will resume. If the specified
 completion date had not been reached at the time the Contractor called for a final
 inspection, the calendar day difference between the specified completion date and the
 date the Contractor called for a final inspection will be added after the 14-day period
 before starting liquidation damages. If a project is on liquidated damages at the time a
 final inspection is scheduled, liquidated damages will be suspended until the final
 inspection is conducted and for seven (7) calendar days after the Contractor has been
 notified in writing of the results of the inspection. If after the end of the 7-day suspension
 all necessary items of work have not been completed, liquidated damages will resume.
 When final inspection has been made by the Engineer as prescribed in Subsection 105.20
 and all items of work have been completed, the daily time charge will cease.
 108.06.2--Based on Specified Completion Date.
 108.06.2.1--General. Contract time will be established on the basis of a Specified
 Completion Date indicated in the Contract, or as determined by the Contractor in
 accordance with the contract documents. The span of time allowed for the completion of
 the work included in the Contract will be known as "Contract Time.”
 For Contracts in which a Specified Completion Date is indicated in the Contract, the span
 of contract time shall be between the date of the Beginning of Contract Time and the
 Specified Completion Date indicated in the Contract.
 Contract time for A + B projects shall be determined by the Bidder based on the cost to
 construction the project (A) and the number of calendar days to complete the project (B).
 For A + B Contracts, the span of contract time shall be the time between the date of the
 Beginning of Contract Time and the date representing the number of Calendar Days
 determined by the Contractor to complete the work. The contract time which is
 determined by the Contractor on A + B projects shall include time for the required
 waiting periods for placement of permanent pavement markings and all necessary burn-in
 
 81
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 periods for electrical items.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient materials, equipment and labor to guarantee the
 completion of the contract work in accordance with the plans and specifications within
 the contract time.
 At any given date, the ratio of the accumulated monetary value of that part of the work
 actually accomplished to the total Contract bid amount adjusted to reflect approved
 increases or decreases shall determine the "percent complete" of the work.
 The Contractor’s progress will be determined monthly at the time of each progress
 estimate and will be based on the percentage of money earned by the Contractor
 compared to the percentage of elapsed time.
 The percentage of money earned will be determined by comparing the total money
 earned to-date by the Contractor, minus any payment for advancement of materials, to the
 total dollar amount of the Contract. The percentage elapsed time shall be calculated as a
 direct ratio of the expired Calendar Days to the total Calendar Days provided for in the
 Contract.
 When the "percent complete" lags more than 20 percent behind the "percentage of
 elapsed time", the Engineer will notify the Contractor that they have seven (7) calendar
 days to submit a written statement and revised progress schedule indicating any
 additional equipment, labor, materials, etc. to be assigned to the work to ensure
 completion within the specified contract time. Failure to submit the revised schedule
 may result in the withholding of the monthly estimate. When the "percent complete" lags
 more than 40 percent behind the "percentage of elapsed time", the Contract may be
 terminated.
 108.06.2.2--Extension of Time. The Contractor may, prior to the expiration of the
 contract time, make a written request to the Engineer for an extension of contract time
 with a valid justification for the request in accordance with Subsection 104.02.4. The
 Contractor's plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of
 contract time.
 On all completion date Contracts, an extension of contract time may be granted for
 unforeseen utility delays, abnormal delays caused solely by the State or other
 governmental authorities, or unforeseeable disastrous phenomena of nature of the
 magnitude of earthquakes, hurricanes, named tropical storms, tornadoes, or flooded
 essential work areas that are deemed to unavoidably prevent prosecuting the work.
 The span of time allowed in the Contract as awarded is based on the quantities used for
 comparison of bids. If satisfactory fulfillment of the Contract requires performance of
 work in greater quantities than those set forth in the proposal, the time allowed for
 completion shall be increased in Calendar Days in the same ratio that the cost of such
 added work, exclusive of the cost of work altered by Supplemental Agreement for which
 a time adjustment is made for such altered work in the Supplemental Agreement, bears to
 the total value of the original Contract unless it can be established that the extra work was
 of such character that it required more time than is indicated by the money value.
 Any extension of contract time will be based on a calendar day basis, excluding
 
 82
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays recognized by the Department in Subsection
 108.04.1. Any extension of contract time on A + B Contracts will be based on a calendar
 day basis, excluding those days in the Contract that restricted the Contractor from
 working.
 If the contract time of the project is extended into a season of the year in which
 completion of certain items of work would be prohibited or delayed because of seasonal
 or temperature limitations, the Engineer may waive the limitations provided the
 completion of the work will not result in a reduction in quality. When determined that
 the completion of the out-of-season items will cause a reduction in the quality of the
 work, the completion of the project may be further extended so the items may be
 completed under favorable weather conditions. In either case, the Engineer will notify
 the Contractor in writing.
 Liquidated damages as set forth in Subsection 108.07 under the heading "Daily Charge
 Per Calendar Day" in the Table titled "Schedule of Deductions for Each Day of Overrun
 in Contract Time", shall be applicable to each calendar day after the specified completion
 date, or authorized extension thereof, and until all work under the Contract is completed.
 108.06.2.3--Cessation of Contract Time. When all items of work are complete to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer and the Engineer has been advised by the Contractor that a
 final inspection is desired, time will be suspended until the final inspection is conducted
 and for an additional 14 calendar days after the Contractor has been notified in writing of
 the results of the inspection. If after the end of the 14-day suspension all necessary items
 of work have not been completed, time charges will resume. If the specified completion
 date had not been reached at the time the Contractor called for a final inspection, the
 calendar day difference between the specified completion date and the date the
 Contractor called for a final inspection will be added after the 14-day period before
 starting liquidation damages. If a project is on liquidated damages at the time a final
 inspection is scheduled, liquidated damages will be suspended until the final inspection is
 conducted and for seven (7) calendar days after the Contractor has been notified in
 writing of the results of the inspection. If after the end of the 7-day suspension all
 necessary items of work have not been completed, liquidated damages will resume.
 When final inspection has been made by the Engineer as prescribed in Subsection 105.20
 and all items of work have been completed, the daily time charge will cease.
 108.07--Failure to Complete the Work on Time. When the Contractor fails to
 complete the work within the time stipulated or as extended under the provisions of the
 Contract, a deduction calculated from the daily charges listed in the below schedule will
 be made from money due the Contractor not as a penalty but as liquidated damages. The
 daily charges set out in the schedule of liquidated damages are based on an approximate
 average cost to the Department for maintaining Engineers, Inspectors and other
 employees. The Contractor and the Contractor’s Sureties shall be liable for all liquidated
 damages in excess of money due the Contractor.

 The applicable daily charge will be made for each calendar day after the expiration of
 contract time. With the exception of A + B contracts as noted in Subsection 108.06.2.1,
 daily charges, as shown above, will not be made during any required waiting period for
 placement of permanent pavement markings as set forth in Subsection 618.03 provided
 all other work is complete and during specified growth and coverage of the vegetative
 items as provided in Subsection 210.01.
 108.08--Default and Termination of Contract. The Contract may be terminated by the
 Executive Director for any of the following reasons:
 (a) Failure to proceed with the work when so instructed by the Department or to
 adhere to the requirements of the Contract.
 (b) Failure to perform the work with sufficient workmen, equipment and materials
 to assure completion within contract time.
 (c) Performing unacceptable work, or neglecting or refusing to remove materials or
 to perform anew such work as may be rejected as unacceptable.
 (d) Discontinuing the prosecution of the work.
 (e) Violation of labor provisions and special regulations.
 (f) Becoming insolvent, being declared bankrupt or committing any act of
 bankruptcy or insolvency.
 (g) Allowing a final judgment to stand unsatisfied.
 (h) Making an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
 (i) Failure for any other cause whatsoever to carry on the work in an acceptable
 manner.
 Before the Contract is terminated, the Contractor and Surety will be notified in writing by
 either the Project Engineer or the Executive Director of the Department’s intent to
 declare the Contractor in Default and terminate the Contract. If, for any reason, written
 notice cannot be delivered to the Contractor, notice of termination may be given by
 publication in a newspaper in the county in which the project is located. When there is
 no such newspaper, the notice may be given by publication in a newspaper located in
 Hinds County. If no satisfactory effort has been made by the Contractor or Surety to
 correct the conditions enumerated in the notice within 15 calendar days after notice is
 given, the Executive Director may declare the Contract terminated and notify the
 Contractor and Surety accordingly.
 Upon receipt of notice from the Executive Director that the Contract has been terminated,
 the Contractor shall immediately discontinue all operations.
 
 84
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 After termination, the Executive Director will order the Surety to arrange for the
 prosecution of the work. If the Surety does not proceed with the satisfactory prosecution
 of the work within 20 calendar days from the date on which the Contract was terminated,
 the Executive Director may proceed by either re-advertising and awarding the Contract,
 or proceed in any other lawful manner that will provide for the completion of the work as
 planned and set forth in the Contract. The Surety or the Department, at the Surety's
 expense, will perform or arrange for necessary maintenance between the date of
 termination and the date that work is resumed. The Surety shall not tender the
 completion of the Work to the Contractor without the written authorization of the
 Engineer or the Executive Director.
 When the work is finally completed, the total cost to the Department will be computed.
 If the total cost is greater than the cost that would have resulted at the original contract
 unit prices, the extra expense will be the responsibility of the original Contractor's Surety.
 If the total cost is less than the cost that would have resulted at the original contract unit
 prices, the savings will be paid to the original Contractor's Surety.
 108.09--Termination of Contract for Reasons Other Than Default. The Department
 may, by written notice, with the approval of the FHWA where applicable, terminate any
 Contract, or any portion thereof for the Department’s convenience, when it is determined
 that a termination is in the best interest of the Department.
 Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to:
 (a) Insufficient funds by the Department due to extenuating circumstances;
 (b) Occurrence of an environmental situation of a significant nature that would require
 extensive and time-consuming delays in the work for the purposes of
 identification, evaluation, and possibly mitigation;
 (c) Occurrence of a previously undiscovered error in the bid documents; and
 (d) Any other circumstances the Department determines to be in the best interest of
 the Department or the public.
 In addition to the general reservation of the right to terminate for convenience under this
 Subsection, the bidding documents may provide for a termination of the Contract for
 convenience under this subsection upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified
 event after bid opening.
 Under any of the above circumstances for termination, the Engineer will deliver to the
 Contractor and the Surety a written notice of termination for reasons that will be set forth
 therein. The notice shall specify the extent to which performance of work is terminated
 under the Contract and the effective date of termination. Unless otherwise directed by
 the Engineer, upon receipt of written notice of termination, the Contractor, or its Surety,
 shall immediately:
 (a) Stop work as directed in the notice;
 (b) Place no further orders or subcontracts for materials, services or facilities except as
 approved by the Engineer to complete work not terminated;
 (c) Terminate all orders and subcontracts for the terminated work.
 (d) Deliver to the Engineer completed or partially completed plans, drawings,
 information and other property required to be furnished under the Contract;
 (e) Take actions that the Engineer directs to protect and preserve Contract-related
 
 85
 
 Section 108
 
 Section 108
 
 property that is in the possession of the Contractor in which the Department has or
 may acquire an interest;
 (f) Provide all other information included in this subsection and as requested by the
 Engineer; and
 (g) Complete all work not terminated.
 If the Department terminates the Contract or any portion thereof before completion of all
 items of Work in the Contract, the Department will make payment for the actual number
 of Contract items completed at the contract unit prices and as mutually agreed as
 provided herein for items or Work partially completed, or will pay on a force account
 basis, as determined by the Engineer. The Department may, in its discretion, purchase
 acceptable Materials ordered by the Contractor or delivered to the project site before the
 date of termination, at actual cost plus delivery cost, including freight, unloading, and
 hauling unless otherwise provided. The materials will become the property of the
 Department. The Contractor must submit the proof of actual cost, as shown by receipted
 bills and actual cost records. If the Engineer does not agree to purchase such materials,
 the Department may reimburse the Contractor for any reasonable restocking fees and
 handling costs incurred by the Contractor in returning unused materials to the vendor. If
 only portions of the work are eliminated, the Department may stop delivery and payment
 for unnecessary materials. The Department will not pay for loss of overhead or
 anticipated profits, including anticipated earnings on usage of owned equipment, or
 impacts, delay, or other direct or indirect costs resulting from the termination.
 If the Work is suspended in advance of the termination date, the Department may
 consider reimbursing the Contractor for such cost items as mobilization, actual idle
 equipment costs for work stopped in advance of the termination date, and guaranteed
 payments for land usage as part of the original Contract when not otherwise include in
 the Contract.
 Termination of a Contract or a portion thereof shall not relieve the Contractor of its
 responsibility for the completed work or work not included in the notice of termination,
 nor shall it relieve the Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claims arising
 out of the Work performed or remaining to be performed. In accordance with Subsection
 105.17, the Contractor must submit, within sixty (60) calendar days of the effective
 termination date, any claim for additional costs as set out above.
 108.10--Termination of Contractor's Responsibility. The Contract will be considered
 complete when all work has been satisfactorily completed, the final inspection made, the
 work accepted by the Executive Director, and the final estimate paid. When the
 Executive Director writes the formal letter of acceptance, the Contractor will be released
 from further obligation except, for any warranty obligations or latent defects within one
 (1) year of final acceptance, as set forth in the Contract performance and payment
 bond(s), or as provided by law.
 
 SECTION 109 - MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109.01--Measurement of Quantities. The measurement and determination of quantities
 for each pay item will be made in general as prescribed hereinafter, and specifically as set
 out under Method of Measurement and Basis of Payment for each respective pay item.
 Actual authorized quantities of work, complete and accepted under the Contract, will be
 
 86
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 measured by the Engineer according to United States standard measures, and in
 accordance with well recognized engineering practices. Unauthorized wastage of
 material will be deducted and only quantities actually incorporated in the completed work
 or ordered to be wasted will be included in the final estimate.
 A station when used as a definition or term of measurement will be 100 linear feet.
 Unless otherwise specified, longitudinal measurements for area computations will be
 made horizontally, and no deductions will be made for individual fixtures having an area
 of nine square feet or less. Unless otherwise specified, transverse measurements for area
 computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 Where the area unit for measurement and payment is specified for erosion control items,
 the measurements will be taken on the slope of the ground to compute the actual surface
 area for payment.
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as altered to fit
 field conditions.
 All items that are measured by the linear foot, such as pipe culverts, guardrail,
 underdrains, etc., will be measured as specified under the Method of Measurement for the
 item unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 No payment will be made for unauthorized excavation. Excavation or embankment
 performed beyond the required neat lines or slope stakes will not be measured for
 payment unless within tolerances specified or otherwise provided.
 In computing volumes of excavation and embankment, the average end area method will
 be used, unless otherwise specified.
 The thickness of plates and galvanized sheets used in the manufacture of corrugated
 metal pipe, metal plate pipe culverts and arches, and metal cribbing will be specified and
 measured in decimal fractions of inches as shown in AASHTO M 36 or M 167.
 When size number is used in the measurement of wire, it will mean the size number
 specified in AASHTO M 32.
 The term ton will mean the short ton consisting of 2000 pounds avoirdupois. All
 materials that are specified for measurement by the ton shall be weighed by competent
 personnel on approved scales set at locations approved by the Engineer or in the case of
 prepackaged materials, the manufacturer's bag weight may be used. If material is shipped
 by rail, the car weight may be accepted provided it is the actual weight of material and
 not minimum car weight used for assessing freight tariff. However, car weights will not
 be acceptable for material to be used in mixing plants. Trucks used to haul material
 being paid for by weight shall be weighed empty daily at such time as the Engineer
 directs, and each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
 Timber, except timber piling, will be measured by the thousand feet board measure
 (MBM) actually incorporated in the structure. Measurement will be based on nominal
 widths and thicknesses and the length of each piece.
 
 87
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 When a complete structure or structural unit, in effect "lump sum" work, is specified as
 the unit of measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and
 accessories.
 Volumes of materials computed in cubic yards by the average end area method are
 designated as "Final Measure" (FM), or "Final Measure - Embankment" (FME).
 Volumes of materials designated for measurement loose in the vehicle are designated as
 "Loose Vehicle Measure" (LVM).
 Volumetric measurement of excavation, embankment, granular materials or similar
 materials in cubic yards will be made by the methods designated on the plans or in the
 proposal. For justifiable reasons, such as impracticability of measurement of volumes
 (usually small) by the designated method, the Engineer may order measurement by
 another method as follows:
 (a) Volumes designated for payment by FM may be measured LVM and converted
 to Contract measurement by multiplying the loose measure by 80 percent.
 (b) Volumes designated for payment by LVM may be measured in its original
 position by the average end area method and multiply the FM measure by 125
 percent.
 (c) Volumes designated for payment by FME may be measured in its original
 position by the average end area method and multiply the FM measure by 90
 percent.
 (d) Small volumes of surplus, excess excavation or other small volumes of
 excavation that are impractical to measure by the average end area method but
 are designated to be measured by FME may be measured LVM and multiply the
 loose measure by 72 percent.
 When the Engineer orders the use of a conversion factor for converting a unit of measure,
 the ordered method of measurement shall be deemed acceptable to all parties and shall be
 final.
 When the average end area method is indicated, other three-dimensional measurements of
 the prismoid occupied by the material in its natural position before removal or in its final
 position in the embankment may be used.
 When requested by the Contractor, material specified to be measured by the cubic yard or
 ton may be converted to the other measure as appropriate. Factors for this conversion
 will be determined by the District Materials Engineer and agreed to by the Contractor.
 The conversion of the materials along with the conversion factor will be incorporated into
 the Contract by Supplemental Agreement. The Supplemental Agreement must be
 executed before such method of measurement is used.
 All materials measured by the cubic yard LVM shall be hauled in approved vehicles and
 verified at the point of delivery. Vehicles may be of any size or type acceptable to the
 Engineer provided the body is of such shape that the capacity may be readily and
 accurately determined to the whole cubic yard in accordance with Department SOP.
 Unless all vehicles on the project are of uniform capacity, each vehicle must be plainly
 labeled to indicate its measured capacity. Where loose vehicle measurement (LVM) is
 used, the capacity will be computed to the nearest one-tenth cubic yard and paid to the
 whole cubic yard. Measurements greater than or equal to nine-tenths of a cubic yard will
 
 88
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 be rounded to the next highest number. Measurements less than nine-tenths of a cubic
 yard will not be rounded to the next highest number. Example: A vehicle measurement
 of 9.9 cubic yards will be classified as a 10-cubic yard vehicle. A vehicle measurement
 of 9.8 cubic yards will be classified as a 9-cubic yard vehicle. All vehicles shall be
 legibly numbered for identification.
 The vehicles shall be loaded to ensure a water level load when they arrive at the point of
 delivery. Loads hauled in unapproved vehicles and loads of a quantity less than the
 measured quantity for the hauling vehicle will be subject to rejection.
 Bituminous materials will be measured by the gallon or ton. Volumes will be measured
 at 60°F or corrected to the volume at 60°F using tables in Department SOP.
 109.02--Scope of Payment. The compensation, as herein provided, constitutes full
 payment to the Contractor for the complete work and for any and all claims of any type
 of the Contractor, including, but not limited to, (a) all materials, labor, tools, equipment
 and incidentals necessary for performing the work contemplated and embraced under the
 Contract; (b) all loss or damage of any kind arising out of the work; (c) all loss from any
 action of the elements, except as otherwise provided; (d) any unforeseen difficulties or
 obstruction of the work that may arise or be encountered during the prosecution of the
 work until its final acceptance by the Engineer; (e) all risks connected with the
 prosecution of the work; (f) all expenses incurred by or in consequence of suspension or
 discontinuance of the work; (g) any infringement of patents, trademarks or copyrights;
 and (h) completing the work in an acceptable manner according to the plans and
 specifications.
 If the "Basis of Payment" clause for a specific pay item requires that the contract unit
 price be considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the item, this
 same work or material will not also be measured or paid for under any other pay item that
 may appear elsewhere in the specifications.
 The payment of any current estimate, prior to final acceptance of the work by the
 Executive Director, shall in no way constitute an acknowledgment of the acceptance of
 the work, nor in any way affect the obligation of the Contractor to repair or renew
 defective parts of the work. The Engineer will be the judge of defects or imperfections,
 and the Contractor shall be liable to the Department for failure to correct same as
 provided herein.
 109.03--Compensation for Altered Quantities. Whenever the quantity of a pay item is
 increased or decreased from the original contract quantity, payment will be made on the
 basis of the actual quantity completed at the contract unit price or as modified by
 Supplemental Agreement.
 109.04--Extra Work. Extra work performed in accordance with the requirements and
 provisions of Subsection 104.03 will be paid for at the unit prices or lump sum price
 stipulated in a Supplemental Agreement or a Force Account Agreement authorizing the
 extra work. All extra work must be authorized prior to proceeding with the extra work,
 and every effort should be made to foresee the extra work before it becomes an
 emergency. The Department reserves the right to request a detailed cost breakdown on
 any request for extra work.
 
 89
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 109.04.1--Supplemental Agreement. When the Supplemental Agreement process is
 initiated, the Contractor will be required to submit to the Engineer a detailed breakdown
 for Material, Labor, Equipment, Profit and Overhead. The total allowable markup, which
 includes Contractor and Subcontractor work, if applicable, for Supplemental Agreement
 work shall not exceed 20%, which also includes tax and bond.
 The requirement for detailed cost breakdowns may be waived when a Department’s Bid
 Item History exists for the proposed item(s), and the Contractor’s requested price,
 including mark-up, is within 20% of the Department’s Bid History cost for that item(s).
 In any case, the Department reserves the right to request detailed cost breakdowns from
 the Contractor on any Supplemental Agreement request.
 109.04.2--Force Account Agreement. The Department may direct the Contractor to
 perform the extra work on a Force Account basis. Work done by Force Account will be
 handled in the following manner.
 The Contractor shall submit a plan of operation for how force account work will be
 performed including a work schedule, estimated size of the work crew, an equipment
 list, and anticipated materials. The Department will not allow the Contractor to
 perform force account work without this plan. The Department will make payments
 in the manner specified below, and this payment will be full compensation for the
 prosecution of the work performed on this basis.
 (a) Labor. For all authorized labor and foremen employed on the force account work,
 the Department will pay the actual rate of wage verified by certified payrolls. The
 wages shall be comparable to the wages paid by the Contractor for work of like
 nature for each hour that the said labor and foreman are actually engaged in such
 work, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing before the start of the force account
 work. Hourly wages for salaried employees will be based on a 40-hour work
 week.
 The Department will allow overtime work only if authorized by the Engineer prior
 to the start of the force account work.
 An amount will be added equal to twenty percent (20%) of the sum thereof
 (b) Bond, Insurance and Tax. The Department will pay the actual costs for property
 damage, liability and workers’ compensation insurance premiums, unemployment
 insurance contributions and social security taxes on the force account work. The
 Contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for such
 bond, insurance and tax costs.
 (c) Materials. For materials accepted by the Engineer and used in the specific force
 account work, the Department will pay for the actual cost of the materials,
 including taxes and transportation charges (exclusive of machinery rentals as
 hereinafter set forth).
 If materials used on force account work are taken from Contractor stock, then
 instead of invoices, the Contractor must furnish an affidavit certifying that the
 materials were taken from the Contractor’s stock, that the quantity claimed was
 actually used, and that the material and transportation costs claimed represent the
 
 90
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 actual costs to the Contractor. The Contractor’s authorized representative shall
 date and sign the statements.
 An amount will be added equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the sum thereof.
 (d) Equipment. Equipment used for force account work shall be of sufficient size
 and type necessary to perform the required work in an economic and expeditious
 manner. The Contractor must provide the manufacturer, make, model, year, type
 of fuel and other necessary information to determine proper hourly payment rates.
 Subject to advance approval of the Engineer, actual transportation cost for a
 distance of not more than 200 miles will be reimbursed for equipment not already
 on the project.
 For equipment authorized by the Engineer for use on the force account work, the
 Engineer will use the equipment rental rates from the “Rental Rate Blue Book” as
 published on the Equipment Watch website www.equipmentwatch.com for the
 time period the force account work is authorized to determine payment to the
 Contractor. The maximum allowable rates are determined as follows:
 1.
 
 2.
 
 3.
 
 4.
 5.
 
 The hourly equipment rate will equal the monthly rate shown divided by
 176. The hourly rate is then multiplied by adjustment factors for age and
 region. Do not use the weekly, daily, or hourly rates shown in the table.
 The hourly operating cost will be the estimated operating cost shown in the
 Rental Rate Blue Book table. The hourly estimated operating cost shall
 include all costs associated with routine maintenance and servicing,
 including but not limited to: fuel, lubrication, filters, blades, belts, pumps,
 lines, hoses, teeth, tires, tracks and all other incidentals necessary to operate
 and maintain the equipment. The Department will pay the estimated hourly
 rates for the actual time that the authorized equipment is in operation. Do
 not use the weekly, daily, or hourly rates shown in the table.
 The hourly working rate equals the adjusted hourly equipment rate plus the
 estimated hourly operating cost which is shown as the total under the
 FHWA Rate column.
 The idle or standby rate will equal the FHWA Rate minus the hourly
 Estimated Operating Costs times fifty percent (50%).
 These rates include the basic machine plus any necessary attachments.
 
 Idle or standby rates shall apply when equipment is not in operation and is
 approved by the Engineer to standby for later use to complete the work. In
 general, idle or standby rates shall apply when equipment is not in use, but will be
 needed again to complete the work and the cost of moving the equipment will
 exceed the accumulated standby cost. If the idle standby cost should exceed the
 equipment moving cost to or from the work site, the Contractor will be entitled to
 the moving cost only. Idle or standby rates will be used under the following
 conditions:
 1.
 2.
 
 The equipment is totally dedicated to the force account work and not used
 intermittently on other work.
 Idle or standby cost will be considered only after equipment has been operated
 on force account work.
 
 91
 
 Section 109
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Section 109
 
 Idle or standby cost will be not be paid for more than eight (8) hours in a day
 or 40 hours in a week.
 The sum of idle or standby time and operating time shall not exceed eight (8)
 hours per day.
 Idle or standby payment will not apply to days not normally considered to be
 work days such as holidays, weekends, or days of inclement weather when no
 other work is taking place.
 
 The Department will not pay for idle or standby time when equipment is
 inoperable, for time spent repairing equipment, or for the time elapsed after the
 Engineer has advised the Contractor that the equipment is no longer needed. The
 Department will determine if it will be more cost effective to pay idle time on
 approved equipment on site or for multiple mobilizations.
 If equipment is needed, which is not included in the Rental Rate Blue Book, the
 Department and Contractor will agree upon reasonable rental rates in writing
 before the equipment is used.
 All equipment shall be subject to approval from day to day in accordance with
 the requirements of Subsection 108.05.
 (e) Rented or Leased Equipment. The Department will pay for equipment that is
 rented or leased from a commercial rental company at actual invoice price,
 provided the prices are fair and reasonable but not to exceed the Rental Rate
 Blue Book’s monthly rates. The Contractor shall obtain competitive rates from
 multiple rental companies or equipment suppliers to determine the most cost
 effective rate offering the best value. The Department will determine if it will
 be more cost effective to leave the equipment on site and pay the invoice price, or
 pay for multiple mobilizations.
 An amount will be added equal to ten percent (10%) of the sum thereof for all
 costs associated with routine maintenance and servicing, including but not limited
 to: fuel, lubrication, filters, blades, belts, pumps, lines, hoses, teeth, tires, tracks
 and all other incidentals necessary to operate and maintain the equipment.
 (f) Daily Records. The Contractor and the Engineer, or their representatives, shall
 compare records at the end of each work day of the work performed and shall
 indicate agreement by signature on such form(s) provided by the Department
 (g) Statements. The Department will not make payment for work performed on a
 force account basis until the Contractor has furnished the Engineer with duplicate
 certified and itemized statements of the cost of force account work detailed as
 follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and extension for
 each laborer and foreman;
 Designation, dates, daily operating and standby hours, total hours, rental rate,
 and extension for each unit of machinery and equipment;
 Quantities of materials, prices, and extensions;
 Transportation of equipment and materials; and

 Section 109
 
 Cost of property damage, liability and workers’ compensation insurance
 premiums, unemployment insurance contributions and social security tax.
 
 The Contractor shall provide support for all statements with receipted invoices for
 all materials used, including transportation charges. The Contractor’s authorized
 representative shall date and sign the statements
 (h) Miscellaneous. The Department will allow lodging costs only if authorized by the
 Engineer prior to starting the force account work. Lodging costs must be verified
 by paid receipts. Costs will not be allowed for meals or travel to and from the
 jobsite
 No allowance will be made for general superintendence, the use of small tools, or
 any other costs for which no specific allowance is herein provided.
 109.05--Eliminated Items. Any item found unnecessary for the proper completion of
 the work may, upon written order of the Engineer, be eliminated from the Contract.
 When the Contractor is notified of the elimination of an item, the Contractor will be
 reimbursed for the actual work and actual costs of materials, which may include delivery
 and handling costs, prior to the notification as provided in Subsection 104.02.
 109.06--Partial Payments.
 109.06.1--General. Monthly estimates will be authorized by the Engineer provided the
 amount due on completed work is no less than $1,000.00 including advancement on
 materials. The estimate will be prepared by the Engineer on the day of the month
 prescribed by the Commission. Partial payment based on estimated quantities and
 computed at contract unit price will be made on or about the day prescribed by the
 Commission.
 If defective work and/or materials are discovered or reasonable doubt arises as to the
 integrity of any part of the work for which partial payment has been allowed, a deduction
 from subsequent estimates in an amount equal to the value of the defective or questioned
 work will be made until the defects have been remedied or the causes for doubt removed.
 Each month the Contractor receives a monthly progress estimate, the Contractor shall
 review the Engineer's progress estimate as to the accuracy of the quantities. Should the
 Engineer's estimated quantity for any pay item be greater than a tolerance of plus or
 minus ten percent (±10%) of the Contractor's estimated quantity, the Contractor shall
 confer with the Resident or Project Engineer to rectify any differences. Each should
 make a record of the differences, if any, and conclusions reached. In the event mutual
 agreement cannot be reached, the Contractor will be allowed a maximum of 30 calendar
 days following the Contractor’s receipt of the monthly estimate in question to submit in
 writing a Notice of Claim in accordance with the provisions Subsection 104.02.4.
 Otherwise, the Engineer's estimated quantities shall be considered acceptable pending
 any changes made during the checking of final quantities.
 109.06.2--Advancement on Materials. Advance payment may be received for major,
 nonperishable or durable materials that will be incorporated permanently into the project,
 such as base aggregates, reinforcing steel, bridge piling, structural steel, prefabricated
 bridge components, traffic signal equipment, electrical equipment, fencing materials, and
 
 93
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 sign materials with the approval of the Engineer. Advance payment may be requested for
 structural steel members provided that fabrication has been completed and the members
 have been declared satisfactory for storage by a Department representative. The
 Contractor must make a written request to the Project Engineer for advanced payment
 and furnish written consent of the Surety. To qualify for advance payment, materials
 must be stored or stockpiled as follows: (a) on or near the project or at other locations
 approved by the Engineer; (b) in the case of precast concrete members, treated timber,
 guard posts and other approved preprocessed durable and bulky materials, the materials
 may be stored at the commercial producer's yard provided it is located in Mississippi; (c)
 in the case of prestressed concrete members that may require being produced at an out-ofstate location, the prestress members shall be produced and may be stored at the
 commercial manufacturer’s yard provided it is a PCI certified plant on the Department’s
 List of Approved Prestress & Precast Plants and located within the continental United
 States; or (d) in the case of structural steel members that may require fabrication at an
 out-of-state location, the fabricated members may be stored at the location of the
 commercial fabricator's yard provided it is located within the continental United States.
 Advancements will not be allowed until the Project Engineer has received copies of
 material invoices and certified test reports or acceptable certificates of conformance, and
 in the case of materials stored at the commercial producer's/fabricator's yard, the material
 shall be positively identified for the specific project and a Certificate of Storage issued by
 the Department or a designated representative of the Department. Requests for
 advancements on fabricated structural steel members and prestress concrete members
 stored out-of-state will be denied when the Department does not have available a
 designated representative to issue a Certificate of Storage.
 The Contractor shall make suitable arrangements to the satisfaction of the Engineer for
 storage and protection at approved sites or, in the case of materials stored at the
 commercial producer's yard located in Mississippi or, in the case of fabricated structural
 steel members stored at the commercial fabricator's yard or prestress concrete members
 stored at a commercial manufacturer’s yard located within the continental United States,
 the Contractor shall make arrangements with the producer/fabricator for suitable storage
 and protection. If advance payment is allowed and the materials are damaged, lost,
 destroyed or for any reason become unacceptable, the previous payments will be
 deducted from subsequent estimates until the materials are replaced or restored to an
 acceptable condition. In all cases, the Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the
 Commission and Department in the event of loss or damage, regardless of cause.
 An invoice or an accumulation of invoices for each eligible material must total $10,000
 or more before consideration will be given for advanced payment. When allowed,
 advance payment will be based on verified actual material cost plus transportation
 charges to the point of storage. Sales tax, local haul and handling costs shall not be
 included as material cost.
 Advance payment shall not exceed 100% of the invoice price or 75% of the total contract
 bid price for the pay item, whichever is less.
 Advance payment for a component of a pay item shall not exceed 95% of the invoice
 price or 75% of the total contract bid price for the pay item of which the material is a
 part, whichever is less.
 
 94
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 No advance payment will be made on minor material items, hardware, etc.
 No advance payment will be made for materials when it is anticipated that those materials
 will be incorporated into the project within 60 calendar days.
 Advance payment will be paid for those materials that are not readily available, and that
 can be easily identified and secured for a specific project and for which lengthy
 stockpiling periods would not be detrimental.
 Where a storage area is used for more than one project, material for each project shall be
 segregated from material for other projects, identified, and secured. Adequate access for
 auditing shall be provided. All units shall be stored in a manner so that they are clearly
 visible for counting and/or inspection of the individual units.
 Unless specifically provided for in the Contract, advance payment will not be made on
 materials stored or stockpiled outside of the State of Mississippi, except for fabricated
 structural steel members or prestress concrete members.
 Materials for which an advanced payment has been allowed must be paid for by the
 Contractor within 60 days of the estimate on which the advanced payment was first
 allowed and proof of said payment must be verified by the supplier. If proof of payment
 is not furnished within the allowable 60 days, the advanced payment will be deducted on
 subsequent current estimates until such time that proof of payment is furnished.
 As the materials are incorporated into the work, proportionate reductions for advance
 payments shall be made from monthly estimates covering the work performed.
 Calculation of percentage of completion, or rate of progress, shall be based on completed
 work and no consideration will be given to stockpiled materials.
 109.06.3--Retainage. Regardless of the value of the earned work based on the value of
 work scheduled for completion by the approved progress schedule, no deduction for
 retainage will be made from payments and advancement of materials due to the
 Contractor. Likewise, the Contractor shall not withhold any retainage from any payments
 due to a Subcontractor or Supplier.
 109.06.4--Withholding of Estimates. An estimate may be withheld indefinitely until all
 directives of the Engineer, given in compliance with and by virtue of the terms of the
 Contract, have been complied with by the Contractor.
 109.07--Changes in Material Costs. Because of the uncertainty in estimating the costs
 of petroleum products that will be required during the life of a Contract, an adjustment in
 compensation for certain materials may be allowed if indicated on the bid sheets. If an
 adjustment is allowed, an adjustment will be provided as follows:
 Bituminous Products -- Each month the Department will acquire unit prices from
 producers or suppliers who supply the State highway construction industry with
 bituminous products. The average of all quotes for each product will serve as the base
 price for Contracts let in the subsequent month.
 Fuels -- Selected cash price quotations for bulk gasoline and diesel fuel will be obtained
 by the Department. The appropriate adjustment per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel
 
 95
 
 Section 109
 
 Section 109
 
 will be added to allow for taxes and markups. The prices thus determined will serve as
 the base prices for Contracts let in the subsequent month.
 Monthly petroleum products base prices will be available on the Department’s web site.
 Current monthly prices will be posted to this web site on or before the 15th of each month.
 The Contractor should use these petroleum base prices when preparing their bids. The
 current monthly petroleum products base prices will be acknowledged by the Contractor
 and become part of the Contract during the execution process.
 Monthly Petroleum Products Base Prices can be viewed at:
 http://sp.gomdot.com/Contract%20Administration/BidSystems/Pages/letting%20calendar
 .aspx
 Each month thereafter the Engineer will be furnished with the current monthly prices.
 Adjustments for change in cost will be determined from the difference in the Contract
 base prices and the prices for the period that the work is performed and for the quantities
 completed. Adjustments may increase or decrease compensation depending on the
 difference between the base prices and prices for the estimate period.
 The adjustments will be determined for the quantities of bituminous products and the
 average fuel requirements for processing a unit of work as set forth herein.

 contract time as defined in Subsection 101.02 herein, and as determined by checked final
 quantities.
 109.08--Contract Overpayment(s). The Contractor is duly responsible to and will
 immediately reimburse the Commission, without any demand therefore, for any
 overpayment(s) of which it has knowledge, or through due diligence, should have
 knowledge.
 If notice is given to the Contractor of any overpayment, and the Contractor fails to make
 payment within 60 days of the notice, then the Commission may offset and withhold a
 sum equal to any overpayment(s), plus interest at one percent (1%) per month from the
 date of notice until paid, against any sums due the Contractor under the terms of this
 Contract or any other active Contract(s), or any Contract subsequently executed.
 109.09--Freight Rates and Labor Rates. No allowance or deduction will be made for
 increases or decreases in freight rates or demurrage or for any increase or decrease in
 labor rates unless so stipulated in the Contract.
 109.10--Blank.
 109.11--Acceptance and Final Payment. When the work has been accepted by the
 Executive Director, a final estimate showing the value of the work will be prepared by
 the Engineer as soon as the necessary final measurements and computations can be made.
 The amount of this estimate, less all previous payments and deductions required under
 the Contract, will be paid to the Contractor as soon as practicable. Final payment will not
 be made until written consent of the Contractor and the Surety has been delivered to the
 Contract Administration Engineer of the Department. It shall be the Contractor's
 responsibility to have the Surety provide the consent. Delays in final payment because of
 non-receipt of Surety's consent shall not be cause for the payment of interest under the
 provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §31-5-27, for the period of time occasioned by such delay.
 Acceptance by the Contractor of final payment shall operate as and shall be a release the
 Commission from all claims or liability under the Contract and any act or neglect of the
 Commission relating to or connected with the Contract.
 However, nothing herein shall release the Contractor from liability for any latent defects
 subsequently discovered. In addition, the Contractor shall warrant the Work from any
 defects in Materials or workmanship for a period of one (1) year from final acceptance.
 109.12--Right to Audit. The Department reserves the right to audit the Contractor's
 records at any time during the Contract period, during any claim process, up to three
 years after the final Contract payment or up to three years after any litigation or
 arbitration is filed, whichever is later. If the Department commences an audit, the
 Contractor will be required to provide sufficient original documents and records to satisfy
 the Department's Audit Division or other appropriate individual, including any outside
 consultants retained by the Department, that the costs included in the Contractor's claim
 were incurred and are appropriate for payment under the terms of the Contract and solely
 in performance of the project and work phase and were not incurred on any other work
 phase of the project. The Department's audit will be conducted in accordance with
 United States General Accounting Office's Governmental Auditing Standards, the
 Institute of Internal Auditor's Professional Practice Standards, and the American Institute

 201.03--Construction Requirements.
 201.03.1--Clearing and Grubbing.
 201.03.1.1--General. The Engineer will establish rights-of-way, easements, construction
 lines and designate all trees, shrubs, plants and items to remain.
 It is the intent of these specifications that desirable natural growth within the rights-ofway and easements be preserved where practicable. Undesirable growth and other things
 that detract from the aesthetic value of the completed work or interfere with construction
 or future maintenance shall be removed. In areas where desirable natural growth is
 designated to remain, the Contractor shall thin or trim shrubbery and live trees to the
 extent consistent with the intent of these specifications. Use of methods or equipment
 that might mar or destroy vegetation designated to remain will not be permitted.
 It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to consider all rights-of-way agreements
 with the property owners regarding merchantable timber prior to submitting a bid.
 Merchantable timber conveyed to the State and required to be removed will become the
 property of the Contractor unless specifically designated otherwise in the contract
 documents.
 All clearing and grubbing necessary for setting construction stakes shall be completed a
 satisfactory distance ahead of the grading operations.
 201.03.1.2--Clearing and Grubbing. Surface objects, trees, stumps, roots and other
 protruding or underground obstructions, not designated to remain, shall be cleared and
 grubbed, including mowing, as required. Undisturbed stumps shall be cut off no more
 than six inches above the ground line or water level. Undisturbed stumps and nonperishable solid objects that are a minimum of three feet below subgrade or slope of
 embankment may be left in place when authorized by the Engineer. Stumps and nonperishable solid objects in swampy or wooded areas where mowing is not anticipated
 
 101
 
 Section 201
 
 Section 201
 
 may be authorized to remain, provided they do not extend more than six inches above the
 ground line or low water level.
 The Engineer may also permit sound stumps to remain outside the construction limits
 where mowing is anticipated provided they are cut off flush with or below the surface of
 the final ground line.
 Except in areas to be excavated, stump holes and other holes from which obstructions are
 removed shall be backfilled with suitable material and compacted to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer.
 All operations shall be conducted in such a manner as to prevent damage to adjacent

 surfaces of trees and shrubs.
 201.03.1.3--Clearing and Grubbing of Bridge Sites. When separate and concurrent
 grading and bridge contracts are to be in progress between the termini of construction,
 clearing and grubbing of the bridge site shall be the responsibility of the grading
 Contractor, unless the bridge contract contains a bid item for clearing and grubbing.
 When there is not a coincidental grading contract or a bid item for clearing and grubbing
 in the bridge contract, clearing and grubbing of the bridge sites shall be considered
 incidental to and included in the price bid for the bridge items.
 201.03.2--Random Clearing and Grubbing, and Random Clearing. This work
 consists of random clearing and grubbing areas designated on the plans or in the contract
 documents. Random clearing and grubbing will be performed in the designated areas in
 accordance with the requirements of Subsection 201.03.1.
 Random clearing will consist of removing all things such as trees and scrubs within areas
 shown on the plans or in the contract documents where grubbing is not needed.
 Examples of such areas may be limits of fencing, site flares, safety zones, etc.
 When random clearing is required in areas such as safety/clear zones, cutting shall be
 approximately flush with the ground. Grubbing will not be permitted in these areas.
 Stumps are to be cut approximately flush with the ground, but in no case shall stumps
 extend more than two inches above the ground line. This work also includes the removal
 and proper disposal of the cut material off of the right-of-way, or it may be chipped or
 
 102
 
 Section 201
 
 Section 201
 
 shredded by mechanical means and mulched on the right-of-way to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. Material and debris that is removed from the right-of-way shall be disposed of
 outside of limits of view from any public road, street, park or other such public facility at
 locations obtained by the Contractor in accordance with Subsection 104.05 and Section
 202.

 SECTION 203 - EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 203.01--Description. This work consists of excavation and embankment required for
 roadways, ditches, channel changes and borrow material, preparation of subgrades and
 foundations, construction of embankments and other utilization or disposal of materials
 excavated, and the compaction and dressing of excavated areas and embankments. This
 work shall also consist of any required site grading in accordance with the details in the
 plans and/or as directed by the Engineer. The work of excavation for structures is
 covered separately under Section 206 and not included under this section.
 203.01.1--Unclassified Excavation.
 Unclassified excavation will consist of all
 excavation materials of whatever character encountered in the work except for those
 classes of excavation for which separate pay items are provided.
 203.01.2--Rock Excavation. When shown as a pay item, rock excavation will consist of
 material that cannot be excavated without blasting and shall also include large boulders
 and detached stones having volumes of one-half cubic yard or more. The use of the
 words "rock," "boulders," "stone," or synonyms of these words appearing elsewhere on
 the plans, soil profile or these specifications does not imply that these materials may be
 included under this classification unless so indicated in the contract proposal.
 The Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer when rock excavation is
 encountered during the progress of the work so the necessary measurements may be
 made for determining the volume removed.
 
 106
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 203.01.3--Muck Excavation. Muck excavation will consist of the excavation, removal
 and disposal of natural deposits of soils and organic matter in accordance with the
 provisions of Subsection 203.03.7. Muck excavation shall not be identified by visual
 means but will be sampled and tested, at a frequency determined by the Engineer, to
 verify its classification. Muck excavation is defined as a saturated soil having an organic
 content of at least six percent (6%) as determined by Mississippi Test Method MT-29, or
 AASHTO T 267.
 It is the intent that all areas of muck excavation will be located and defined during the
 design phase of a project. However, if additional areas of questionable material are found
 during construction, the material shall be tested to see if it is a saturated soil having an
 organic content of six percent (6%) or more before it is considered muck. If the material
 is defined as a muck, based on testing, the method of removal should not be an issue and
 the material should be paid for as 203-D, Muck Excavation.
 Excavated material not meeting the herein established requirements for classification as
 muck excavation shall be used, measured and paid for under the pay item in which the
 material is being used.
 In extreme cases, in non-organic areas where all efforts to drain the area and/or dry the
 material have proved unsuccessful, the Project Engineer, in consultation with the District
 Materials Engineer and District Construction Engineer, shall make the determination as
 to whether the material will be classified as muck excavation or unclassified excavation.
 Removal of muck excavation shall be in accordance with the requirements of Subsection
 104.05.
 203.01.4--Borrow Excavation. Borrow excavation will consist of approved material
 required for the construction of embankments or other portions of the work and shall be
 obtained from approved sources outside the right-of-way except as provided in
 Subsection 203.03.3. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor shall
 make arrangements for obtaining borrow and pay all costs involved. Contractorfurnished borrow shall meet the requirements of Subsections 106.02.2 and 703.21.
 203.01.5--Channel Excavation. When shown as a pay item, channel excavation will
 consist of excavation and disposal of all material from widening, deepening or
 straightening of an existing channel, or construction of a new channel. The Contractor
 shall furnish a disposal area unless otherwise provided in the contract. Material
 designated as channel excavation and used in the roadbed or other required embankment
 construction will be measured for payment as channel excavation only.
 203.01.6--Excess Excavation. When shown as a pay item, excess excavation will
 consist of excavation that cannot be satisfactorily used or disposed of within the right-ofway. Exclusive of muck excavation, excess excavation may include any type, kind, or
 class of excavation that the Engineer determines must be removed from the right-of-way.
 It will not include any excess caused by the Contractor importing too much excavation
 from sources outside the roadway structure; in such case, the excess excavation shall be
 removed from the right-of-way without cost to the State.
 Unless otherwise indicated in the contract, the Contractor shall provide a disposal area for
 
 107
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 excess excavation.
 Removal of excess excavation shall be in accordance with the requirements of Subsection
 104.05.
 203.01.7--Surplus Excavation. When shown as a pay item, surplus excavation will
 consist of excavation within the right-of-way that is in excess or unsuitable for
 embankments but can be satisfactorily used or disposed of within the right-of-way.
 203.02--Blank.
 203.03--Construction Requirements.
 203.03.1--General. Excavation and embankment operations may be started at the
 location and in the sequence approved by the Engineer when:
 (a)
 (b)
 (c)
 (d)
 (e)
 
 sufficient clearing and grubbing has been completed and accepted;
 the work has been cross sectioned and slope staked;
 installation of required pipes, culverts, and approved backfills are complete;
 the site has been prepared in accordance with these specifications; and
 the Contractor is aware of proper methods of haul and disposal of material.
 
 Excavations and embankments shall be finished to reasonably smooth and uniform
 surfaces. No material shall be wasted without permission of the Engineer. Excavation
 operations shall be conducted in a manner that material outside the construction limits
 will not be unnecessarily disturbed. No excavation or embankment shall be placed while
 frozen or placed on frozen materials.
 Where plating with topsoil is contemplated, either in cut or fill sections, appropriate
 adjustment shall be made in the graded section during construction so that the finished
 section after plating will conform to the typical sections shown on the plans.
 Unless otherwise specified, rock larger than three inches shall be removed from the
 roadbed to a minimum depth of eight inches below subgrade and backfilled with material
 designated on the plans or approved by the Engineer. Care shall be taken that undrained
 pockets are not left in the surface of rock. Rock removed more than 12 inches below
 subgrade will not be measured for payment and backfilling in excess of 12 inches will be
 at the expense of the Contractor. Removal of boulders and subsequent backfilling are
 excluded from the 12-inch limitation.
 Borrow material should not be placed until excavation from the roadway has been
 utilized as shown on the plans. Excess material determined to have been caused by the
 Contractor importing too much excavation from sources outside the roadway shall be
 removed from the right-of-way in accordance with Subsection 104.05 unless permission
 is given by the Engineer that the material may be disposed of within the right-of-way. In
 either case, the volume of excess material will be measured by the method deemed most
 appropriate by the Engineer under the provisions of Subsection 109.01 and deducted
 from measured quantities. The Contractor shall not excavate beyond the dimensions and
 elevations established or approved, and no material shall be moved prior to the staking
 out and cross-sectioning of the site.
 
 108
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 If borrow material is to be measured for payment in its original position (FM), the
 finished borrow areas shall be left in a condition suitable to accurately measure the
 material used.
 Additional requirements shall be those applicable conditions governing the use of local
 materials as set out in Section 106.
 Obliteration of old roadways shall include all operations necessary to incorporate the old
 roadway into the new roadway or into the surrounding right-of-way in a way that will
 provide a pleasing appearance from the new roadway. Unless other pay items are
 provided, roadway obliteration will be paid for as unclassified excavation.
 When excavating operations encounter the remains of prehistoric dwelling sites or other
 artifacts of historical or archeological significance, the operations shall be temporarily
 discontinued. The Engineer will contact appropriate authorities to determine their
 significance and appropriate disposition. When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor
 shall excavate the site in a manner to preserve the artifacts encountered, or aid in the
 determination of significance and disposition, and when ordered, shall remove them for
 delivery to the custody of the proper State authorities. Such excavation and removal will
 be considered and paid for as Extra Work.
 If excavation to grade results in a foundation, subgrade, or slope of unsuitable soil, the
 Engineer may require the Contractor to remove unsuitable materials and backfill to the
 required grade with approved material. Slides or other soil failures shall be removed by
 the Contractor unless their removal is waived by the Engineer. The Contractor shall
 conduct operations in such a way that the Engineer can take the necessary cross sections
 before backfill is placed.
 The Engineer may designate as unsuitable those soils that, at the proper moisture content,
 cannot be processed to the required density and stability. All unsuitable material shall be
 disposed of as specified or directed.
 When the Engineer orders or the contract requires excavation to be handled more than
 one time prior to final placement, such as topsoil to be stockpiled and reserved for later
 use, payment will be made at the contract unit price for the class excavation involved for
 each handling approved by the Engineer, or it will be paid as another item of work for the
 final handling when so specified. The topsoil shall be dressed vertically with a dozer or
 other tracked equipment.
 203.03.2--Topsoil. Where the salvaging and stockpiling of topsoil is specified, this
 operation shall be completed before beginning excavation of the underlying material.
 203.03.3--Borrow Excavation from Within the Right-of-Way. When the contract
 indicates borrow excavation to be paid for as final measure-embankment (FME), the
 plans may also identify certain estimated excavation volumes by the symbol ESFE
 (Estimated State Furnished Excavation). Suitable quantities of ESFE may be used by the
 Contractor without charge in the construction of embankments to be measured FME.
 Quantities of ESFE shown on the plans are for the Contractor's information only and may
 vary or may be varied by the Engineer. The change in quantity shall not be cause for
 additional compensation.
 
 109
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 Excavation designated as ESFE is required to be performed and will not be measured in
 its original position. ESFE suitable for use in embankment or other features of the work
 shall be used and will be included in measured quantities of borrow excavation (FME).
 Any materials indicated as ESFE that are found to be unsuitable shall be removed and
 disposed of as provided elsewhere in the contract.
 203.03.4--Construction of Bridge Approaches. The construction of "spill through"
 embankments and approaches shall be the responsibility of the grading Contractor. The
 existence of a separate contract awarded for bridge construction will not alter this
 responsibility.
 The grading Contractor shall construct the bridge approaches to subgrade elevation and
 extending a minimum of 100 feet from each bridge end as soon as practicable. All bridge
 end slopes shall be finished to the lines and grades specified except the allowable
 tolerance for initial construction of bridge end slopes to be paved is plus six inches.
 The bridge Contractor shall drive the piling through the fill, complete the end bents, end
 spans, and slope paving as soon as practicable after the bridge end fills have been placed
 in order that the grading may be completed by the grading Contractor. The bridge
 Contractor is responsible for the final shaping of the "spillthrough" embankment for
 placement of slope paving or riprap.
 203.03.5--Excavation Operations. Excavation operations shall be so conducted as to
 minimize the loosening of materials outside the required slopes or below the indicated
 grade. No payment will be made for the removal, disposal or replacement of material
 determined to be loosened or undercut through carelessness or negligence on the part of
 the Contractor. Neither will payment be made for excavation that is used for purposes
 other than designated except as provided in Subsection 104.06.
 When practicable, excavation and disposal of the material shall be conducted in such a
 manner that the most suitable material will be placed in the top courses of embankments.
 Also, adequate drainage that will conform to the finished drainage system shall be
 maintained.
 All earth cut slopes shall be dressed to smooth and uniform surfaces to conform to the
 specified sections. The allowable horizontal tolerance at subgrade elevation will be fivetenths of a foot. The allowable tolerance from staked cut slopes will be plus or minus
 five tenths of a foot horizontally for each 10 feet of depth. Allowable vertical tolerances
 at subgrade elevation shall be in accordance with the tolerances set out in Section 321.
 Care shall be taken to avoid overshooting of material when blasting. All rock cut slopes
 shall be left with a reasonably uniform surface, and all loose, shattered or overhanging
 rock shall be removed.
 203.03.6--Muck Excavation. The depth and width of muck excavation will normally be
 shown on the plans. The excavation and subsequent basement soil formation shall be
 completed as soon as practicable in order to obtain maximum consolidation prior to final
 shaping of the subgrade and subsequent construction of the pavement structure. When
 directed by the Engineer, other unsatisfactory foundation material beneath or
 immediately adjacent to the muck shall be removed and disposed of as muck excavation.
 
 110
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 Excavation of muck shall proceed ahead of backfilling or embankment operations for the
 full width and depth shown on the plans or as directed.
 Placing of embankment material in the excavated area by backdumping may be permitted
 when the Engineer determines this method of placement to be satisfactory. In this case,
 placement shall immediately follow the muck removal, and where deemed desirable, the
 fill shall be constructed forward in a wedge shape with as much of a surcharge above
 grade as practicable to afford maximum displacement of the remaining muck. Pressure
 developed on the advancing toe of the embankment by the displaced muck shall be
 relieved by excavating and removing the muck. Otherwise, embankment construction
 shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 203.03.8.
 The Contractor shall take necessary precautions to ensure that stream channels and
 drainage ditches will not be filled by movement of muck. Displaced materials adjacent to
 the roadway shall be leveled or disposed of as specified. In any case, the material shall
 be left in such a manner that it will not present an unsatisfactory appearance, interfere
 with essential drainage or prevent proper embankment formation.
 203.03.7--Disposal of Unsuitable, Surplus, Channel and Excess Excavation. All
 material encountered in excavation within the right-of-way that is unsuitable for use in
 the work shall be removed and disposed of as specified in the contract or as directed.
 Unsuitable material shall be understood to be any material that, at the proper moisture
 content, cannot be processed to the required density and stability.
 The Contractor will be paid for unsuitable material ordered excavated and disposed of
 and the required backfill material at the respective contract prices except when the
 unsuitable material was placed under the contract.
 Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall provide at no additional costs to the State
 the location for the disposal of muck and excess excavation and shall furnish the
 Engineer with two signed copies of the release as provided in Subsection 104.05.
 Removal of muck and excess excavation shall be in accordance with the requirements of
 Subsection 104.05.
 Surplus excavation as defined in Subsection 203.01.7 shall be used for widening of
 embankments, flattening slopes or at other locations within the right-of-way for the
 purpose indicated. If there is more surplus excavation than can be effectively used within
 the right-of-way, the Engineer may reclassify the excavation as excess excavation as
 defined in Subsection 203.01.6 when the contract contains a bid item for excess
 excavation or order its disposal as extra work.
 Unless specified for use in embankments, channel excavation may be used to fill old
 channels when so designated on the plans and to fill washes and gullies or wasted as
 directed by the Engineer. It shall be spread and leveled or otherwise shaped to blend with
 the adjacent terrain and shall not obstruct drainage, interfere with the property rights of
 others or present an unsatisfactory appearance.
 203.03.8--Embankment Construction.
 203.03.8.1--General. Embankment construction shall consist of constructing roadway
 
 111
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 embankments, dikes, placing and compacting of approved material where unsuitable
 material has been removed, backfilling of structures where not otherwise provided for
 and placing and compacting embankment material in holes, pits or other depressions.
 This work shall also consist of preparation of the areas upon which embankments are to
 be constructed. Only approved materials shall be placed in embankments and backfills.
 Unsuitable or perishable materials such as rubbish, sod, brush, roots, logs, stumps after
 removal, heavy vegetation, sawdust, etc., shall not be incorporated in embankments.
 Rocks, broken concrete, or other solid material shall not be placed in embankment areas
 where piles are to be driven.
 Special materials for inundated areas, filter beds, etc., or special backfill may be specified
 elsewhere in the contract.
 203.03.8.2--Preparation of Embankment Areas. Preparation of embankment areas
 shall be in accordance with one or a combination of the following procedures:
 (a) All grade points shall be undercut and backfilled with suitable material as
 directed by the Engineer and compacted to the density for the design soil portion
 of embankments. The material excavated from the undercut, if suitable, shall be
 used in other portions of the work. The undercut at each grade point shall be
 approximately three feet below subgrade. The undercut shall be extended a
 sufficient distance into the cut to provide an undercut grade at the point of
 intersection with the subgrade of not less than three feet below natural ground.
 Approved undercut will be measured for payment as excavation.
 (b) Where an old road surface containing granular materials or surface treatment is
 less than three feet below subgrade, the old road shall be scarified as directed.
 The scarified material shall be compacted to the density specified for the design
 soil portion of the embankment prior to placing additional material.
 (c) Unless otherwise specified or directed by the Engineer, all sod, vegetation and
 unsuitable soil shall be removed from the surface upon which the embankment
 is to be constructed when the height of the embankment to subgrade will be
 three feet or less. The cleared surface shall be thoroughly mixed by plowing,
 scarifying or disk-harrowing to a depth of at least six inches. The area shall then
 be compacted to the density specified for the design soil portion of the
 embankment.
 The removed vegetation and unsuitable soil shall be disposed of as directed. No
 measurement for payment will be made unless the Engineer requires that the
 material be loaded and hauled for use or disposal in another area. In this case,
 measurement for payment will be made as provided in Subsection 203.04 and
 haul will be paid as provided in Section 205. No direct payment will be made for
 the plowing, scarifying or disk-harrowing.
 (d) In areas where the height of embankment to subgrade is to be greater than three
 feet, all material determined by the Engineer to be unsuitable as a foundation of
 the embankment shall be undercut and disposed of as directed. All sod on other
 areas shall be thoroughly disk-harrowed before construction of the embankment.
 Approved undercut will be measured for payment as excavation and haul will be
 paid as provided for in Section 205. No direct payment will be made for the
 
 112
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 disk-harrowing.
 (e) Where embankment is to be constructed against existing roadway slopes or on
 hillsides, the slopes that are steeper than 6:1 shall be continuously benched as
 the new work is constructed on the slope. Benching shall be of sufficient depth
 and width to permit operation of the construction equipment. Each horizontal
 cut shall begin at the intersection of the original ground or slope and the vertical
 side of the previous cut. Suitable material thus cut out shall be re-compacted
 along with the new embankment material and will not be measured for payment.
 203.03.8.3--Embankment Formation. After the area has been prepared as specified, the
 embankment shall be constructed in full-width layers parallel to the finished grade.
 Except as herein provided, the non-compacted thickness of each layer shall not exceed
 eight inches and shall be spread, shaped and compacted to the required density and
 stability. The completed embankment shall conform to the line, grade, and cross-section.
 The required stability in embankment construction shall be that which the Engineer
 determines can be reasonably obtained at the proper moisture content for the material
 being placed. Sponginess, shoving or other displacement under heavy equipment will be
 considered prima facie evidence of the lack of stability.
 Direct casting or similar methods will not be permitted unless authorized in writing by
 the Engineer. When direct casting is authorized, all material shall be moved from the
 point where it is deposited, spread and compacted in uniform layers as specified herein.
 203.03.8.4--Basement Soils. Reference is made to Figure 1 at the end of Subsection 101
 regarding basement soils. In low, swampy ground that will not support the weight of
 hauling equipment, the Engineer may permit the bottom portion of the embankment to be
 built in a uniformly distributed layer of sufficient thickness to support the construction
 equipment. However, this method will not be permitted in any portion of the
 embankment within three feet of the subgrade.
 Where the embankment material is from an inconsistent soil deposit, construction shall
 be performed so as to eliminate pockets or strata of varying materials. Each layer shall
 be disk-harrowed and heavily bladed for its full depth; or moved from its position of
 deposit by appropriate equipment; or processed by other means to the extent necessary to
 eliminate pockets or stratification of the embankment materials. The layer shall then be
 shaped and compacted in accordance with these specifications.
 Rock shall be distributed over the embankment area to avoid bridging, nests or pockets,
 and all voids shall be completely filled with earth or stone fragments and compacted.
 Where only occasional boulders are encountered, they shall be placed near the outer
 slopes in lower portions of the embankment.
 Where the excavated material consists predominately of rock fragments of sizes that
 cannot be placed in layers of the thickness specified without crushing, pulverizing or
 further breaking down of pieces resulting from excavation methods, the material may be
 placed in layers not exceeding the thickness of the approximate average size of the rocks,
 but in no case to exceed three feet. The balance of the embankment shall be composed of
 suitable material placed in layers not exceeding eight inches in loose thickness and
 
 113
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 compacted as specified.
 203.03.8.5--Design Soils. Reference is made to Figure 1 at the end of Subsection 101
 regarding design soils. Each layer of the design soil shall be disk-harrowed and heavily
 bladed for its full depth, or processed by other approved means to the extent necessary to
 provide a layer of material reasonably uniform in character. Each layer shall then be
 shaped and compacted in accordance with these specifications.
 203.03.8.6--Backfill and Embankment Formation Adjacent to Structures.
 Backfilling around structures shall not start until permission has been granted by the
 Engineer as referenced in Subsection 601.03.6.3. After approval is given to proceed, the
 work shall be performed under the supervision of the Engineer or the Engineer’s
 designated representative.
 Material used shall be suitable material obtained from structure excavation, roadway and
 drainage excavation or other designated material. The material shall be approved before
 placement and shall be the best available from the source. It shall preferably be sandy or
 loamy non-plastic material and free from large lumps, clods, rock or other objectionable
 matter. Adequate provision shall be made for thorough drainage of all backfilling.
 The backfill material shall be deposited in uniform and parallel layers not to exceed eight
 inches of loose material on each side of box bridges, culverts or other structures. Each
 layer shall be processed by approved methods for its full depth and to the extent
 necessary to provide a layer of material reasonably uniform in character and shall be so
 placed and compacted that drainage of the layer will be away from both the longitudinal
 and the transverse axes of the structure. In addition, the backfill for abutments, retaining
 walls, wing walls or other structures or sections thereof shall be built in layers with each
 layer being constructed for the full length of the unit and special precaution shall be taken
 to prevent any wedging action against the structure.
 The material for each layer shall be uniformly compacted with approved mechanical
 equipment or self-powered mechanical tampers to not less than the density required in the
 adjacent embankment. The work shall be conducted so as to form a berm of compacted
 soil of sufficient width on each side of the structure. The berm at the top of the structure
 shall be at least six feet in width. The slopes of the backfill shall not be steeper than 2:1
 at any point. Unless otherwise specified, backfilling shall continue as applicable to the
 level of the original ground or to an elevation at least one foot above the top of the
 structure or to the top of the graded section when less than one foot of cover is provided.
 The work shall be conducted in a manner that the Engineer can make the necessary tests
 for compaction as the work progresses.
 The Contractor shall repair, restore with new work or make good without extra
 compensation all damage to the structure as a result of the backfilling operation.
 Payment for this construction shall be included in the contract unit price for the material
 with which backfill is made.
 203.03.8.7--Compaction of Embankments. All embankment material shall be at the
 moisture content determined to be proper for the particular material being placed so that
 the resulting work will be both dense and stable.
 
 114
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to maintain the proper moisture content during
 compaction operations and the Engineer may require additional moisture or drying as
 necessary without additional compensation.
 The material shall be compacted until the required density, determined in accordance
 with Subsections 700.03 and 700.04, has been attained and the embankment is stable.
 Acceptance of compaction will be on a lot basis. A lot size will be based on the
 Contractor's hourly production rate as set out in Department's SOP.
 For basement and design soils, the required density shall be 95.0 percent and 98.0
 percent, respectively. If a density test is within minus two percent (-2.0%), 93.0 to 95.0%
 or 96.0 to 98.0%, of the required density, a verification test will be performed and the
 average of the two tests will be the test value for the lot. The lot shall be rejected if this
 test value does not meet the required density (95.0 or 98.0%). If the original test value
 exceeds minus two percent (-2%) of the required density, no verification test will be
 performed and the lot shall be rejected.
 Acceptance of compaction for structural backfill will be considered a separate frame of
 work. The backfill at each structure up to a depth of five feet will be considered a lot.
 For long structures, the Engineer may specify that the backfill be divided into smaller
 lots. Each lot will be divided into four approximately equal sublots with two density tests
 taken at random on each side of the structure. The single test and the lot average shall
 conform to the required densities set forth above for basement soils or design soils as
 applicable.
 The Contractor shall make allowance for shrinkage and compaction in the construction of
 embankment.
 203.03.8.8--Tolerances. The tolerances shown below as allowable shall not prevent the
 work from meeting the requirements of Subsection 105.03.
 Allowable vertical tolerances for design soils at subgrade elevation shall be in accordance
 with the tolerances set out in Section 321.
 The allowable horizontal tolerance at subgrade elevation will be five-tenths of a foot.
 The allowable tolerance from staked slopes on fills will be plus or minus five-tenths of a
 foot horizontally for each 10 feet of fill height except where surplus excavation is
 required or permitted by the Engineer for widening embankments or flattening slopes. In
 these cases tolerances will be modified accordingly.
 203.03.9--Site Grading. Site grading shall consist of excavating or shaping foreslopes,
 backslopes, or areas shown on the plans to the satisfaction of the Engineer. When site
 grading is performed and the yield of material from shaping the designated area is in
 excess of the material needed, such material will be removed and disposed of as directed
 by the Engineer. Payment of removed material will be made at the contract price for the
 class excavation involved.
 Clearing and grubbing, if required, shall be included in the bid item for clearing and
 grubbing. If no bid item for clearing and grubbing is included in the contract, it shall be
 
 115
 
 Section 203
 
 Section 203
 
 included in the contract unit price for site grading.
 The equipment used to site grade shall be capable of grading the site to a uniform and
 smooth surface as directed by the Engineer.
 203.03.10--Maintenance of Earthwork. The Contractor shall satisfactorily maintain all
 portions of the work until release of maintenance by the Engineer as referenced in
 Subsections 105.14, 105.15, 105.16 and 107.17. The Contractor shall replace, restore or
 reconstruct without extra compensation all portions, including materials, determined by
 the Engineer to have been displaced or damaged due to carelessness or negligence.
 Carelessness or negligence may include, but not be limited to, improperly maintained;
 inadequate drainage; failure to remove forms or obstructions; failure to properly
 prosecute and complete work within the specified time; neglecting to establish erosion
 control items in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 107.22 and Section 210 or
 other avoidable causes for displacement or damages.
 203.04--Method of Measurement. Items of excavation listed in the proposal will be
 measured as set forth herein, unless otherwise stipulated.
 203.04.1--Unclassified, Rock, Muck, Channel, Excess and Surplus Excavation.
 These items will be measured by the cubic yard final measure (FM) or loose vehicular
 measure (LVM) in accordance with Subsection 109.01. The unit of measurement for
 each item will be shown on the proposal bid sheets. Excavation identified as ESFE will
 not be measured for payment as excavation except as provided herein.

 SECTION 204 - GEOGRID REINFORCEMENT OF EMBANKMENT
 SLOPES AND SUBGRADES
 204.01--Description. This work shall consist of furnishing and installing geogrid for
 reinforcement of embankment slopes and/or subgrades as shown on the plans and in
 conformance with these specifications.
 204.02--Material Requirements. The geogrid shall meet the requirements of Subsection
 714.15.
 204.03--Construction Requirements.
 204.03.1--Preparation of Design Grade of Geogrid.
 204.03.1.1--Preparation of Foundation Soil. An embankment site that is to receive
 geogrid reinforcement upon the foundation soil shall be cleared and graded to establish a
 relatively smooth surface. Trees and stumps are to be cut off at the ground line and
 sawdust or sand placed over these areas to provide a cushion for the geogrid.
 204.03.1.2--Preparation of Basement Soils. An embankment that is to receive geogrid
 reinforcement located within the basement soil portion of the embankment shall be
 brought up to the proper grade as shown on the plans and compacted to the required
 density. The surface shall be left rough so as to provide for a good bond with the next
 embankment lift above the geogrid.
 204.03.1.3--Preparation of Design Soils or Subgrades. A design soil or subgrade that
 is to receive geogrid shall be shaped and compacted to the required density thus
 providing a smooth finish, free of loose material and sharp objects.
 204.03.2--Geogrid Installation. Geogrid shall be placed coincidently with the
 compacted lift nearest the design elevation shown on the plans. No partial or half-lift
 thicknesses are required; however, at no time shall the placement elevation deviate by
 more than one foot from the design grade.
 Correct orientation of the geogrid shall be verified by the Engineer.
 Geogrid shall be secured in-place to prevent movement while being covered.
 204.03.3--Overlaps and Joints.
 204.03.3.1--Uniaxial Geogrids. Uniaxial geogrid shall be placed in continuous
 longitudinal strips in the direction of main reinforcement and adjacent strips do not need
 to be overlapped. However, if the Contractor is unable to complete a required length
 with a single continuous length of geogrid, a joint may be made with the Engineer's
 approval. This joint shall be made for the full width of the strip by interlacing over and
 under the main reinforcing strands using a solid rod or hollow pipe of similar material
 and strength. No end joints will be allowed in any two adjacent strips or within 10 feet of
 the face of the embankment or, in the case of a spill through slope, in front of the
 abutment. In the event that the length of geogrid reinforcement is greater than the roll
 length, then end joints will be allowed in adjacent strips, but they cannot be within 75 feet
 of one another as measured along the length of the strip. Every effort should be made to
 
 118
 
 Section 204
 
 Section 204
 
 keep the number of end joints to a minimum and widely spaced throughout the placement
 area.
 204.03.3.2--Biaxial Geogrids. Biaxial geogrids shall be overlapped three (3) feet
 between adjacent strips and four (4) feet at the ends except where otherwise noted on the
 plans and/or in the contract documents.
 204.03.4--Placement of Fill over Geogrid. Fill placement shall conform to the
 requirements of Section 203. Extreme care shall be taken to prevent slippage of the
 geogrid during fill placement. The fill shall be back dumped and spread on the geogrid in
 uncompacted lifts of at least six (6) inches before equipment is allowed to continuously
 operate over it. At no time will tracked equipment be allowed to operate directly upon
 the geogrid. Rubber tired equipment will be allowed to pass over uncovered geogrid at
 speeds of less than 5 mph as directed by the Engineer. Any geogrid damage caused by
 fill placement or equipment movement over the geogrid will be uncovered and repaired
 as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the State.
 204.04--Method of Measurement. Geogrid of the type specified will be measured by
 the square yard of surface area covered. Any overwidth of geogrid installed and
 additional material required for laps or damage repairs will not be measured. No separate
 payment shall be made for shipping, handling, storage, protection, fabrication, securing
 pins or installation, the cost of which shall be included in the contract price for geogrid.
 204.05--Basis of Payment. Geogrid, measured as prescribed above, will be paid for at
 the contract unit price per square yard, which price shall be full compensation for
 furnishing and placing the geogrid, pins, lapping, joints, repairs, maintaining the geogrid
 until covered, and satisfactorily completing the work.
 Payment will be made under:
 204-A: Geogrid, Type ____
 
 - per square yard
 
 SECTION 205 - HAUL
 205.01--Description. When the contract contains a pay item for haul, it shall consist of
 transporting excavated material from its original position to its final location in the work.
 Haul is designated as Haul of Unclassified Excavation and Haul of Classification
 Excavation.
 205.02--Blank.
 205.03--Blank.
 205.04--Method of Measurement. Haul of excavation will be measured for payment
 only when the bid proposal contains a pay item for haul. The pay item will identify the
 excavation item for which haul is to be measured.
 Haul will be measured on a distance-volume or distance-weight basis. The distance being
 100-foot stations measured along the stationed control line of the project, and the volume
 or weight measured in the same manner as the excavation item.
 
 119
 
 Section 205
 
 Section 205
 
 In computing haul, it will be assumed that excavated material, including structure
 excavation, will be hauled the minimum distance and placed in the nearest embankment
 unless otherwise specified or directed. Cross-haul, when specified or directed by the
 Engineer, will be measured for payment.
 Haul will be computed by multiplying the units of excavation by the average distance it is
 hauled.
 When excavation is shown on the plans and in the proposal to be measured FM,
 computation of haul will be based on balanced final excavation and embankment
 quantities determined from final cross-sectional measurements.
 A balanced section will be considered as being between two points across which no
 excavation is hauled. A shrinkage factor will be determined for each balanced section to
 convert each embankment quantity to the excavation quantity required to construct the
 embankment.
 The center of volume for the cut will be the point where the accumulated yardage equals
 one-half the total excavation, and the center of volume for the embankment will be the
 point where the accumulated yardage equals one-half the total embankment. Within each
 balanced section, the average haul will be computed along the control line of the project
 as the distance between the center of volume for the excavation in its original position
 and the center of volume for the corresponding embankment in its final position.
 Embankment and excavation will be considered in sections not exceeding approximately
 1,000 feet in length. The center of volume of each section will be determined as set out
 in the previous paragraph and used in determining the average haul distance.
 Structure excavation used in construction of embankments will be included in the
 excavation quantities of each balanced division, and haul thereof will be determined as
 set out above.
 When the plans and proposal provide for haul of excavation measured as plan haul
 distance (P.H.D.), the final quantity for Haul of Excavation will be adjusted proportionate
 to the increase or decrease in the total excavation quantity determined from final crosssectional measurement of accepted work.
 205.05--Basis of Payment. Haul of excavation, measured as prescribed above, will be
 paid for at the contract unit price per station yard, which shall be full compensation for
 completing the work.
 Payment will be made under:
 205-A: Haul of Unclassified Excavation, FM or LVM
 
 - per station yard
 
 205-B: Haul of Classification Excavation, FM, FME or LVM
 
 - per station yard
 
 205-C: Haul of Classification Excavation, FM, FME or LVM, PHD

 SECTION 206 - STRUCTURE EXCAVATION
 FOR CONDUITS AND MINOR STRUCTURES
 
 206.01--Description. This work consists of the removal of material necessary for the
 construction of foundations for box culverts, box bridges, underdrains, pipe culverts and
 headwalls, and other minor structures when authorized by the section covering their
 construction. It shall also include all necessary pumping, bailing, drainage, cribbing or
 sheeting, other foundation work, and the backfilling and proper disposal of all excavated
 material as directed. Unless otherwise specified, excavation for pipe used as sidedrain
 will not be measured as structure excavation.
 206.02--Blank.
 206.03--Construction Requirements.
 206.03.1--Excavation. No excavation shall be made until the Engineer has cross
 sectioned and staked out the work. The Contractor shall exercise care to ensure that the
 adjacent natural ground is not unnecessarily disturbed or the foundation loosened below
 the bottom of the footing unless additional excavation is required.
 When the plans indicate or the Engineer directs removal of material classified in the
 contract as muck excavation or special excavation, the undercut shall be made and the
 area backfilled approximately one foot above the flow line of the structure and
 compacted to the required density before structure excavation is performed.
 Foundation areas shall be excavated to the footing elevations and dimensions shown on
 the plans or as established. The right is reserved to make adjustments in the location or
 flow line to provide adequate drainage and to make dimension changes in the footings to
 obtain a satisfactory foundation.
 In addition to the requirements of this subsection, excavation for pipe culverts will be
 performed in accordance with Subsection 603.03.
 Material encountered that is unsuitable for a stable foundation shall be excavated and
 backfilled as provided in Subsection 203.03.
 206.03.2--Backfill. All backfilling shall be in accordance with the requirements and
 provisions of Subsection 203.03.
 When the plans indicate or the Engineer orders removal of unsuitable material or other
 undercut below the normal grade line to provide a satisfactory foundation and further
 orders a specified depth of select material that may not be available from within the rightof-way or easement areas, the Contractor shall furnish a suitable backfill material such as
 sand, gravel, or other similar granular materials.
 206.04--Method of Measurement. Structure excavation acceptably performed will be
 measured as set forth herein.
 For structures other than pipe culverts, the area to be included in the measurement of
 structure excavation will be that area bounded by vertical planes one foot outside of the
 neat lines of the footing.
 
 121
 
 Section 206
 
 Section 206
 
 For pipe culverts, the vertical planes will be one foot each side of the nominal inside
 diameter of the pipe or less for tile and pipe underdrains if indicated on the plans. The
 length to be allowed will be one foot beyond each end of the pipe, except when the pipe
 is joined to another structure for which payment for structure excavation will be made. In
 this case, the length will be limited to the point of intersection of the centerline of the
 pipe with the boundary of structure excavation of joining structures.
 The depth allowed will be that actually removed between the natural ground line or the
 bottom of the graded section, whichever is lower, and the bottom of the footing or the
 bottom of the trench in the case of pipe. Measurement will not be made for excavation
 beyond the neat lines described which are made for the convenience or necessity of the
 Contractor’s operation.
 The volume of structure excavation allowed for payment will be the summation of the
 products of the widths, depths and lengths described.
 In case the Engineer orders additional excavation for foundation improvement below the
 depth indicated herein, this excavation within the designated neat lines will be measured
 as structure excavation.
 Unless otherwise specified, selected backfill material shown on the plans or directed by
 the Engineer to be produced from an area to be excavated under one of the classes of
 excavation set out in the contract will be measured and paid for under the applicable item
 of excavation.
 Any special ordered (select) material that is produced from excavation identified on the
 plans as E.S.F.E. will be measured for payment as contractor furnished select material.
 Select material ordered or authorized by Engineer to provide a satisfactory foundation for
 structures and conduit will be measured by the cubic yard (FM). Contractor furnished
 materials such as sand, gravel, granular materials, timber, etc. for backfilling will be paid
 at the contract unit price of the material used or as extra work in accordance with
 Subsection 104.03 when the pay item for select material for undercuts is not set up in the
 contract.
 Haul necessary to supply the selected material, other than Contractor-furnished, will be
 measured as set out in Section 205.
 No measurement will be made for water or other liquids removed.
 206.05--Basis of Payment. Structure excavation, measured as prescribed above, will be
 paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard which price shall be full compensation
 for the work.
 Special materials and/or methods of strengthening the foundation, ordered by the
 Engineer, will be paid for at the contract unit price for the material used; or, when no unit
 price is included in the contract, the work will be paid for as Extra Work in accordance
 with Subsection 104.03.

 SECTION 210 - ROADSIDE DEVELOPMENT
 210.01--General Provisions. Where the term "plant establishment" is used, it shall be
 understood to mean the work and time necessary to provide fully established, healthy
 vegetation.
 
 125
 
 Section 210
 
 Section 210
 
 Where the term "dormant" is used, it shall be understood to mean the temporary inactive
 stage of a living plant or seed. When the term "dormant season" is used, it shall be
 understood to mean a period of time during the year when germination and growth is not
 expected. It shall be further understood that the limits of the dormant season for each
 kind of plant shall be determined by the State Roadside Development Manager or
 authorized representative.
 Planting and establishment of vegetation shall be performed at the earliest practicable
 time consistent with other operations to provide that the maximum permanent or
 temporary vegetation is established as quickly as possible.
 The Contractor shall schedule work so finishing of all areas requiring vegetation can
 begin as soon as practicable. Finishing of such areas and the planting shall progress at
 the same rate as the work. The Contractor shall perform plant establishment throughout
 the life of the contract.
 The Contractor, upon written notification by the Engineer of noncompliance with the
 preceding two paragraphs, will have 48 hours, excluding Sunday, to correct the situation
 and comply with the specifications.
 Upon failure of the Contractor to comply with the written notification, the Engineer will
 suspend any or all operations in progress as deemed necessary to ensure compliance and
 may deduct from all subsequent estimates an amount equal to 30 percent of the value of
 all erosion control items completed between the suspension date and subsequent date of
 compliance. By execution of the contract, the Contractor agrees that such deduction will
 not be made as a penalty but as agreed reduction in pay for deficient performance by
 having failed to provide the Department with the maximum possible ground cover as
 intended under the contract.
 The requirements for growth and coverage for each kind of plant in its dormant season
 may be waived in areas in which planting, plant establishment, and maintenance have
 been performed in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, provided at least
 one kind of plantings that is not in its dormant season shows satisfactory growth and
 coverage.
 When contract time has expired and all work under the contract has been completed
 except for the specified growth and coverage of vegetation, liquidated damages will not
 be charged provided the Engineer's diary documents that the following conditions have
 been met:
 (a) The Contractor has complied with all instructions of the Engineer with regard to
 plant establishment, including but not limited to watering, replanting, mowing,
 and other work specified for plant establishment; and
 (b) The work is deemed to be in a satisfactory state of maintenance, or every
 reasonable effort is being made to provide satisfactory maintenance.
 When any of the conditions for waiver of liquidated damages have not been met,
 liquidated damages will be charged until the conditions are met or until release of
 maintenance, whichever occurs first.
 Some contracts may require that planting of trees and shrubs or other plantings be
 
 126
 
 Section 210
 
 Section 210
 
 completed by a specified date because of seasonal requirements for their planting. In the
 event the Contractor fails to complete these plantings within the specified period and
 must wait until the next season, liquidated damages will be charged after the specified
 completion date until completion of all plantings as specified and all other work under the
 contract is completed, except when the Engineer attests that all other work is completed;
 all the work is in a satisfactory state of maintenance; and the only remaining work which
 can be performed under the contract is continued plant establishment, only one-seventh
 of the specified deductions for liquidated damages will be made.

 plated or otherwise disposed of in a satisfactory manner. In no case shall topsoil be
 placed on slopes until conditioning of the areas has been approved.
 211.03.2--Application. It is intended that the application of topsoil, the application and
 incorporation of fertilizer, and other erosion control work will constitute continuous
 construction, and the Contractor’s operation shall be organized accordingly. When the
 Engineer has determined that the Contractor has made suitable arrangements to carry out
 these operations as indicated, topsoil shall be deposited on approved areas and spread to
 the required depth and section. When the required depth of plating material exceeds
 eight inches, it shall be placed in two or more approximately equal layers of no more than
 eight inches each.
 Objectionable foreign material, large clods that cannot be broken down, and oversize
 stones shall be removed and the area dressed to present a uniform appearance.
 211.03.3--Compaction. After spreading and shaping of the topsoil, compaction shall be
 performed to the degree that will provide a firm layer having a density of at least what
 might be expected from one complete coverage of a crawler type tractor track while the
 material is at a satisfactory moisture content.
 
 128
 
 Section 211
 
 Section 211
 
 211.03.4--Compacted Depth of Topsoil. Topsoil shall be deposited and spread in
 sufficient quantity so that, when compacted, it will have the depth specified in the
 contract.
 Determination of depth will be made at random and recorded following compaction of
 each plated area of approximately 20,000 square feet and more often if determined by the
 Engineer to be necessary to control the specified depth. Each of the plated areas will be
 considered a lot. The depth of each lot checked will be the average of at least two and
 not more than four measurements taken within a square yard area. Except as provided in
 the following two paragraphs, the average depth of each lot shall not vary from the
 specified depth by more than one inch or 25 percent of the specified depth, whichever is
 larger. The average depth of the entire area topsoiled, or the average of the depths of
 individual lots, shall not vary from the specified depth by more than one inch.
 Topsoil measured and paid for on a cubic yard basis may exceed the stated plus
 tolerances, provided the finished surface is uniform, does not obstruct drainage, and
 otherwise meets the approval of the Engineer; and further provided that in lieu of the
 Contractor removing the excess materials at no additional cost to the State, a reduction in
 pay quantity in the amount of the excess will be made. The excess in each lot will be
 computed by multiplying the depth in excess of the specified depth plus the tolerance by
 the area of the lot and the computed excess volume in cubic yards converted to loose
 vehicular measure by multiplying by 1.25.
 Topsoil specified to be measured and paid for on a square yard basis may exceed the
 stated plus tolerance and remain in place provided the finished surface is uniform, does
 not obstruct drainage, and otherwise meets the approval of the Engineer. No additional
 payment will be made for the excessive material placed. The removal of excessive
 topsoil shall be at the election of the Contractor and at no additional cost to the State.
 211.03.5--Topsoil for Plant Holes or Pits. When specified or ordered, topsoil shall be
 used for backfill material for plant holes or pits. Placement shall be in accordance with
 the applicable provisions of the specifications for the specified plantings.

 establishment on all areas seeded. All the work shall be in accordance with the plans and
 these specifications.
 214.02--Materials. Seeds shall meet the requirements of Subsection 715.03, subject to
 the provisions of this subsection. The Contractor shall acquire seed from supplier
 registered with the MDAC.
 Except for the germination test as referenced in Subsection 715.03, bags of seeds
 properly labeled or tagged according to law and indicating characteristics meeting or
 exceeding the requirements of these specifications will be acceptable for planting.
 The Contractor shall provide adequate dry and otherwise protected and approved storage
 facilities for seeds, and shall furnish access to the storage for sampling and for the
 Engineer to inventory stored seed and inspect the suitability of the storage facilities.
 Seeds that have been sampled and tested by the MDAC shall be acceptable for planting
 provided (1) that prior to planting, the Contractor furnishes the Engineer two copies of
 test reports from the MDAC indicating that the seeds meet the germination requirements,
 (2) not more than nine months have elapsed, exclusive of the calendar month in which the
 test was completed, between the germination test data and the time of planting, and (3)
 the seeds were properly stored and handled.
 Seeds that have not been sampled and tested by the MDAC and test reports furnished
 prior to planting shall be sampled and tested for germination requirements by the
 Department.
 The Contractor may use pre-tested, or post-tested seeds under the conditions stated
 herein. For seeds to be pre-tested, approximately 35 days from the date of sampling will
 
 133
 
 Section 214
 
 Section 214
 
 be required to obtain the test results.
 When pre-tested seeds are planted, a minus tolerance of five percent of the specified
 germination percentage will be allowed without adjustment. Seeds failing to comply by
 more than five percent may be planted, provided the rate of seeding is increased by 100
 percent of the deficiency with the same or approved seeds, without additional
 compensation.
 The Engineer may permit the Contractor to plant post-tested seeds, provided the seeds are
 properly tagged and have indicated characteristics meeting the requirements of these
 specifications without applying tolerances. If the seeds are planted, the Contractor shall
 assume full responsibility for the specified percent germination of the seeds upon
 subsequent tests. Acceptance or re-sowing will be based on the results of the subsequent
 tests. A minus tolerance of five percent of the specified germination percentage will be
 allowed without adjustment. If the tests indicate a deficiency in excess of five percent;
 (1) the deficiency shall be corrected by immediately re-sowing an amount of seeds equal
 to 200 percent of the deficiency with the same or approved seeds without additional
 compensation, or (2) should it be determined, by inspection, that a sufficient number of
 seeds have germinated to produce satisfactory growth and coverage, the Engineer will
 deduct from measured quantities an amount of seeds equal to l00 percent of the
 deficiency. Otherwise, the area seeded will not be considered in reasonably close
 conformity with the requirements of these specifications.
 214.03--Construction Requirements.
 214.03.1--General. Prior to planting the seeds, topsoil when specified, ground
 preparation, and fertilizing shall have been satisfactorily performed and the area approved
 by the Engineer.
 Seeding may be required for temporary protection or for establishment of permanent
 ground cover. The plans will indicate temporary seeding.
 The rates of application, kinds, and the planting dates of seeds shall be as set out in the
 vegetation schedule on the plans. The Engineer will determine the actual quantity of
 seeds to be applied on individual areas of not more than three acres.
 Legume seeds shall be treated in accordance with Subsection 715.03.4 immediately
 before sowing. Seeds shall be uniformly sown over the entire area with approved
 mechanical seeders. Seeds of different sizes may necessitate separate sowing. Should
 legume seeds become dry, they shall be re-inoculated.
 Seeding shall not be done during windy weather or when the ground is frozen, extremely
 wet, or in a condition that will not allow the soil to be properly tilled.
 All seeds shall be covered lightly with soil by raking, rolling, or other approved methods,
 and the area compacted with a cultipacker.
 When specified, mulching shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of
 Section 215 as soon as practicable but no later than 24 hours after seeding unless weather
 conditions are such that mulch cannot be placed.

 Section 214
 
 214.03.2--Plant Establishment. The Contractor shall provide plant establishment on all
 areas seeded until release of maintenance.
 Plant establishment shall be provided for a minimum period of 45 calendar days after
 completion of seeding. In the event satisfactory growth and coverage has not been
 attained by the end of the 45-day period, plant establishment shall be continued until the
 specified growth and coverage is provided for at least one kind of plant as referenced in
 Section 210. The Contractor shall perform plant establishment on all areas of temporary
 seeding until the Engineer determines that the temporary seeding has served its purpose.
 Plant establishment shall consist of preserving, protecting, watering, reseeding, mowing,
 and other work necessary to keep the seeded areas in satisfactory condition.
 Unless otherwise permitted, areas requiring reseeding shall be prepared and seeded and
 all other work performed in accordance with the requirements of the contract as if the
 reseeding was the initial seeding. The types and application rates of fertilizer will be
 determined by soil tests or otherwise established.
 214.03.3--Growth and Coverage. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to provide
 satisfactory growth and coverage of grasses, legumes, or combination produced from the
 specified seeding.
 Growth and coverage on seeded areas will be considered to be in reasonably close
 conformity with the intent of the contract when the type of vegetation specified, exclusive
 of that from seeds not expected to have germinated and shows growth at that time, has
 reached a point of maturity where stems or runners overlap adjacent similar growth in
 each direction over the entire area.
 214.04--Method of Measurement. Seeding will be measured by the acre, or by the
 pound, as indicated in the contract.
 Except as provided under Subsection 107.17, no measurement for payment will be made
 for any materials or work required under Subsections 214.03.2 and 214.03.3.
 Watering for seeding will not be measured for separate payment.

 material shall be a minimum 90% straw and essentially free from plastic materials or
 
 136
 
 Section 215
 
 Section 215
 
 other non-bio degradable substances. The material shall be dispersed into a uniform
 mulch slurry when mixed with water.
 215.02.1.5--Tackifier. The tackifier will serve the purpose of an adhesive to form a bond
 between the soil, fiber, and seed particles. It will also allow the soil to retain moisture.
 The tackifier shall be of the organic or synthetic variety.
 215.03--Construction Requirements.
 215.03.1--Equipment. Mulching equipment shall be capable of maintaining a constant
 air stream that will blow or eject controlled quantities of mulch in a uniform pattern. If
 asphalt is used, a jet or spray nozzle for applying uniform, controlled amounts of asphalt
 to the vegetative material as it is ejected shall be located at or near the discharge spout.
 Mulch stabilizers shall consist of dull blades or disks without camber and approximately
 20 inches in diameter. The disks shall be notched, shall be spaced at approximately 8inch intervals, and shall be equipped with scrapers. The stabilizer shall weigh
 approximately 1000 to 1200 pounds, shall have a working width of no more than eight
 feet, and shall be equipped with a ballast compartment, so that when directed weight can
 be increased.
 215.03.2--Placement of Vegetative Mulch. Mulching shall be placed uniformly on
 designated areas within 24 hours following seeding unless weather conditions are such
 that mulching cannot be performed. Placement shall begin on the windward side of areas
 and from tops of slopes. In its final position the mulch shall be loose enough to allow air
 to circulate but compact enough to partially shade the ground and reduce erosion.
 The baled material shall be loosened and broken thoroughly before it is fed into the
 machine to avoid placement of unbroken clumps.
 215.03.3--Rates of Application and Anchoring Mulch. The Engineer will designate
 the rate of application of vegetative mulch within the limits of one to two tons per acre.
 The mulch may be anchored by either the use of a mulch stabilizer or by tacking with
 bituminous material. If a mulch stabilizer is used, the mulch shall be punched into the
 soil for a minimum depth of one inch. If bituminous material is used, the rate of
 application shall be 150 gallons per acre.
 Where steep slopes or other conditions are such that anchoring cannot be performed
 satisfactory with a mulch stabilizer, the Engineer will require the bituminous material be
 applied at the time or immediately following the mulch placement.
 When mulch stabilizers are used, anchoring the mulch shall be performed along the
 contour of the ground surface.
 As the work progresses, the Engineer will determine the actual rate of application of the
 vegetative mulch and the bituminous material, if used, on each area not to exceed three
 acres. For vegetative mulch, a tolerance of 15 percent will be permitted without
 correction. For bituminous material, if used, a tolerance of 10 percent will be permitted
 without correction. Areas deficient in application by more than these amounts shall be
 corrected by reapplication in a manner approved by the Engineer. For areas on which
 vegetative material has been placed in excess of the tolerance permitted, that portion of
 
 137
 
 Section 215
 
 Section 215
 
 the material placed in excess of the tolerance allowed will be deducted from the measured
 quantities. In the event an excess of vegetative material has been placed in a quantity
 deemed by the Engineer to be undesirable, the Contractor shall remove and replace all
 material placed on that area at no additional cost to the State.
 215.03.4--Protection and Maintenance. The Contractor shall maintain and protect
 mulched areas until release of maintenance of the project. The Contractor shall take
 every precaution to prevent unnecessary foot and vehicular traffic and shall repair and
 restore immediately any displacement of mulch without extra compensation.
 At appropriate times determined by the Engineer, the Contractor shall mow or otherwise
 remove or destroy all undesirable growth on all areas mulched to prevent competition
 with the desired plants and to prevent reseeding of undesirable growth. All mowing shall
 be a part of protection and maintenance.
 215.03.5--Hydromulch. Hydromulch shall be applied in accordance with the installation
 instructions and recommendations of the manufacturer. Hydromulch shall be uniformly
 applied at the manufacturer’s recommended application rate. In no case shall the
 application rate be less than one (1) ton per acre.
 215.03.5.1--Protection and Maintenance. The Contractor should maintain and protect
 mulched areas until the Release of Maintenance of the project. The Contractor should
 take every precaution to prevent unnecessary foot and vehicular traffic.
 The Contractor should mow, remove or destroy any undesirable growth on all areas
 mulched as soon as any undesirable growth appears. This will prevent competition with
 the desired plants and to prevent reseeding of undesirable growth.
 215.03.5.2--Hydro Equipment. The equipment for hydraulically applying seed and
 mulch shall have a built-in agitation system with an operating capacity sufficient to
 agitate, suspend, and homogeneously mix slurry of the specified amount of fiber, seed,
 and water. The slurry distribution lines shall be large enough to prevent stoppage. The
 discharge line shall be equipped with a set of hydraulic spray nozzles, which will provide
 even distribution of the slurry on the various areas to be seeded.
 The mixture shall all be combined into the slurry tank for distribution of all ingredients in
 one operation as specified herein. The materials shall be combined in a manner
 recommended by the manufacturer. The slurry mixture shall be so regulated that the
 amounts and rates of application shall result in a uniform application of all materials at
 rates not less than the amounts specified. Using the color of the mulch as a guide, the
 equipment operator shall spray the prepared seedbed with a uniform visible coat. The
 slurry shall be applied in a sweeping motion, in an arched stream, so as to fall like rain,
 allowing the mulch to build upon each other until an even coat is achieved.
 215.04--Method of Measurement. Accepted quantities of vegetative material for mulch
 will be measured by the ton.
 The weight for measurement will be the product of the number of bales acceptably placed
 and the average weight per bale as determined on approved scales provided by the
 Contractor.

 overnight. All trash and debris is defined as all trash, debris, litter, junk, rubbish, paper,
 cardboard, glass, cans, styrofoam cups, discarded items, garbage, old tires, treads, etc.
 The Contractor will not be required to pick up such items as cigarette butts, tiny chips of
 grass or other small items not readily visible to the traveling public.
 The Engineer will advise the Contractor when mowing will be needed. The Engineer has
 the right to eliminate completely or partially any mowing on the project. The Engineer
 will advise the Contractor of the area to be mowed and the time to begin the mowing
 operations. The Engineer may delay mowing of lespedezas or crimson clover until after
 these plants have gone to seed. Mowing may be delayed to retain and promote desirable
 wildflower growth.
 Mowing will be to a height of not more than six (6) inches and will include trimming
 adjacent to culvert ends, guard rail, sign posts or other appurtenances. Trimming
 adjacent to objects inaccessible by mower shall be performed by hand mowers, weedeaters, sling blades, or any acceptable means necessary to complete the work. Care shall
 be taken not to damage trees, plants, shrubs, delineators or other fixtures that are part of
 the facility. Any damages by the Contractor’s operations to signs, delineators, other
 traffic control devices or other appurtenances shall be corrected immediately at no
 additional cost to the State.

 Section 228
 
 On long slopes, an intermediate anchor trench shall be installed at 50-foot intervals.
 228.03.3--Placement of Blanket. Starting at the crest of the slope, the erosion control
 blanket shall be rolled down the slope in a controlled manner. Approximately every 25
 feet, the erosion control blanket shall be pulled to take out any excess slack. The goal is
 to have the erosion control blanket contour and initiate full contact with the soil.
 The typical installation will require one stake placed at 3-foot to 5-foot intervals along the
 vertical length of the erosion control blanket. Stakes shall be staggered 18 to 24 inches
 horizontally across the erosion control blanket. If the erosion control blanket needs to be
 spliced in the middle of a slope, the erosion control blanket shall be "shingled" with upslope erosion control blanket overlapping the down-slope erosion control blanket. There
 should be a minimum of six inches of overlap in a splice. The joint splice shall be made
 by placing a row of stakes six inches on center and then placing a second row of stakes
 six inches on center, staggered from the first row. All overlaps and the edges shall be
 secured with stakes. All longitudinal and transverse laps shall be a minimum 6-inch joint
 with the upgrade section on top. All transverse laps shall be staked with two staggered
 rows of stakes on 6-inch centers. All longitudinal laps shall be stakes with two staggered
 rows on 3-foot to 5-foot centers. The staking shall firmly anchor the fabric netting to the
 soil surface.
 On the downstream end of blankets adjoining a structure, the anchor trench shall be
 omitted and the material folded six inches and butted tightly against the structure and one
 row of stakes installed on six-inch centers. An edge adjacent to a paved ditch shall be
 butted tightly against the paved ditch and a row of stakes installed on 12-inch centers.
 All stakes shall be driven flush with the soil surfaces.

 231.02.4--Inspection. All seedlings are subject to inspection at any time during the life
 of the contract by an authorized representative of the Department. However, inspections
 before or during planting operations shall not be construed as final acceptance of the
 seedlings.
 231.02.5--Fertilizer. Fertilizer(s) shall meet the applicable requirements of Section 213
 or Section 232, as specified.
 231.03--Construction Requirements.
 231.03.1--Equipment. The furnished tools and equipment for digging plant holes, slits
 or trenches shall be adequate to perform the excavation to the proper size and depth such
 that twisted, balled, or "U" roots will not result. All equipment and tools shall meet the

 231.03.8--Application of Fertilizer. Fertilizer shall be the types and shall be applied at
 the rate and in the manner specified.
 231.03.9--Inspection of Seedlings. Inspection of planted seedlings will be made by the
 Engineer before the end of the first full growing season. On or about October 1,
 determinations will be made by the Engineer of the survival of each species of seedling.
 The Engineer will divide the portion of the project on which each species of seedling is
 planted into lots as deemed necessary to represent segments of the work in which survival
 characteristics are similar. At the discretion of the Engineer, the percentage of survival of
 seedlings will be determined by sampling from each of the lots selected or the percentage
 of survival in any lot may be determined from the ratio of the actual count of seedlings
 within the lot at the time of the inspection to the total number of seedlings required to
 plant the lot in accordance with the spacing requirements of the contract.
 In the determination of the percentage of survival sampling from areas planted, the
 Engineer will select at random, from within each lot selected, one or more increments,
 each of which shall be not less than one-tenth acre or ten percent of the area of the lot,
 whichever is smaller. The area of each increment selected within the lot will be measured
 and, if more than one increment is selected, their areas will be combined. The number of
 surviving seedlings within the selected increment(s) of the lot will be counted. The
 percentage of the survival of the lot will be established by dividing the combined count of
 surviving seedlings thus obtained by the total number of seedlings required for the
 combined areas of the increments when planted in accordance with the spacing
 requirements of the contract.
 The survival percentage of each species for the project will be established by multiplying
 the survival percentage for each lot by the area of each such lot and dividing the sum of
 these products by the total area planted.
 As determined during this inspection, the Engineer will either require replacement of
 dead, defective, or missing seedlings or not require replacement of such seedlings at
 certain locations.

 Section 231
 
 Section 231
 
 231.03.10--Replacement or Non-Replacement of Seedlings.
 231.03.10.1--Replacement. The Contractor may be directed by the Engineer to replace
 certain dead, defective, or missing seedlings. Replacements shall be made at the earliest
 practicable time during the planting season following the first growing season. All
 replacement plantings shall be in accordance with the requirements applicable to initial
 planting.
 231.03.10.2--Non-Replacement. Certain seedlings found to be dead, defective, or
 missing may not be ordered replaced if non-replacement would not adversely affect the
 planting design.
 231.04--Method of Measurement. Seedlings of the type specified, in place, undamaged,
 and healthy at the time of final inspection, will be measured per thousand seedlings.
 At the discretion of the Engineer, the total number of acceptable seedlings in place at the
 time of final inspection will be determined by sampling from areas planted or by actual
 count of acceptable surviving seedlings. The Engineer will divide the portion of the
 project on which each species of seedlings is planted into lots as deemed necessary to
 represent areas of the work on which survival characteristics are similar. Within each
 such lot, in the case of determination by sampling, the Engineer will select at random one
 or more increments, each of which shall be not less than one-tenth acre or ten percent of
 area of the lot, whichever is smaller. The area of the lot will be determined and the area
 of each increment selected within the lot will be measured and, if more than one
 increment is selected within the lot, the areas of such increments will be combined. The
 number of acceptable surviving seedlings within the increment or increments, as the case
 may be, will be counted. The number of acceptable surviving seedlings within the
 increment or increments thus determined shall be multiplied by the ratio between the area
 of the lot and the area of the increment or increments, as the case may be, to give the total
 number of surviving seedlings in the lot.
 In lieu of such determination by the specified sampling method, the Engineer may elect
 to determine the total number of acceptable surviving seedlings in place in any lot at the
 time of final inspection by actual count.
 The number of acceptable seedlings of each species in place on the project at the time of
 final inspection shall be the summation of the number of acceptable surviving seedlings
 of each species determined for each lot.
 Fertilizer(s) ordered and acceptably used will be measured and paid for under Section
 213 or Section 232.
 Measurement for payment will be made in the following sequence:
 When all seedlings have been planted in accordance with the contract, 65 percent of the
 unit price will be allowed.
 When the inspection of seedlings at the end of the first growing season (October 1) as set
 out in Subsection 231.03.9 determines that the survival rate exceed 65 percent for one or
 more of the individual species, sizes and types, the same percentage of the unit price will
 be allowed as the survival rate, but not to exceed 75 percent.
 
 177
 
 Section 231
 
 Section 231
 
 At the end of the second planting season and after all ordered replacement seedlings have
 been properly planted and the survival rate at the end of the first growing season was
 determined to exceed 75 percent for one or more of the individual species, sizes and
 types, the same percentage of the unit price will be allowed as the survival rate, but not to
 exceed 80 percent.
 At the end of the second growing season, 90 percent of the unit price will be allowed for
 surviving seedlings, trees and shrubs.
 Upon release of maintenance, 100 percent of the unit price will be allowed for surviving
 seedlings, trees and shrubs meeting the requirements of the contract.

 Section 304
 
 304.03.5--Shaping, Compacting, and Finishing. Each course or layer of material shall
 be shaped to the required section, watered or aerated as necessary to provide the needed
 moisture content for compaction, and compacted. Throughout the compaction operation,
 the shape of the course or layer shall be maintained by blading and rolling so that the
 aggregates are uniformly distributed and firmly keyed.
 Shaping and compaction shall be carried out in a manner that will prevent lamination and
 shall continue until the entire depth and width of the course or layer has reached the
 required density. Surface compaction and finishing shall be performed so as to produce a
 smooth, closely knit surface that is free from lamination, cracks, ridges or loose material.
 The finished surface shall conform, within allowable tolerances, to the required section
 and established lines and grades. Allowable tolerances are set out in Section 321.
 Prior to subsequent construction or release of maintenance, all irregularities, depressions,
 soft spots, and other deficiencies found by the Engineer shall be corrected to meet the
 requirements of these specifications without additional compensation.
 After compaction and finishing, if the mixture contains plus No. 4 aggregate and the
 course is to serve as a base for bituminous pavement, at least one complete coverage shall
 be made with a steel wheel roller. The resulting surface shall be sprinkled as necessary to
 maintain the required moisture content and shall be thoroughly compacted and sealed
 with a pneumatic roller.
 In addition to the requirements for density and correction of deficiencies, the Contractor
 shall be responsible for constructing and maintaining a course that will remain firm and
 stable under construction equipment and other traffic which the course will be subjected
 to prior to release of maintenance.
 Density tests will be performed in accordance with the methods as provided in
 Subsections 700.03 and 700.04.
 Determination of acceptance of compaction of granular courses for required density will
 be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be each 2,500 linear feet per layer placed.
 At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of a lot completed during a day's
 operation may be considered as a separate lot or may be included in the previous or the
 subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than one full lot will be considered
 a lot.
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The individual tests and the average of the five tests shall equal

 Section 305
 
 Section 305
 
 When measurement for payment for stabilizer aggregate is to be made by the ton, the
 Contractor shall furnish approved platform scales capable of weighing the entire loaded
 vehicle. Scales and their use shall be in accordance with the requirements set out in
 Subsection 40l.03.2.1.11, except they shall be installed at an approved location on or near
 the project.
 305.03.2--Processing.
 305.03.2.1--Before Addition of Stabilizer Aggregate. The material to be modified shall
 be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 321. In addition, if the
 existing surface consists of bituminous surfacing, the surfacing shall be scarified,
 pulverized, and thoroughly mixed until all the material will pass a three-inch sieve. The
 material shall then be brought to the designated lines, grades, and cross sections and to
 the required density.
 To ensure proper prosecution of the work, sufficient roadbed shall be prepared in advance
 of spreading stabilizer aggregate.
 305.03.2.2--After Addition of Stabilizer Aggregate. After the roadbed and in-place
 material have been prepared as specified and approved, the designated quantity of
 aggregate to be added shall be uniformly spread.
 The Contractor shall organize the work so that delay in spreading and incorporation of
 aggregate will be only for the time necessary to haul the required quantity of stabilizer
 materials on a section of sufficient length to permit a single effective spreading, mixing,
 shaping, and compacting operation. Dumping of long lines of stabilizer aggregates on
 the roadbed and prolonged periods of hauling adjacent thereto will not be permitted.
 Unless wet soil conditions prevent satisfactory manipulation, aggregates shall be
 incorporated not later than the following day.
 Preliminary scarifying shall be carefully controlled, and the undisturbed foundation
 beneath the loose material shall have a crown conforming as nearly as practicable to that
 of the finished course.
 Mixing shall immediately follow the proper distribution of the aggregate and shall be
 performed with rotary or other agitating type mixers, supplemented by other equipment
 as necessary to pulverize the materials and thoroughly incorporate each into the other so
 that the resulting course will be uniform throughout. During mixing, sufficient water
 shall be added to bring the material to the proper moisture content.
 Mixing shall be carefully controlled to provide an undisturbed underlying foundation at
 the designed grade and cross section, and shall be continued until a minimum of 95.0
 percent of all materials, exclusive of individual rocks or stone, will pass a two-inch sieve.
 The first section of each modified course constructed will serve as a test section. The
 length of the test section shall be determined by the capabilities of the equipment selected
 to perform the work but will be at least 1000 feet and not more than 1500 feet for the
 designated width. The Contractor and Engineer will evaluate the results of the test
 section in relation to contract requirements. In case the Engineer determines the work
 does not comply with contract requirements, the Contractor’s procedure and augment or
 equipment shall be revise as necessary to provide work completed in accordance with the
 
 198
 
 Section 305
 
 Section 305
 
 contract and shall correct all deficient work at no additional cost to the State.
 The Contractor shall be fully responsible for damage to or contamination of the
 underlying material or shoulder material and shall make corrections as necessary at no
 additional cost to the State.
 For the purpose of determining reasonable conformity with the designated width of a
 course, the width of a course shall not vary from the designated edge lines by more than
 plus or minus three inches.
 A course whose compacted thickness is designated to be more than eight inches shall be
 constructed in two or more layers of approximately equal thickness. The maximum
 compacted thickness of any one layer shall not exceed eight inches.
 No material shall be placed on or mixed with frozen material.
 305.03.3--Shaping, Compacting and Finishing. Compaction shall start longitudinally
 at the outer edges of the course and proceed toward the center. The material shall be
 sprinkled or aerated as necessary during compaction to maintain the needed moisture
 content for compaction.
 Shaping and compacting shall be carried out in a manner that will prevent lamination and
 shall continue until the entire depth and width of the course has reached the required
 density. Throughout the entire compaction operation, the shape of the course shall be
 maintained by blading and rolling. Surface compaction and finishing shall be performed
 so as to produce a smooth, closely knit surface, free from lamination, cracks, ridges, or
 loose material, and conforming to the required section and established lines and grades.
 Prior to subsequent construction or release of maintenance, all irregularities, depressions,
 soft spots, and other deficiencies shall be corrected to meet the requirements of these
 specifications without additional compensation.
 Density tests will be performed in accordance with the methods as provided in
 Subsection 700.03 and 700.04.
 Determination of acceptance of compaction of in-grade modification for required density
 will be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be 2,500 linear feet per layer placed.
 At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of a lot completed during a day's
 operation may be considered as a separate lot or may be included in the previous or the
 subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than one full lot will be considered
 a lot.
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The average of the five density tests shall equal or exceed 93.0
 percent with no single density test below 89.0 percent.
 In addition to the requirements for density and correction of deficiencies, the Contractor
 shall be fully responsible for constructing and maintaining a course which will remain
 firm and stable under construction equipment and other traffic the course will be
 subjected to prior to release of maintenance.
 
 199
 
 Section 305
 
 Section 305
 
 The finished surface of a course shall conform to the requirements shown on the plans
 within the tolerances allowable under Section 321 and shall be maintained until covered
 by a subsequent course or the work is released from maintenance.
 305.04--Method of Measurement. Processing for in-grade modification will be
 measured by the square yard, station, or mile, as designated.
 Stabilizer aggregates of the type or size specified will be measured by the cubic yard
 (LVM) or by the ton, as indicated in the bid schedule of the contract. No measurement
 for payment for water will be made.
 When the method of measurement is by the ton, measurement will be made on the dry
 unit weight basis at the point of weighing. The moisture determination for computing the
 dry unit weight will be made in accordance with the methods set out in Subsection 700.03
 at least once a day, and as many additional times as the Engineer deems necessary.
 305.05--Basis of Payment. Processing for in-grade modification will be paid for at the
 contract unit price per unit specified. Stabilizer aggregate will be paid for at the contract
 unit price per unit specified, which price shall be full compensation for completing the

 SECTION 307 - LIME TREATED COURSES
 307.01--Description. This work consists of constructing one or more courses of a
 mixture of soil, hydrated lime and water, or a mixture of soil and hydrated lime slurry in
 accordance with these specifications and in reasonably close conformity with the lines,
 grades, thicknesses, and typical cross sections shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer. When lime slurry is used the Contractor shall mix hydrated lime with water to
 produce lime slurry or, at the Contractor’s option, produce lime slurry at the job site by
 the use of equipment specifically manufactured for the slaking of quick lime.
 The use of quick lime by the dry application method will not be allowed unless the lime
 meets the requirements of Subsection 714.03.3.2 for Dry Quick Lime.
 The work shall include preparation of the roadbed, incorporation of lime or lime slurry,
 and processing to the proper grade, section and density in accordance with one of the
 following methods:
 
 200
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 Class A lime treatment shall consist of spreading and incorporating the specified
 percentage of lime in two increments in the following sequence: spreading the first
 increment, initial mixing, mellowing, spreading the second increment, final mixing,
 compacting, and finishing.
 Class B lime treatment shall consist of spreading the specified percentage of lime,
 initial mixing, mellowing, final mixing, compacting, and finishing.
 Class C lime treatment shall consist of spreading the specified percentage of lime,
 mixing, compacting, and finishing.
 Occasionally, the scheduling of contract lettings results in advertising a project before the
 final soil profile is available, and it is not possible to determine, prior to advertising, the
 precise class of lime treatment required. Design considerations, therefore, sometimes
 necessitate changing the class(es) of lime treatment in order to obtain the contemplated
 structural qualities without unnecessary cost.
 The Department reserves the right to modify by Supplemental Agreement or Quantity
 Adjustment the class of treatment or to eliminate lime treatment from certain sections or
 to add other sections for lime treatment depending on the results of soil tests.
 307.02--Materials.
 307.02.1--Materials to be Treated. The material to be treated shall consist of existing
 roadbed material or material added as directed. Particles of aggregate retained on a threeinch sieve and deleterious substances such as roots, stumps, grass turfs, and other
 vegetable matter shall be removed from the soil. Material considered by the Engineer to
 be unsuitable for stabilization shall be removed and replaced with suitable material.
 307.02.2--Water. Water used in this construction shall meet the requirements of
 Subsection 714.01.3.
 307.02.3--Lime. Lime shall be either a commercial dry hydrated lime or a commercial
 dry, granular or pelletized quick lime meeting the applicable requirements of Subsection
 714.03. When bulk lime is used, the Contractor shall provide means suitable to the
 Engineer for applying. The Engineer shall weigh shipments at random for verification of
 bulk lime quantities.
 307.02.4--Curing Seals. Curing seal shall be Emulsified Asphalt, Grade EA-1, EPR-1,
 AE-P, CSS-1, SS-1, CMS-2h, or MS-2h meeting the applicable requirements of Section
 702.
 307.02.5--Soil-Lime Design. Quantities and percentages of lime shown on the plans are
 preliminary. The actual application rate will be established from tests made prior to
 beginning treatment. The design of soil-lime courses shall be performed by the Central
 Laboratory. At least 45 days prior to the proposed use of a lime course, the Contractor
 shall make available materials proposed for use in the mixture for sampling and testing
 by the Department as the Engineer may consider necessary for the establishment of a mix
 design.
 
 201
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 Changes in source of lime shall not be made without approval. Approval will be based
 on verification of a mix design.
 307.03--Construction Requirements.
 307.03.1--General. Quantities and percentages of lime shown on the plans and in the
 proposal are based on preliminary soil investigations and dry laboratory sample tests.
 The actual application rates will be established from tests made just prior to beginning
 treatment. The Contractor is advised that the estimated quantity of lime is based on
 application rates of hydrated lime.
 It is necessary that lime treated materials be kept moist at all times. It shall be the
 Contractor's responsibility to provide sufficient equipment and keep all partially
 constructed or completed lime stabilized layers sufficiently and continually moist until a
 succeeding layer has been placed thereon or until the project is released from
 maintenance.
 The first section of each mixing operation, both initial and final, will serve as a test
 section. The length of the test section will be determined by the capabilities of the
 equipment provided to perform the work, but not less than 350 linear feet nor more than
 500 linear feet for the designated width. The Engineer and the Contractor will evaluate
 the results of the test section in relation to contract requirements. In case the Engineer
 determines the work is not satisfactory, the Contractor shall revise procedures and
 augment or replace equipment as necessary to assure work is completed in accordance
 with the contract and shall correct all deficient work at no additional cost to the State.
 Also within the test section and only when the dry-application method of quicklime is
 used, a sample of the soil-lime-water mixture shall be taken after the completion of the
 mixing operation. This sample shall be taken, by the Contractor, to an independent
 testing laboratory to determine, using the X-ray Diffraction Test or the Titration Analysis
 Test, the percent of hydration. After the completion of the test section, the Contractor
 shall not continue operations until the results of the test sample have been determined.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with three copies of a certified test report
 showing that the non-hydrated content of the sample has not exceeded one percent (1.0%)
 of the total mix. Should the sample not meet the hydration requirements, the Contractor
 shall re-mix the section and add sufficient water until satisfactory results are achieved.
 All testing costs associated with determining the hydration efficiency of the sample(s)
 will be at no additional cost to the State. The Department reserves the right to make
 hydration verification checks of the soil-lime-water mixture at any time.
 307.03.2--Equipment. The methods and equipment used in performing the work shall
 conform to the requirements of Subsection 108.05. Equipment necessary for proper
 prosecution of the work shall be on the project and approved by the Engineer prior to its
 use.
 When bulk lime is used, the Contractor shall provide approved mechanical spreader(s)
 having adjustable strike-off gate(s), or other approved spreading equipment constructed
 so as to provide positive control of the spread. Approval of a spreader will be contingent
 upon its known or demonstrated ability to make distribution of lime within the tolerances
 allowable.
 
 202
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 Mixing and scarifying equipment shall be capable of positive depth control. Mixing shall
 be performed with approved rotary-type mixers or other approved equipment.
 Rollers shall be of sufficient number, type, size, and weight to accomplish the required
 compaction.
 The Contractor may use approved alternate equipment provided it produces work
 meeting the requirements of these specifications.
 307.03.3--Preparation of Grade. Before treatment, the roadbed shall be prepared in
 accordance with the requirements of Section 321.
 Prior to the application of dry hydrated lime, a light windrow shall be bladed along the
 edges of the area to be treated, or the surface on which the lime is to be applied shall be
 scarified to retain the spread.
 Prior to the application of slurry, the full width of the area shall be scarified or partially
 pulverized to the depth necessary to retain the lime slurry until it has been incorporated.
 The depth of scarification shall be carefully controlled so that the surface of the roadbed
 below the scarified material will remain undisturbed and conform to the established cross
 section.
 307.03.4--Application of Lime. The rate of application of lime shall be as specified. The
 first application for Class A treatment shall not be made after October 15, and no lime
 shall be applied between November 1 and March 1 without written authorization from the
 Engineer.
 Lime shall not be applied unless the temperature in the shade is at least 40°F and is
 expected to remain at least 40°F during the mixing period. In no case shall lime be
 applied on a frozen foundation.
 Application of lime shall be accomplished by either an approved "dry application" or
 "slurry application" method.
 The following guide lines will govern the acceptability of the method to be used:
 Dry Application. Lime applied by this method shall be spread uniformly and shall
 be sprinkled with sufficient water to prevent loss of lime by wind. Spreading of lime
 when wind and weather conditions are unfavorable will not be permitted nor will
 spreading of lime by motor patrol be acceptable.
 The Department reserves the right to check, at any time, the dispersion of quick lime
 dust in the atmosphere. At no time shall the atmosphere dispersion of quick lime
 dust exceed a rate of 30,000 µg/m3, measured at a distance of 100 feet.
 Slurry Application. Lime applied by this method shall be mixed with water in
 approved agitation equipment and applied to the roadbed as a thin water suspension
 or slurry. The distributing equipment shall be equipped to provide continuous
 agitation of the slurry until applied on the roadbed. The proportion of lime shall be
 such that the "Dry Solids Content" shall be at least 30 percent by weight.
 
 203
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 The distribution of lime at the rate specified shall be attained by one or more passes over
 a measured section until the specified percentage of lime has been spread. After each
 successive pass the material shall be incorporated into the soil with the mixing
 equipment. Additional water, if necessary, shall be added and mixed into the mass to
 hasten mellowing.
 Payment will not be made for lime that has been spread and exposed for a period of six
 hours or more before mixing. Such areas shall be treated again with the full required rate
 of application.
 Additional lime shall be added at the Contractor's expense to any section on which
 excessive lime loss has occurred due to washing or blowing, prior to mixing.
 The quantity of lime applied on a section shall be spread uniformly and shall not vary
 more than plus or minus five percent of the quantity ordered. No payment will be made
 for lime application exceeding the five percent plus tolerance. When the quantity applied
 is deficient by more than five percent, additional lime shall be applied prior to mixing.
 307.03.5--Mixing.
 307.03.5.1--Initial Mixing. For Class A and Class B treatments, the lime and water shall
 be incorporated uniformly into the soil. The mixing and watering operation shall be
 continued until a homogeneous mixture that will pass a three-inch sieve is obtained.
 After satisfactory mixing is obtained, the layer shall be reshaped to line, grade, and
 section and sealed with a light roller no later than the next day following mixing. The
 sealed mixture shall then mellow for the period specified in the lime mix design furnished
 by the Central Laboratory. The mellowing period will be measured in degree days. This
 period will not be less than five (5) nor more than 20 calendar days. The temperature to
 be used to determine the degree days mellowing period will be the average of the high
 and low temperatures for each day of the mellowing period. In the event the average is
 40°F or less, that day will not be used in computing the degree days mellowing period.
 The recommended degree days for the mellowing period may be reduced by the Engineer
 provided pulverization during final mixing is documented by sieve analysis.
 During the mellowing period the partially treated course or layer shall be kept moist by
 sprinkling. All sections on which the surface becomes dry during the mellowing period
 shall be reprocessed to the satisfaction of the Engineer or reconstructed in accordance
 with these specifications.
 For Class C treatment, the lime and water shall be incorporated uniformly into the soil.
 The mixing and water application shall be continued until a homogeneous mixture of
 which 100 percent of the material by dry weight, exclusive of gravel and stone, will pass
 a 1-inch sieve and 60 percent will pass a No. 4 sieve. At the completion of moist mixing
 and during the compaction operations, the percentage of moisture shall be that necessary
 to obtain the required density. No mellowing period will be required or permitted, and
 compaction shall begin immediately. The mixing, water application, and final
 compaction shall be completed during the same work day.
 307.03.5.2--Final Mixing. After the mellowing period of Classes A and B treatments,
 the layer shall be scarified and, in the case of Class A treatment, the second application of
 
 204
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 lime added. The layer shall then be remixed as prescribed in the initial mixing
 operations. Mixing shall continue until 100 percent of material by dry weight, exclusive
 of gravel and stone, will pass a 1-inch sieve and 60 percent will pass a No. 4 sieve. At
 the end of mixing and during compaction, the moisture in the mixture shall be that
 necessary to obtain the required density.
 307.03.5.3--Thickness and Width Requirements. For the purpose of determining
 reasonable conformity with the designated thickness of a course, it shall be understood
 that the depth of a course shall not vary from the designated thickness by more than plus
 or minus one inch. All sections not in reasonably close conformity because of deficient
 thickness shall be reprocessed to meet specification requirements. All sections not in
 reasonably close conformity because of excess thickness shall have additional lime
 applied and shall be reprocessed to meet specification requirements at no additional cost
 to the State.
 For the purpose of determining reasonable conformity with the designated width of a
 course, it shall be understood that the width of a course shall not vary from the designated
 edge lines by more than plus or minus three inches.
 307.03.6--Compaction. Compaction of the mixture shall begin immediately after the
 required mixing operation has been completed.
 Compaction shall be completed during same day it was begun and shall provide uniform
 and continuous compaction from bottom to top of the layer. The mixture shall be aerated
 or watered as necessary to provide the needed moisture content for obtaining the required
 density.
 Throughout the entire compaction operation, depressions, defective areas, and soft spots
 that develop shall be corrected immediately by scarifying the area, adding lime when
 required, or removing the material, and reshaping and compacting in accordance with
 these specifications at no additional cost to the State.
 Density tests will be performed in accordance with the methods as provided in
 Subsections 700.03 and 700.04.
 Determination of acceptance of compaction of Classes A, B, and C lime treated design
 soil will be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be 2,500 linear feet per layer
 placed. At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of a lot completed during a
 day's operation may be considered as a separate lot or may be included in the previous or
 subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than one full lot will be considered
 a lot.
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The average of the five density tests shall equal or exceed 95.0
 percent with no single density test below 91.0 percent. Sublots with a density below 91.0
 percent shall be corrected at no additional cost to the State and retested for acceptance.
 307.03.7--Finishing, Curing, Protection, and Maintaining. The surface of the layer
 shall be smooth and conform to the lines, grades, and typical cross sections shown on the
 plans or established by the Engineer. Surface requirements shall be as specified in
 Subsection 321.03.7.
 
 205
 
 Section 307
 
 Section 307
 
 Each complete course shall be covered with a bituminous curing seal as soon as possible
 but no later than 24 hours after completion. The surface shall be sealed with one of the
 specified bituminous materials applied by a pressure distributor at the rate of 0.10 to 0.25
 gallon per square yard or as directed by the Engineer. The bituminous material shall be
 heated or otherwise prepared to ensure uniform distribution. Should the Contractor fail to
 seal the treated course within the time specified, the Engineer will suspend all other work
 and withhold payment of the current estimate(s) until all damages resulting there from is
 corrected and the treated course is sealed.
 A subsequent course shall not be placed on the sealed course for at least seven (7)
 calendar days. During this 7-day period, the treated course shall not be subjected to any
 type of traffic and equipment.
 The Contractor shall maintain the treated course and the curing seal in a satisfactory
 condition until covered by a subsequent course. Protection shall include immediate
 repairs of any surface irregularities or other defects that may occur or develop. It shall be
 the Contractor's responsibility to control traffic and equipment loads to avoid damage and
 to guard against freezing of the treated material.
 All damage resulting from the Contractor's failure to protect and cure the treated course
 as specified herein or from freezing that may occur prior to being covered with the next
 course shall be corrected at no additional cost to the State.
 Lime treated courses shall be corrected by reprocessing with Class C treatment to such
 depth as necessary to restore the CBR (California Bearing Ratio) of the damaged material
 to that shown on the mix design, all at no additional cost to the State. The Contractor
 shall add the necessary quantity of lime, as determined by the Central Laboratory, and in
 no case shall it be less than two percent by weight.
 307.04--Method of Measurement. Soil-lime-water mixing will be measured by the
 square yard, complete in place, for each course designated on the plans and for which
 quantities have been included in the contract.
 If a change in the class of treatment is made, as provided in Subsection 307.0l, each class
 of treatment constructed will be measured separately.
 Lime incorporated in accepted treatment will be measured by the ton. Lime in excess of
 the tolerance allowable and all lime required to be furnished by the Contractor at no
 additional cost to the State will be deducted from measured quantities.
 The basis of pay for jobsite slaked lime slurry shall be the "calculated method" using the
 certified lime purity for each truckload as follows:
 Pure Quick Lime (Ca O) x 1.32 = Hydrated Lime (Ca (OH)2)
 Quick Lime delivered x % purity X 1.32 = A
 Quick Lime delivered x % inert material x 1.0 = B
 A + B = Total Hydrated Lime produced (Pay Quantity)

 QUICK LIME DELIVERED X % INERT MATERIAL X 1.0 = B
 A + B = Total Hydrated Lime produced (Pay Quantity)
 Bituminous curing seal will be measured by the gallon as prescribed in Subsection
 109.01. Unless otherwise specified, distributor tank measurements will be used. The
 volume of material over five percent above the allowed range for each shot will be
 deducted from measured quantities, except that 15 percent will be allowed for irregular
 areas where hand spraying is necessary. The volume of all bituminous material lost,
 wasted, damaged, or rejected, or applied outside of designated areas, or in excess of the
 Engineer's directions and tolerances allowed, or contrary to the specifications, will be
 deducted from measured quantities.
 Water will not be measured for separate payment.

 the Central Laboratory.
 308.03--Construction Requirements.
 308.03.1--General. The intent of these specifications is to provide for a cement treated
 course of designated thickness consisting of a uniform mixture of cement, soil or soil
 aggregate, and water; constructed at the required moisture content to the required density;
 free of laminations, construction cracks, ridges, or loose material; and with a smooth,
 closely knit surface meeting the requirements set out in Section 321.
 A course whose compacted thickness is designated to be more than eight inches, shall be
 constructed in two or more layers of approximately equal thickness. The maximum
 compacted thickness of any one layer shall not exceed eight inches.
 Immediately prior to placement of a course to be cement treated on an in place cement
 treated course, the in place course shall be thoroughly moistened.
 Except as necessary to provide the required curing and maintenance of traffic, all
 equipment and traffic shall be kept off each completed cement treated course until it is
 thoroughly cured. Unless otherwise specified, the curing period shall be seven days
 exclusive of days during which the temperature falls below 35°F.
 Prior to joining a previous day's work, or work more than two hours old, a vertical
 construction joint, normal to the centerline of the roadbed, shall be made in the old work.
 The joint shall be moistened if dry. Additional processing shall not be started until the
 construction joint has been approved by the Engineer.
 When vertical longitudinal joints are specified or permitted, the joints shall be
 constructed parallel to the centerline by cutting into the existing edge for a sufficient
 distance to provide a vertical face for the depth of the course. The material cut away may
 
 209
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 be disposed of by spreading in a thin layer on the adjacent lane to be constructed, or
 otherwise disposed of in a satisfactory manner. If dry, cut joints shall be moistened
 immediately in advance of placing fresh mixture adjacent to them.
 On multi-lane construction, the Contractor may construct temporary crossovers at
 locations approved by the Engineer between roadway lanes to facilitate construction
 operations. The crossovers shall be built, removed, the median restored to section, and
 all erosion control items completed in accordance with the requirements of the
 specifications without extra cost to the State.
 The first section of each cement treated course constructed will serve as a test section.
 The length of the test section will be determined by the capability of the equipment
 provided to perform the work, but not less than 350 linear feet nor more than 500 linear
 feet for the designated width. The Engineer and the Contractor will evaluate results of
 the test section in relation to contract requirements. In case the Engineer determines the
 work is not satisfactory, the Contractor shall revise procedures and augment or replace
 equipment as necessary to assure work completed in accordance with the contract, and
 shall correct all deficient work at no additional cost to the State.
 308.03.2--Equipment.
 308.03.2.1--General. Equipment necessary for the proper prosecution of the work shall
 be on the project and approved by the Engineer prior to its use.
 Approval of cement spreaders will be contingent upon their known or demonstrated
 ability to make distribution of cement within allowable tolerances.
 Watering equipment shall be pressurized, have one or more spray bars with suitable
 nozzle openings, and have positive controls for applying varying quantities of water.
 Mixing shall be performed with multiple pass mixers, single pass mixers, traveling
 mixing plants, or central mixing plants, as specified in the contract.
 Mixing and scarifying equipment for the road mix methods shall be capable of positive
 depth control.
 Rollers shall be of sufficient number, type, size, and weight to accomplish the required
 compaction.

 corrected, or the leaking equipment removed from the work and replaced with
 satisfactory equipment.
 308.03.2.2--Multiple Pass Mixers. Multiple pass mixers shall be the rotary-type with
 sufficient tines and so constructed and operable as to obtain by multiple passes uniform
 mixture of the cement, soil-aggregate, and water for the full depth of the course.
 308.03.2.3--Single Pass Mixers. Single pass mixers shall be the pugmill type so
 constructed and operable as to meter the required quantity of water through a pressurized
 spray and obtain by a single pass a uniform mixture of the cement, soil or soil-aggregate,
 and water for the full depth of the course.
 
 210
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 308.03.2.4--Traveling Plant Mixers. Traveling mixing plants shall be either of the type
 that will pulverize the material to be treated and mix it and cement with the proper
 quantity of water without picking the materials up from the roadway, or of the pugmill
 type that elevates the materials into a pugmill for mixing. The plant shall be equipped
 with a device that will accurately control and measure the quantity of water used. Worn
 scarifying and mixing parts shall be replaced, and extra parts shall be available for
 replacements.
 308.03.2.5--Central Plant Mixers. Central mixing plants shall be either the batch type
 using revolving blade or rotary drum mixers or the continuous mixing type. The cement,
 soil or soil-aggregate, and water may be proportioned either by weight or by volume.
 There shall be means by which the Engineer can readily verify the proportions in each
 batch or the rate of flow for continuous mixing.
 The charge and mixing time in a batch mixer, or the rate of feed to a continuous mixer,
 shall be such as to obtain complete mixing of all the material. Dead areas in the mixer, in
 which the material does not move or is not sufficiently agitated, shall be corrected. The
 plant shall deliver a uniform mixture meeting all specified requirements.
 308.03.3--Road Mix Method. When the road mix method is used, no hauling of
 materials for a subsequent course will be permitted directly on a completed cement
 treated course. Placing of material for a higher course shall be accomplished as outlined
 in Subsection 321.03. Materials for a higher course shall be kept bladed down as it is
 placed, and hauled over with truck traffic being distributed over its entire width.
 Where reconstruction is required, it shall be for the full depth and width of the deficient
 section. The adding of a thin layer or strip of cement treated material will not be
 permitted. All sections to be reconstructed later than the two-hour period allowed for
 initial compaction shall have additional cement. When reconstruction is to be performed
 within 48 hours after the initial application of cement, 50 percent of the original quantity
 of cement shall be added. When reconstruction is to be later than 48 hours after the
 initial application of cement, an engineering study will be made, and the Engineer will
 specify the additional quantity of cement to be added, or the Engineer may require the
 total removal of the deficient work. If removal is required, a course meeting the
 requirements of the contract shall be constructed with new materials.
 In all cases where reconstruction is performed by the addition of cement, the cement, in
 place materials, and water shall be thoroughly mixed, processed, compacted, and finished
 in accordance with the requirements of the contract.
 Where deficient work is removed, the removal and disposal shall be performed in a
 manner satisfactory to the Engineer, and all materials shall be replaced and a new course
 constructed in accordance with the requirements of the contract.
 The furnishing of all materials for and all reconstruction shall be performed by the
 Contractor at no additional cost to the State.
 308.03.4--Central Plant Mix Method. When the central plant mix method is used,
 material for a higher course may be hauled directly on a completed and properly cured
 cement treated course for the minimum distance necessary as referenced in Subsection
 
 211
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 321.03. The Contractor shall be fully responsible for all damages to the course.
 Prior to placement of a course processed by the plant mix method, the Contractor shall
 have made satisfactory provisions for completing the section to specified requirements.
 To comply with these requirements, the Contractor shall, if necessary, use material(s)
 specified for contiguous shoulder construction.
 The mixture shall be hauled to the roadway in trucks equipped with protective covers.
 The mixture shall be uniformly placed on a moistened foundation by full-width spreader,
 or partial-width spreaders working in echelon and spaced close enough together to place
 the entire course in one operation. The elapsed time between the start of moist mixing
 and the start of compaction on the roadway shall not exceed 60 minutes. The elapsed
 time between placement of cement treated material in adjacent lanes shall not exceed 30
 minutes, except where longitudinal construction joints are specified, or when joints are
 permitted by the Engineer in case of emergency. In the latter case longitudinal joints
 conforming to the requirements of these specifications will be permitted only to allow
 placement of material in transit at the time of the emergency.
 The material shall be placed, shaped, and compacted so that the completed course will be
 uniform, smooth, and conform to all of the requirements specified.
 Dumping of the mixture in piles or windrows and spreading with a motor grader or
 similar equipment will not be permitted except where the Engineer determines that such
 spreading is reasonable, as in the case of small areas inaccessible to mechanical
 spreaders.
 In all cases where reconstruction is required, the deficient work shall be removed,
 disposed of, and replaced with materials meeting the requirements of these specifications.
 Reconstruction shall be for the full depth and width of the deficient section, except where
 the Engineer determines that partial reconstruction will be sufficient, the Engineer may
 authorize in writing that reconstruction may be made on the defined partial section in
 accordance with the provisions and requirements for reconstruction under Subsection
 308.03.3 at no additional cost to the State.
 308.03.5--Preparation of Grade. Prior to construction or reconstruction, the foundation
 shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 321. The tolerance
 from design grade immediately prior to spreading cement shall be minus one inch for
 design soils and plus or minus one-half inch for bases.
 308.03.6--Preparation of Materials. Particles of aggregates larger than those passing a
 three-inch sieve and deleterious substances, such as roots, sticks, grass turfs, or other
 vegetable matter shall be removed.
 308.03.7--Application of Cement.
 308.03.7.1--General. The percentages of cement shown on the plans are based on
 preliminary soil investigation and are approximate. Before construction is started, the
 Department will make the necessary tests to determine the percentages of cement
 required.
 The quantity of cement spread on a section or added through a central plant shall not vary
 
 212
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 more than five percent of the quantity ordered. When the quantity spread is deficient by
 more than five percent, an additional application of cement shall be uniformly spread
 over the entire section to correct the deficiency prior to mixing operation. Cement,
 including that applied to correct deficiency, in excess of the allowable plus tolerance will
 be deducted from measured quantities.
 When the quantity of cement added through a central plant is deficient by more than the
 allowable tolerance, all mixtures produced with deficient cement will be considered
 unacceptable.
 When the quantity of cement added through a central plant is in excess of the allowable
 tolerance, the excess will be computed by the Engineer and deducted from measured
 quantities.
 308.03.7.2--Weather Limitations. No cement or cement treated material shall be
 applied or placed when the temperature is below 40°F nor when the Engineer determines,
 based on the latest information available from the National Weather Service, that the
 forecast temperature will fall below 40°F within the next three (3) days in the area in
 which the project is located. For anticipated mixing operations on a Monday, a Friday
 forecast that runs through the following Wednesday shall be used to determine if
 conditions will allow the application of cement on Monday. No cement or cement treated
 material shall be placed on a frozen foundation or mixed with frozen material.
 308.03.7.3--Road Mix Method. After preparation of the grade, the required quantity of
 cement shall be spread uniformly over the grade. Cement lost or damaged from any
 cause shall be replaced without additional compensation before mixing is started.
 The cement spreader shall be positioned by string lines or other approved methods during
 spreading to ensure proper application of cement. All cement deposited into the spreader
 shall be weighed so that the pay quantity and the rate of spread can be determined.
 In small areas, bag distribution in an approved manner will be permitted. When bag
 distribution is made, a spike-toothed harrow or other equipment, that will not drag or
 blade the cement out of desired position but will strike it off at a uniform height, may be
 used. A motor grader, or other blade-type equipment, shall not be used to spread the
 cement.
 Except for final finishing, all processing shall be completed within three hours after
 spreading. Except by written permission of the Engineer, no cement shall be spread on
 an area that cannot be completely processed, including all final surface finishing, during
 the same day.
 No cement shall be applied when the moisture content of the material to be processed
 exceeds the optimum for the soil-cement mixture by more than two percentage points.
 No cement shall be spread when free water is on the surface of the roadbed.
 No equipment except that used in spreading or mixing shall be allowed to pass over the
 freshly spread cement until mixed with the material to be treated.
 308.03.7.4--Central Plant Mix Method. The cement shall be uniformly metered into
 the soil or soil-aggregate in the specified proportions and at the time and in the manner
 
 213
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 that the application of water will not cause formation of cement balls.
 308.03.8--Mixing.
 308.03.8.1--General. Unless otherwise indicated, cement treated materials may be
 processed by any one or combination of the mixing equipment described in Subsection
 308.03.2. Where the bid schedule indicates single pass mixers, traveling plant mixers or
 central plant mixers will also be permitted. Where the bid schedule indicates traveling
 plant mixers, central plant mixers will also be permitted.
 Preliminary scarifying shall be carefully controlled and the undisturbed foundation shall
 have a crown conforming as nearly as practicable to that of the finished course. Subject
 to the moisture limitations prior to spreading cement as referenced in Subsection
 308.03.7.3, soil to be processed may be pre-wet prior to spreading cement. All additional
 water required to bring the section being processed to the required moisture content shall
 be applied within one hour after the beginning of mixing.
 Mixing shall be carefully controlled so that the bottom of the course will conform as
 closely as possible to the design grade and cross section.
 When the plans indicate multiple courses to be constructed, the material for each course
 shall be mixed separately. Multiple courses shall be constructed so that each course is in
 direct contact with the underlying course, and an unmixed cushion of material between
 layers will not be permitted.
 Each increment of water added during mixing shall be incorporated into the mixture for
 the full depth, and no portion of the mixture shall remain undisturbed for more than 30
 minutes prior to compaction. Mixing and water application shall be continued as
 necessary to produce a completed mixture of uniform moisture content. Particular care
 shall be exercised to ensure satisfactory moisture distribution along the edges of the
 section, and to avoid the addition of excess water.
 The soil-cement mixture for subgrade and base construction shall be pulverized to the
 extent that 100 percent of the material, exclusive of gravel and stone, by dry weight will
 pass a 1-inch sieve and a minimum of 75 percent will pass a No. 4 sieve.
 The soil-cement mixture for design soils shall be pulverized to the extent that 100 percent
 of the material, exclusive of gravel and stone, by dry weight will pass a 1-inch sieve and
 a minimum of 60 percent will pass No. 4 sieve.
 When the un-compacted mixture is wetted by rain to the extent the average moisture
 content at the time for final compaction exceeds optimum by more than two percent, or if
 any of the operations after the start of mixing are interrupted continuously for more than
 30 minutes, the entire area affected shall be reconstructed in accordance with these
 specifications at no additional cost to the State.
 308.03.8.2--Road Mix Methods.
 308.03.8.2.1--Multiple Pass Mixing. After the cement has been spread, it shall be mixed
 with the material to be treated without the addition of water. Immediately after the
 preliminary mixing of cement and soil or soil-aggregate, water as necessary shall be
 
 214
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 applied in the quantity required and incorporated uniformly into the mixture for the full
 depth.
 After the last increment of water has been applied, mixing shall continue as necessary
 until a uniform mixture of cement, soil or soil-aggregate, and water for the full depth of
 the course has been obtained.
 308.03.8.2.2--Single Pass Mixing. After the cement has been spread, it shall be mixed
 by a mixer that applies water and mixes in one simultaneous and continuous operation.
 The mixer shall be operated at a speed that will produce a uniform mixture meeting all
 specified requirements for the full depth of the course.
 308.03.8.2.3--Traveling Plant Mixing. After the cement has been spread, it shall be
 mixed with a traveling plant mixer that will apply the proper quantity of water and
 produce in one simultaneous and continuous operation a mixture meeting all the
 requirements of the contract.
 308.03.8.3--Central Plant Method. Mixing in a central plant shall continue until a
 homogeneous mixture meeting specified requirements is obtained, and no varying
 appearance is evident. The mixing time may be adjusted by the Engineer as necessary.
 308.03.9--Shaping, Compacting, and Finishing.
 308.03.9.1--General. The mixed material shall be shaped as required immediately after
 mixing, or delivery to the roadbed in the case of central plant mixed material. Initial
 compaction shall begin immediately, and machining and compacting shall continue until
 the entire depth and width of the course is compacted to the required density within two
 hours of the time of beginning mixing. Compaction shall be by equipment and methods
 that do not result in lamination.
 Areas inaccessible to rollers shall be compacted to the required density by other approved
 methods.
 The addition of thin layers of cement-treated material in order to conform to cross
 sectional or grade requirements will not be permitted.
 Compaction by vibration shall not be performed after the cement has taken its initial set.
 Vibratory compaction of a section shall be completed within one hour.
 During compaction, a spike-tooth harrow or other suitable equipment shall be used as
 required to prevent lamination.
 After the mixture, except the top mulch, is compacted, water shall be added as required to
 the mulch, and thoroughly mixed with a spike-tooth harrow or its equivalent to bring the
 mulch to the needed moisture content.
 The surface shall then be reshaped to the required lines, grades, and cross section, and if
 necessary shall be lightly scarified to remove imprints left by the compacting or shaping
 equipment. The surface shall then be sprinkled as necessary and thoroughly rolled with a
 pneumatic roller, and if the mixture contains plus No. 4 aggregate, at least one complete
 coverage of the section shall be made with a steel-wheel tandem roller.
 
 215
 
 Section 308
 
 Section 308
 
 Surface compaction and finishing for the entire section shall be performed in a manner
 that will produce a smooth, closely knit surface, free from laminations, construction
 cracks, ridges, or loose material, and conforming to the crown, grade, and lines stipulated
 within four hours after the beginning of mixing.
 Upon completion of compaction, testing will be performed in accordance with
 Subsections 700.03 and 700.04.
 308.03.9.2--Density. Determination of acceptance of compaction of cement treated
 courses for required density will be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be each
 2,500 linear feet per layer placed. At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of
 a lot completed during a day's operation may be considered a separate lot or may be
 included in the previous or subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than
 one full lot will be considered a lot.
 Soil Cement Treatment of Subgrade. The lot will be divided into five approximately
 equal sublots with one density test taken at random in each sublot. The average of the
 five (5) density tests shall equal or exceed 96.0 percent with no single density test below
 94.0 percent. Sublots with a density below 94.0 percent shall be corrected at no
 additional cost to the State and retested for acceptance.
 Each lot of work found not to meet the density requirement of 96.0% of maximum
 density, may remain in place with a reduction in payment as set out in the following
 table:

 Soil Cement Treatment of Irregular Areas. Density of irregular areas shall be rolled to
 highest stability. Irregular areas shall be defined as pre-leveling, wedging [less than fifty
 percent (50%) of width greater than minimum lift thickness], ramp pads, irregular
 shoulder areas, median crossovers, turnouts, and other areas where an established rolling
 pattern cannot be obtained.
 For cement treated materials other than for design soils and bases, the required density
 will be set out elsewhere in the contract.
 308.03.9.3--Width, Thickness, and Surface Requirements. For the purpose of
 determining reasonable conformity with the designated width of a treated course, it shall
 be understood that the width of a treated course shall not vary from the designated edge
 lines by more than plus or minus one inch.
 For the purpose of determining reasonable conformance with the designated thickness of
 a treated course, it shall be understood that the depth of a treated course shall not vary
 from the designated thickness by more than plus or minus one inch.
 The finished surface of a treated course shall conform to the requirements shown on the
 plans, within the tolerances allowable under Section 321.
 308.03.10--Protection and Curing. Each completed course shall be covered with a
 bituminous curing seal as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after completion.
 The surface shall be sealed with one of the specified bituminous materials applied by a
 pressure distributor at the rate of 0.10 to 0.25 gallon per square yard or as directed by the
 Engineer. The bituminous material shall be heated or otherwise prepared to ensure
 uniform distribution. Should the Contractor fail to seal the treated course within the time
 specified, the Engineer will suspend all other work and withhold payment of the current
 estimate(s) until all damages resulting there from is corrected and the treated course is
 sealed.
 When the treated course is the subgrade, a subsequent course shall not be placed on the
 sealed course for at least seven (7) calendar days. During this 7-day period, the treated
 course shall not be subjected to any type of traffic and equipment.
 
 217

 least seven (7) or fourteen (14) calendar days. During this period, the treated course shall
 not be subjected to any type of traffic and equipment.
 The Contractor shall maintain the treated course and the curing seal in a satisfactory
 condition until covered by a subsequent course. Protection shall include immediate
 repairs of any surface irregularities or other defects that may occur or develop. It shall be
 the Contractor's responsibility to control traffic and equipment loads to avoid damage and
 to guard against freezing of the treated material.
 All damage resulting from the Contractor's failure to protect and cure the treated course
 as specified herein or from freezing that may occur prior to being covered with the next
 course shall be corrected at no additional cost to the State.
 The Contractor shall submit, for approval of the Engineer, a method of correction that
 will restore the strength of the damaged material to that originally specified.
 308.03.11--Maintenance. The Contractor shall maintain the cement treated course and
 the curing seal in a satisfactory condition until covered by a subsequent course.
 Maintenance shall include immediate repairs of surface irregularities or other defects that
 may occur. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to control traffic and equipment
 loads to avoid damage and to guard against freezing of the course. All maintenance shall
 be performed at the expense of the Contractor and repeated as necessary to keep the
 cement treated material and the curing seal intact.
 308.04--Method of Measurement. Cement incorporated in the accepted work, subject
 to the limitations set out in Subsection 308.03.7.1, will be measured by the ton, as
 designated, in accordance with the provisions of Section 109.
 Accepted soil-cement-water mixing will be measured by the square yard or ton.
 Contractor furnished materials will be measured and paid for in accordance with the
 provisions for the governing pay items shown in the contract.
 Bituminous curing seal will be measured by the gallon as prescribed in Subsection
 109.01. Unless otherwise specified, distributor tank measurements will be used. The
 volume of material over five percent above the allowed range for each shot will be
 deducted from measured quantities, except that 15 percent will be allowed for irregular
 areas where hand spraying is necessary. The volume of all bituminous material lost,

 SECTION 310 - MECHANICALLY STABILIZED COURSES
 310.01--Description. This work consists of constructing one or more courses by the
 incorporation of stabilizer aggregate in accordance with these specifications and in
 reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, and typical cross sections shown on
 the plans or established by the Engineer.
 310.02--Materials.
 310.02.1--Materials to be Stabilized. The material to be stabilized shall consist of base
 material placed under this contract or under a previous contract.
 General conditions governing the use of materials shall be as set out in Section 106.
 310.02.2--Stabilizer Aggregates. Stabilizer aggregates of the kind and size specified
 shall meet the requirements of Subsection 703.20.
 310.02.3--Composite Mixture. The composite mixture of mechanically stabilized
 courses shall be in accordance with the requirements and provisions of Subsection
 703.08. In order to obtain the desirable composite mixture, the Engineer may vary the
 quantity of stabilizer aggregate shown on the plans by as much as 25 percent.
 Acceptance of the composite mixture for conformance to the specification requirements
 for gradation, liquid limit and plasticity index shall be based on samples obtained from
 the roadway. A minimum of one random sample shall be obtained for each 1000 linear
 
 219
 
 Section 310
 
 Section 310
 
 feet of 24 foot lane. In case a sample fails to meet the requirements of the specifications,
 additional samples shall be obtained to locate the limits of the non-conforming material.
 Such non-conforming material shall be corrected by the Contractor, at no additional costs
 to the State, prior to final acceptance.
 310.03--Construction Requirements.
 310.03.1--General. The first section of each course to be constructed will serve as a test
 section. The length of the test section will be determined by the capability of the
 equipment selected to perform the work, but will be at least 1000 linear feet but not more
 than 1500 linear feet for the designated width. The Engineer and the Contractor will
 evaluate results of the test section in relation to contract requirements. In case the
 Engineer determines the work is not satisfactory, the Contractor shall revise procedures
 and augment or replace equipment as necessary to assure work is completed in
 accordance with the contract, and shall correct all deficient work at no additional cost to
 the State.
 For the purpose of determining reasonable conformity with the designated width of a
 course, the width of a course shall not vary from the designated edge lines by more than
 plus or minus three inches.
 Courses designated to be more than eight inches thick shall be constructed in two or more
 layers of approximately equal thickness. The maximum compacted thickness of any one
 layer shall not exceed eight inches.
 When the plans indicate multiple courses, each course shall be mixed or spread, shaped,
 and compacted separately. Multiple courses shall be constructed so that each course is in
 direct contact with the preceding course, and a cushion of un-stabilized material between
 layers will not be permitted.
 When material for shoulders is of a different class or type from that specified for the
 course being constructed, the partial formation of shoulders shall precede the placement
 of aggregate or plant mixed material. Temporary drainage as necessary through partially
 constructed shoulders shall be provided and maintained until construction of the
 contiguous course.
 No material shall be placed on or mixed with frozen material.
 310.03.2--Equipment. Watering equipment shall have pressurized spray bars with
 suitable nozzle openings.

 Section 310
 
 approved platform scales capable of weighing the entire loaded vehicle. Scales and their
 use shall be in accordance with the requirements set out in Subsection 401.03.2.1.11,
 except they shall be installed at an approved location on or near the project.
 310.03.3--Preparation of Grade. Prior to placing material, the foundation shall be
 prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 321 for a sufficient distance in
 advance to ensure proper prosecution of the work.
 310.03.4--Preparation of Materials. The material to be stabilized shall be reasonably
 free from clay balls, roots, grass, organic matter, and other deleterious substances.
 310.03.5--Application of Stabilizer Aggregate (Road Mix Method). When the
 roadbed has been prepared and approved, aggregate in the quantity specified shall be
 uniformly spread.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient equipment and shall organize the work so that the
 time interval between dumping and spreading of aggregate and subsequent incorporation
 shall be the minimum necessary to carry on an efficient and continuous operation.
 Dumping of long lines of aggregate on the roadbed and prolonged periods of hauling
 adjacent thereto will not be permitted. Unless prevented by unavoidable conditions,
 aggregate shall be incorporated, mixed, shaped, compacted, and finished not later than
 the second day following delivery to the roadbed.
 310.03.6--Mixing.
 310.03.6.1--General. During the mixing operations, clay balls and other undesirable
 materials present in sufficient quantity to impair the quality of the course shall be
 removed.
 310.03.6.2--Road Mix Method. After the stabilizer aggregate has been uniformly
 spread, the material shall be scarified, if necessary, and the mixing operation begun
 immediately.
 All preliminary scarifying and mixing shall be carefully controlled to provide an
 undisturbed foundation course with the designated grade and cross section.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for damage to or contamination with the underlying
 material or shoulder material, and shall make corrections and repairs as necessary at no
 additional cost to the State.
 All material to be stabilized shall be thoroughly mixed and pulverized by incorporating
 the added materials so that the course will be homogeneous throughout. During the
 mixing operation, water shall be applied as necessary to provide the needed moisture
 content for obtaining the required density.
 Particular care shall be exercised to ensure satisfactory moisture distribution along the
 edges of the course, and to avoid the application of excess water on any portion of a
 section.
 310.03.6.3--Central Plant Method. Water shall be added during the mixing operation in
 the quantity necessary to provide the needed moisture content. Mixing shall continue
 
 221
 
 Section 310
 
 Section 310
 
 until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. After the mixing is complete, the mixture shall
 be transported while at the proper moisture content for compaction, and shall be placed
 on the prepared grade by means of an aggregate spreader.
 The Contractor shall deliver to the roadbed a sufficient quantity of mixed material to
 produce the designated course. All material placed in excess of the tolerances allowable
 in Section 321 shall be removed and hauled from the project without compensation, or
 removed and placed at other approved locations requiring use of the same material.
 310.03.7--Spreading, Compacting, and Finishing. The mixed material shall be spread
 immediately after mixing, or after delivery in the case of central plant mixed material.
 Spreading shall be carried out in a manner that will minimize segregation and will result
 in a completed course within the tolerances allowable.
 Compaction shall start longitudinally at the outer edges of the course and proceed toward
 the center. The material shall be sprinkled or aerated as necessary during compaction to
 maintain the needed moisture content.
 Shaping and compaction shall be carried out in such a manner as to prevent lamination
 and shall continue until the entire depth and width of the course has obtained the required
 density. Throughout the entire compaction operation, the shape of the course shall be
 maintained by blading and rolling. Surface compaction and finishing shall be performed
 so as to produce a smooth, closely knit surface, free from lamination, cracks, ridges, or
 loose material, and conforming to the required section and the established lines and
 grades within the tolerances allowable.
 Prior to subsequent construction, all irregularities, depressions, soft spots, and other
 deficiencies shall be corrected to meet the requirements of these specifications at no
 additional cost to the State.
 After compaction and finishing, if the mixture contains plus No. 4 aggregate and the
 course is to serve as a base for bituminous pavement, at least one complete coverage shall
 be made with a steel wheel roller. The Engineer may waive this requirement for shell
 stabilized bases.
 In addition to the requirements for density and correction of irregularities, depressions, or
 soft spots, the Contractor shall be fully responsible for constructing and maintaining a
 course that will remain firm and stable under all construction equipment and other traffic
 that the course is subjected prior to the acceptance of the work.
 Density tests will be performed in accordance with the methods as provided in
 Subsections 700.03 and 700.04.
 Determination of acceptance of compaction of mechanically stabilized courses for
 required density will be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be each 2,500 linear
 feet per layer placed. At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of a lot
 completed during a day's operation may be considered a separate lot or may be included
 in the previous or the subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than one full
 lot will be considered a lot.
 
 222
 
 Section 310
 
 Section 310
 
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The individual tests and the average of the five tests shall equal
 or exceed the values as shown in the table below. For any course that is to be
 subsequently chemically treated, the average of the five density tests shall equal or
 exceed 93.0 percent with no single density test below 89.0 percent.

 The finished surface of all courses shall conform to the required section and the
 established lines and grades, within the tolerances allowable under Section 321. All
 finished courses shall be continually maintained until covered by a subsequent course or
 the work released from maintenance.
 310.04--Method of Measurement. Mixing, shaping, and compaction will be measured
 by the square yard, station, or mile, as designated, for each course included in the
 contract.
 Stabilizer aggregate will be measured by the cubic yard (LVM) or by the ton, as
 designated in the bid schedule of the contract. Other materials (except water) specified
 and incorporated into accepted work will be measured and paid for under the provisions
 of the governing pay items shown in the contract. When the method of measurement is
 by the ton, measurement will be made on the dry unit weight basis at the point of
 weighing. The moisture determination for computing the dry unit weight will be made in
 accordance with the methods set out in Subsection 700.03 at least one time each day, and
 as many additional times as the Engineer deems necessary. Water will not be measured
 for payment.
 Unauthorized wastage or usage of materials, unused materials remaining in stockpiles,
 and additional materials required for correction of unacceptable work will be deducted
 from measured quantities. Determination of quantities to be deducted will be made by
 the method the Engineer considers to be most practicable and equitable, and the
 Engineer’s decision as to the method used for such computations shall be final.
 310.05--Basis of Payment. Mixing, shaping, and compaction will be paid for at the
 contract unit price per specified unit. Stabilizer aggregates will be paid for at the contract
 unit price per specified unit. The prices thus paid shall be full compensation for

 311.02.1--Soil-Lime-Fly Ash Design. Quantities and percentages of lime and fly ash
 shown on the plans are preliminary. The actual application rate will be established from
 tests made prior to beginning treatment. The design of soil-lime-fly ash courses shall be
 performed by the Central Laboratory. At least 45 days prior to the proposed use of a
 lime-fly ash course, the Contractor shall make available materials conforming to the
 specifications and proposed for use in the mixture for sampling and testing by the
 Department as the Engineer may consider necessary for the establishment of a mix
 design.
 The approved proportions of material will govern during the progress of the work, and
 changes in source or character of any material shall not be made without approval.
 Approval will be based on verification of a mix design.
 311.02.2--Curing Seals. Curing seal shall be Emulsified Asphalt, Grade EA-1, EPR-1,
 AE-P, CSS-1, SS-1, CMS-2h, or MS-2h meeting the applicable requirements of Section
 702.
 311.03--Construction Requirements.
 311.03.1--General. Fly ash shall be spread at the specified rate and lightly disked or
 mixed into the soil or soil aggregate prior to spreading the lime.
 
 224
 
 Section 311
 
 Section 311
 
 Prior to the application of fly ash, a light windrow shall be bladed along the edges of the
 area to be treated, or the surface on which the fly ash is to be applied shall be scarified to
 retain the spread fly ash. The depth of scarification shall be carefully controlled so that
 the surface of the roadbed below the scarified material will remain undisturbed and
 conform to the established cross section.
 311.03.2--Equipment. Equipment necessary for the proper prosecution of the work shall
 meet the applicable requirements of Subsection 308.03.2.
 311.03.3--Preparation of Grade. Before treatment, the roadbed shall be prepared in
 accordance with the requirements of Section 321.
 311.03.4--Application.
 311.03.4.1--Fly Ash. Fly ash shall be applied as set out in Subsection 308.03.7, except
 that weather limitations shall be in accordance with Subsection 311.03.5.
 311.03.4.2--Lime. The rate of application of lime shall be as specified.
 Application of lime shall be accomplished by either an approved "dry application" or
 "slurry application" method.
 The following guide lines will govern the acceptability of the method to be used:
 Dry Application. Hydrated lime applied by this method shall be spread uniformly
 and shall be sprinkled with sufficient water to prevent loss of lime by wind.
 Spreading of hydrated lime when wind and weather conditions are unfavorable will
 not be permitted nor will spreading of lime by motor patrol be acceptable. The use
 of quick lime in the "dry application" method will not be permitted.
 Slurry Application. Lime applied by this method shall be mixed with water in
 approved agitation equipment and applied to the roadbed as a thin water suspension
 or slurry. The distributing equipment shall be equipped to provide continuous
 agitation of the slurry until applied on the roadbed. The proportion of lime shall be
 such that the "Dry Solids Content" shall be at least 30 percent by weight.
 The distribution of lime at the rate specified shall be attained by one or more passes over
 a measured section until the specified percentage of lime has been spread. After each
 successive pass the material shall be incorporated into the soil with the mixing
 equipment.
 311.03.5--Weather Limitations. Lime-fly ash treatment shall not be performed when
 either the soil or soil aggregates or the surface on which a lime-fly ash treated material is
 to be laid is wet or frozen or when it is raining or snowing. Processing operations for the
 lime-fly ash course shall not begin until the surface temperature is at least 40°F and
 rising. Construction of the soil/soil aggregate-lime-fly ash stabilized course will not be
 permitted between November 30 and March 1.
 311.03.6--Fly Ash-Lime and Water Mixing Phase. The lime and water shall be
 incorporated uniformly into the soil course of fly ash and aggregate. The mixing and
 water application shall be continued until a homogeneous mixture of which 100 percent
 
 225
 
 Section 311
 
 Section 311
 
 of the material by dry weight, exclusive of gravel and stone, will pass a two-inch sieve
 and 60 percent will pass a No. 4 sieve. At the completion of moist mixing and during the
 compaction operations, the percentage of moisture shall be that necessary to obtain the
 required density. No mellowing period will be required or permitted, and compaction
 shall begin immediately. The mixing, water application, and final compaction shall be
 completed during the same work day.
 311.03.7--Shaping, Compacting, and Finishing.
 311.03.7.1--General. The mixed material shall be shaped as required immediately after
 mixing, or delivery to the roadbed in the case of central plant mixed material. Initial
 compaction shall begin immediately, and machining and compacting shall continue until
 the entire depth and width of the course is compacted to the required density within two
 hours of the time of beginning mixing. Compaction shall be by equipment and methods
 that do not result in lamination.
 Areas inaccessible to rollers shall be compacted to the required density by other approved
 methods.
 The addition of thin layers of treated material in order to conform to cross sectional or
 grade requirements will not be permitted.
 Compaction by vibration shall not be performed after the lime fly-ash has taken its initial
 set. Vibratory compaction of a section shall be completed within one hour.
 During compaction, a spike-tooth harrow or other suitable equipment shall be used as
 required to prevent lamination.
 The surface shall then be reshaped to the required lines, grades, and cross section, and if
 necessary shall be lightly scarified to remove imprints left by the compacting or shaping
 equipment. The surface shall then be sprinkled as necessary and thoroughly rolled with a
 pneumatic roller, and if the mixture contains plus No. 4 aggregate, at least one complete
 coverage of the section shall be made with a steel-wheel tandem roller.
 Surface compaction and finishing for the entire section shall be performed in a manner
 that will produce a smooth, closely knit surface, free from laminations, construction
 cracks, ridges, or loose material, and conforming to the crown, grade, and lines stipulated
 within four hours after the beginning of mixing.
 Upon completion of compaction, testing will be performed in accordance with
 Subsections 700.03 and 700.04.
 311.03.7.2--Density. Determination of acceptance of compaction of treated courses for
 required density will be performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will be each 2,500 linear
 feet per layer placed. At the discretion of the Engineer, a residual portion of a lot
 completed during a day's operation may be considered a separate lot or may be included
 in the previous or subsequent lot, except that any day's operation of less than one full lot
 will be considered a lot.
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The average of the five (5) density tests shall equal or exceed
 
 226
 
 Section 311
 
 Section 311
 
 98.0 percent with no single density test below 94.0 percent. Sublots with a density below
 94.0 percent shall be corrected at no additional cost to the State and retested for
 acceptance.
 For treated materials other than for design soils and bases, the required density will be set
 out elsewhere in the contract.
 311.03.7.3--Width, Thickness, and Surface Requirements. For the purpose of
 determining reasonable conformity with the designated width of a treated course, it shall
 be understood that the width of a treated course shall not vary from the designated edge
 lines by more than plus or minus one inch.
 For the purpose of determining reasonable conformance with the designated thickness of
 a treated course, it shall be understood that the depth of the treated course shall not vary
 from designated thickness by more than minus one-half (1/2) inch or plus one (1) inch.
 The finished surface of a treated course shall conform to the requirements shown on the
 plans, within the tolerances allowable under Section 321.
 311.03.8--Protection and Curing. Each completed course shall be covered with a
 bituminous curing seal as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after completion.
 The surface shall be sealed with one of the specified bituminous materials applied by a
 pressure distributor at the rate of 0.10 to 0.25 gallon per square yard or as directed by the
 Engineer. The bituminous material shall be heated or otherwise prepared to ensure
 uniform distribution. Should the Contractor fail to seal the lime-fly ash course within the
 time specified, the Engineer will suspend all other work and withhold payment of the
 current estimate(s) until all damages resulting therefrom is corrected and the lime-fly ash
 course is sealed.
 A subsequent course shall not be placed on the sealed lime-fly ash course for at least
 seven (7) calendar days. During this 7-day period, the lime-fly ash course shall not be
 subjected to any type of traffic and equipment.
 The Contractor shall maintain the lime-fly ash course and the curing seal in a satisfactory
 condition until covered by a subsequent course. Protection shall include immediate
 repairs of any surface irregularities or other defects that may occur or develop. It shall be
 the Contractor's responsibility to control traffic and equipment loads to avoid damage and
 to guard against freezing of the lime-fly ash treated material.
 All damage resulting from the Contractor's failure to protect and cure the lime-fly ash
 course as specified herein or from freezing that may occur prior to being covered with the
 next course shall be corrected at no additional cost to the State.
 The Contractor shall submit, for approval of the Engineer, a method of correction that
 will restore the strength of the damaged material to that originally specified.
 311.04--Method of Measurement. Lime and fly ash will be measured by the ton in
 accordance with Section 109. If bagged lime is used, the net weight as packaged by the
 manufacturer will be used for measurement.
 The basis of pay for jobsite slaked lime slurry shall be the "calculated method" as
 
 227
 
 Section 311
 
 Section 311
 
 provided for jobsite slaked lime slurry in Subsection 307.04.
 Aggregate will be measured by the ton or cubic yard (LVM). When measurement is by
 weight, the weight of moisture, surface and hygroscopic, will be deducted.
 Processing will be measured by the square yard and shall include preparation of the
 roadbed, scarifying, pulverizing, drying of the material, mixing of the various materials,
 compaction of the mixture, finishing, protection and curing, and maintenance of the
 completed course.
 Bituminous curing seal will be measured by the gallon as prescribed in Subsection
 109.01. Unless otherwise specified, distributor tank measurements will be used. The
 volume of material over five percent above the allowed range for each shot will be
 deducted from measured quantities, except that 15 percent will be allowed for irregular
 areas where hand spraying is necessary. The volume of all bituminous material lost,
 wasted, damaged, or rejected, or applied outside of designated areas, or in excess of the
 Engineer's directions and tolerances allowed, or contrary to the specifications, will be
 deducted from measured quantities.
 Water will not be measured for separate payment.
 311.05--Basis of Payment. The accepted quantities of lime and fly ash treated material
 will be paid for at the contract price per ton for lime and fly ash, per ton or cubic yard
 (LVM) for aggregate, and per square yard for processing lime and fly ash treated material
 complete in place. The prices thus paid shall be full compensation for completing the
 work.
 Bituminous curing seal, measured as prescribed above, will be paid for at the contract
 unit price per gallon, which price shall be full compensation for furnishing, applying and

 control items specified for the shoulder portion of the work. All work shall conform to
 the sequence and timing indicated herein and to the other applicable requirements of the
 contract.
 This work shall also include preservation from injury or damage to and repair and
 reconstruction of, if necessary, underlying courses and other elements of the pavement
 structure. Except as otherwise specified, construction of shoulders shall also include
 reshaping, finishing, and mowing of cut ditches, foreslopes, and upper embankment
 slopes adjacent to shoulders. Areas to receive this work shall include the areas between
 the finished shoulder line and the same elevation at the back of the ditch in cut sections
 and the areas on fill slopes between the finished shoulder line and a line 12 feet
 horizontally outside the finished shoulder line. Similar areas in the median portion of
 divided highways shall also be reshaped and finished.
 320.02--Materials. Materials used in constructing shoulders shall meet the applicable
 requirements of Division 700.
 320.03--Construction Requirements.
 320.03.1--Preparation of Grade.
 Before beginning each course of shoulder
 construction, the foundation shall be prepared in accordance with Section 321.
 320.03.2--Construction Details. Except as otherwise specified, the construction of each
 course of the shoulders shall be in accordance with controlling requirements for bases
 constructed of like material.
 Shoulder construction shall begin at the earliest practicable time and proceed in the
 proper sequence with contiguous base or pavement construction. Each designated course
 for shoulders shall be constructed to the established lines, grades, and cross sections
 within tolerances allowable under Section 321 and shall be firm and stable; reference is
 made to Subsection 321.03.
 Determination of acceptance of compaction of shoulders for required density will be
 performed on a lot to lot basis. Each lot will consist of each day's operation per layer
 placed, with a maximum lot length of 10,000 linear feet.
 The lot will be divided into five approximately equal sublots with one density test taken
 at random in each sublot. The lot average and each single density test shall conform to
 the required density.
 The required density for the shoulder portion of any layer or course shall be the same as
 for the adjacent (internal) portion of the layer or course when constructed of the same
 material.

 (b) Where an existing pavement is to be overlaid, or widened and overlaid, without
 shoulder widening, and the existing shoulder is to be raised to match the new
 pavement, satisfactory density of each layer of new shoulder material shall be
 that which can be obtained from six coverages of a pneumatic roller with an
 operating weight of approximately six tons while the shoulder material is at the
 proper moisture content.
 In cases of base or pavement in which cement is used as a material of construction,
 shoulder construction shall follow immediately upon expiration of the curing period,
 unless it has been otherwise provided that the shoulder course be constructed in advance
 of the contiguous course.
 The rate of progress for each phase of shoulder construction shall be consistent with the
 rate of progress of the controlling construction. When the Engineer deems that other
 operations are being carried on to the unnecessary neglect of shoulder construction, the
 Engineer may suspend the operations in progress and order that shoulder construction be
 brought up to and then continued, without prejudice to other work, in the proper
 sequence.
 320.04--Blank.
 320.05--Basis of Payment. Unless otherwise specified in the contract, no separate
 payment will be made for shoulder construction. Payment will be made for the materials
 and their processing when set up in the contract as pay items. All additional work
 involved in shoulder construction is considered an obligation of the Contractor subsidiary
 to the placement of the materials required and work performed for which provisions for
 payment are contained in the contract.
 
 SECTION 321 - IN-GRADE PREPARATION
 321.01--Description. The term "in-grade preparation" is defined as the work required to
 prepare, blade, shape, scarify, disk, mix, compact, etc. the existing material to
 specification requirements prior to placement of a subsequent course of material.
 Figure 1, Section 101, graphically defines the limits of the roadway, the design soil and
 the components of the pavement structure.
 In-grade preparation shall be in reasonable close conformity with the lines, grades, and
 
 230
 
 Section 321
 
 Section 321
 
 typical section(s) shown on the plans. All work will be performed in the sequence and
 timing specified.
 No direct compensation will be allowed for in-grade preparation, except as specifically
 provided herein.
 321.01.1--Applicability. In-grade preparation will be required on all projects that require
 replacement of any component of a pavement structure or chemical treatment of the
 design soil.
 In-grade preparation will not be required on pavements or chemically treated courses that
 are to remain in place undisturbed.
 Unless otherwise specified, the in-grade preparation course shall be the top six inches of
 the design soil.
 321.02--Blank.
 321.03--Construction Requirements.
 321.03.1--General. Prior to beginning in-grade preparation, the roadway will be cleaned
 of all vegetation or debris, bladed, shaped and filled as necessary to obtain the required
 line, grades and typical section as shown on the plans or as specified. The Contractor
 will perform unclassified excavation where required for grade changes, removal of
 temporary ramps at bridge ends, shape foreslopes and cut ditches to the required line,
 grade and typical section, and other work required to alter work performed on previous
 contracts. All material obtained in preparation prior to in-grade preparation work will be
 disposed of or utilized by the Contractor.
 321.03.2--First In-Grade Course.
 321.03.2.1--Design Soil. When the first in-grade preparation course is the top portion of
 the design soil, which was constructed under a previous contract, the top six inches,
 unless a greater depth is specified, shall be broken up, either by scarifying or blading to
 the specified depth and then thoroughly mixed by a disk-harrow. If the embankment
 design soil was constructed under this contract in accordance with the requirements of
 Section 203, then only the cut section will require mixing as stated herein. The disk shall
 be of sufficient weight and size to cut a minimum depth of eight inches, or ten inches
 when eight inches design soil mixing is required, in loose material. After mixing with a
 disk-harrow, the roadway will be shaped and compacted to the proper section and
 density.
 321.03.2.2--Component of Pavement Structure. When the first in-grade preparation
 course is a component of the pavement structure, other than design soil, the course shall
 be prepared by blading, shaping to the specified section, and compacting to the specified
 density for the particular layer being prepared.
 321.03.3--Unsuitable Materials. All
 compacted to the required density, shall
 material removed will be replaced by
 material was placed under this contract,
 
 materials which cannot be stabilized and
 be removed and disposed of as directed. The
 acceptable materials. Unless the unsuitable
 the removal, disposal, and replacement of the
 
 231
 
 Section 321
 
 Section 321
 
 material will be measured and paid for under the appropriate items of the contract.
 Materials that meet contract requirements, except for moisture content, will not be
 classified as unsuitable materials.
 321.03.4--Stability. When density and stability cannot be obtained due to the instability
 of the underlying material, the Contractor will take the necessary action to stabilize and
 compact the underlying material. Unless the unstable material was placed under this
 contract, the work required to stabilize and compact the material will be paid for under
 the appropriate items of the contract. When the Contractor has initiated appropriate
 action to stabilize and compact the underlying material and density cannot be obtained,
 then the material will be classified as unsuitable and proceed in accordance with
 Subsection 321.03.3.
 321.03.5--Haul, Protection and Repair. All materials hauled through or over any part
 of the project shall be hauled in the sequence and manner to cause the least damage to the
 previously placed course. The Contractor's operations shall provide the maximum
 protection to each course in place from deformation or contamination from underlying
 material.
 The first course of material to be placed on a chemically treated design soil shall be
 placed by hauling to the point nearest the source of the material, thus hauling over the
 material being placed. Subsequent hauling shall be over the maximum practical
 thickness of material in order to provide the greatest protection to the underlying
 material.
 The Contractor shall satisfactorily maintain the material over which he is hauling, and the
 materials being hauled shall be spread as hauling progresses to prevent hauling
 equipment from repetitive passes alongside lines of dumped and unspread material.
 The Contractor shall repair, at no additional cost to the State, all damage to prepared ingrade material whether the material was placed under this contract or under previous
 contract.
 321.03.6--Density. The required density for in-grade preparation of courses that do not
 require a chemical treatment or modification shall be the required density for the
 particular course. The required density for courses that require chemical treatment or
 modification shall be 93.0 percent prior to the addition of the chemical, stabilizer or
 modification.
 321.03.7--Tolerances.
 321.03.7.1--General. It shall be understood that although certain tolerances in grade,
 cross section, and density are allowable under the specifications, it shall be the
 Contractor's responsibility to prepare the surface of all in-grade courses to the degree of
 true grade and cross section and to the density and stability necessary to ensure the ability
 to construct subsequent courses to the specified requirements for surface, thickness, and
 compaction. It is essential in pavement structure construction that the degree of accuracy
 must be increased for each succeeding course in order that the final surface requirements
 can be met and the thickness of each course will be within design tolerances. It shall be
 the Contractor's responsibility to construct each course to the degree of accuracy,
 maximum allowable tolerances notwithstanding, necessary to ensure meeting final
 
 232
 
 Section 321
 
 Section 321
 
 requirements.
 321.03.7.2--Vertical Tolerances. No vertical tolerances will be allowed that will pond
 water. Otherwise, allowable tolerances will be as follows:
 321.03.7.2.1-For Design Soil.
 Tolerances from Design Grade:

 Notes: (4) The Contractor may construct the course at the form line to a tentative
 grade having a tolerance of not more than minus 1/2 inch, in which case
 the Contractor shall, at no additional cost to the State, bring the surface of
 the base at the form line to the specified grade and density with materials
 and methods approved by the Engineer and consistent with the
 requirements for foundation formation for forms or tracks required under
 the contract.
 (5) Provided the Contractor places at no additional cost to the State, at the
 time of placing concrete base course or pavement, the additional concrete

 Section 321
 
 hereinbefore with an appropriate allowance having been made in the grade prior to
 spreading the aggregate to compensate for anticipated bulking.
 321.03.7.2.6--Thickness. Unless otherwise specified and except for chemical treatment,
 mechanical stabilization, in-grade modification, and in-grade preparation of the top
 portion of the design soil, no thickness determination as such will be required for bases.
 The preceding tolerances from design grade shall determine the tolerance limits for
 thickness.
 The thickness tolerance for in-grade preparation of the top portion of design soil shall be
 plus or minus one inch. For chemical treatment, mechanical stabilization, or in-grade
 modification, thickness tolerances shall be those set out in the sections applicable to the
 required courses.
 321.03.7.3--Horizontal Tolerances. Allowable horizontal tolerances for in-grade
 preparation shall be those set out in the respective sections for the required courses.
 Where no horizontal tolerance is specified, the tolerance for a course shall be that which
 will not result in an unsightly appearance or detract from the esthetic value of the finished
 crown line and slope.
 Each course of base and shoulder materials, and combined courses of shoulder materials
 and the top portion of the design soil shall be shaped in such a manner that after
 compaction the finished course and combined courses shall closely conform to the
 widths, lines grades, and cross sections shown on the plans or established.
 321.04--Method of Measurement. Unless shown as a separate pay item in the proposal,
 in-grade preparation will not be measured for direct payment, but shall be considered a
 necessary part of the construction involved, and the cost thereof shall be included in the
 appropriate contract unit prices.
 When shown as a separate pay item, in-grade preparation of the depth specified will be
 measured by the mile for each separate roadway of the main facility without respect to
 width or number of lanes or courses involved. No separate measurement for payment
 will be made for frontage roads, interchanges, intersections, entrances, or other features
 of the work, nor for intersecting roads unless such roads are set out under the contract as
 separate projects. It shall be understood that the cost of in-grade preparation for such
 subsidiary facilities is included in the contract unit price per mile for the main facility.
 In the case of in-grade preparation of material in place under previous contract, if it is
 necessary to excavate, pickup, load, and haul any of the in-grade material for use at other
 locations or for disposal as directed in order to prepare the section in accordance with the
 design grade, typical sections and conditions specified, such work shall be performed and
 will be measured and paid for under the applicable provisions and requirements as
 follows:
 a. When designated in the contract, under the provisions and requirements
 designated.
 b. When material loaded and hauled is used in lieu of material required under
 another item, measurement and payment will be made under the item of use.
 c. Measurement and payment for base or pavement material required in the work
 performed will be made in accordance with the requirements and provisions for
 
 235
 
 Section 321
 
 Section 321
 
 use of such material.
 d. When an item of excavation is not included in the contract, excavation required
 by the Engineer to be picked up, loaded, and hauled to other locations will be
 paid for as Extra Work or at unit prices established by Supplemental Agreement.
 e. Necessary haul of material not specified to be furnished by the Contractor, or not
 designated as absorbed haul (AH), shall be performed and will be paid for as
 provided under Section 205, or, in the event the contract does not provide a unit
 bid price for haul, as Extra Work.
 321.05--Basis of Payment. Except as provided above, no payment will be made for ingrade preparation. It shall be fully understood that compensation: for all specified
 scarifying, disk-harrowing, mixing, or other processing; for furnishing and applying all
 water; for all aerating necessary to dry wet materials; for all shaping and compacting; for
 all other work of whatever nature necessary for preparation as set forth under this section;
 and for furnishing all labor, tools, equipment and incidentals necessary to complete the
 work shall be included in the unit prices for the materials used and the work performed
 under contract items.
 When shown as a separate pay item in the contract, in-grade preparation will be paid for
 at the contract unit price per mile, which price shall be full compensation for
 satisfactorily completing the work.

 At least 10 working days prior to the proposed use of each mixture, the Contractor shall
 submit in writing to the Engineer a proposed job-mix formula or request the transfer of a
 verified job-mix formula as set forth in the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for
 HMA and SOP TMD-11-78-00-000. The proposed job-mix formula shall indicate
 whether the mixture will be produced as HMA or WMA. The process or product used to

 formula. The job-mix formula shall be signed by a Certified Mixture Design Technician
 (CMDT).
 
 241
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 The Department will perform the tests necessary for review of a proposed job-mix
 formula for each required mixture free of charge one time only. A charge will be made
 for additional job-mix formulas submitted by the Contractor for review.
 Review of the proposed job-mix formula will be based on percent maximum specific
 gravity at NInitial, NDesign, and NMaximum, VMA @ NDesign, resistance to stripping, and other
 criteria specified for the mixture.
 The mixture shall conform thereto within the range of tolerances specified for the
 particular mixture. No change in properties or proportion of any component of the jobmix formula shall be made without permission of the Engineer. The job-mix formula for
 each mixture shall be in effect until revised in writing by the Engineer.
 A job-mix formula may be transferred to other contracts in accordance with conditions
 set forth in the Department's Field Manual for HMA.
 The Contractor shall not place any asphalt prior to receiving “tentative” approval and a
 MDOT design number from the Central Laboratory.
 When a change in source of materials, unsatisfactory mixture production results (such as
 segregation, bleeding, shoving, rutting over ⅛”, raveling & cracking) or changed
 conditions make it necessary, a new job-mix formula will be required. The conditions set
 out herein for the original job-mix formula are applicable to the new job-mix formula.
 In the event the Contractor wishes to change from an approved HMA job-mix formula to
 WMA or an approved WMA job-mix formula to HMA, the Contractor shall submit the
 proposed change in writing to the Engineer at least 10 working days prior to the proposed
 change. If no changes (other than the plant production temperature) are to be made to the
 job-mix formula, a new MDOT design number will be assigned by the MDOT Central
 Laboratory.
 401.02.4--Substitution of Mixture. The substitution of a one (1) size finer mixture for
 an underlying lift shall require written permission of the State Construction Engineer,
 except no substitution of a 4.75-mm mixture will be allowed. The 19-mm mixture may
 be substituted for the 25-mm mixture in trench widening work. Any substitution of
 mixtures shall be of the same type. No other substitutions will be allowed. The quantity
 of substituted mixture shall be measured and paid for at the contract unit price for the
 mixture designated on the plans. The substitution of any mixture will be contingent on
 meeting the required total structure thickness and maintaining the minimum and/or
 maximum laying thickness for the particular substituted mixture as set out in the
 following table.

 with the average of a minimum of five pavement sample densities. For 4.75mm mixtures, conduct density tests as necessary to control and maintain
 required compaction according to AASHTO T 166.
 (h) Quality Control Charts. Plot the individual test data, the average of the last four
 tests and the control limits for the following items as a minimum:
 Mixture Gradation (Percent Passing) Sieves:
 1/2-inch, 3/8-inch, No. 8, No. 16, No. 30 and No. 200.
 Asphalt Content, Percent
 Maximum Specific Gravity, Gmm
 Total Voids @ NDesign, Percent
 VMA @ NDesign, Percent
 NOTE: For 4.75-mm mixtures, Quality Control Charts for mixture gradation
 are not required on the No. 8 and No. 30 sieves. For 4.75-mm mixtures, as a
 minimum, Quality Control Charts for mixture gradation shall be kept on the 3/8inch, No. 16 and No. 200 sieves. For all mixtures other than 4.75-mm, Quality
 Control Charts for mixture gradation are not required on the No. 16 sieve.
 Quality Control charts shall be updated daily and be available to both Contractor
 and MDOT personnel at any time during the production of asphalt mixture. The
 charts shall note any process changes or adjustments made to the mixture design
 (i) Sampling Frequency. Conduct those tests as required above at the following
 frequency for each mixture produced based on the estimated plant tonnage at the
 beginning of the day.

 NOTE: Material placed in a storage silo from a previous day's production shall
 be randomly sampled and tested when removed for placement on the roadway.
 Such sample(s) shall be independent of the day's production sampling frequency
 and shall be used in calculating the four (4) sample running average.
 (j) Sample Requirements. Obtain the asphalt mixture samples from trucks at the
 plant. Obtain aggregate samples from cold feed bins or aggregate stockpile.
 Save a split portion of all mixture samples at the laboratory site in a dry and
 protected location for 14 calendar days. At the completion of the project, the
 remaining samples may be disposed of with the approval of the Engineer.
 The above testing frequencies are for the estimated plant production for the day. If
 
 244
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 production is discontinued or interrupted, the tests will be conducted at the previously
 established sample tonnage points for the materials that are actually produced. If the
 production exceeds the estimated tonnage, sampling and testing will continue at the
 testing increments previously established for the day. A testing increment is defined as
 the estimated daily tonnage divided by the required number of tests from the table in
 Subsection 401.02.5.3 paragraph (i).
 In addition to the above program, the following tests shall be conducted on the first day
 of production and once for every eight production samples thereafter, with a minimum of
 one test per production week.
 Aggregate Stockpile Gradations per AASHTO Designations: T-11 and T-27.
 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Gradation per Mississippi Test Method MT-31.
 Fine Aggregate Angularity for all 4.75-mm and 9.5-mm mixtures and all MT and HT
 mixtures designed above the maximum density line per ASTM C 1252, Method A.
 Testing of the aggregate and RAP stockpiles during production will be waived provided
 the Contractor provides the Engineer with gradation test results for the materials in the
 stockpile determined during the building of the stockpiles. The test results provided shall
 represent a minimum frequency of one per one thousand tons of material in the stockpile.
 If the Contractor continues to add materials to the stockpile during asphalt production, the
 requirements for gradation testing during production are not waived.
 401.02.5.4--Documentation. The Contractor shall document all observations, records of
 inspection, adjustments to the mixture, and test results on a daily basis. All tests
 conducted by the Contractor in accordance with Subsection 401.02.5.3(h) shall be
 included in the running average calculations. If single tests are performed as a check on
 individual asphalt properties, between regular samples, without performing all tests
 required in Subsection 401.02.5.3(h), the results of those individual tests shall not be
 included in the running average calculations for that particular property. The Contractor
 shall record the results of observations and records of inspection as they occur in a
 permanent field record. The Contractor shall record all process adjustments and job mix
 formula (JMF) changes on the air void charts. The Contractor shall provide copies of all
 test data sheets and the daily summary reports on the appropriate MDOT forms to the
 District Materials Engineer on a daily basis. The Contractor shall provide a written
 description of any process change, including blend proportions, to the Engineer as they
 occur. Information provided to the District Materials Engineer must be received in the
 Engineer’s office by no later than 9:00 AM the day after the asphalt is produced. Upon
 completion of the placement of all asphalt for the project, the Contractor shall provide the
 Engineer with the original test reports and control charts in a neat and orderly manner.
 401.02.5.5--Control Limits. The following control limits for the job mix formula (JMF)
 and warning limits are based on a running average of the last four data points.

 401.02.5.6--Warning Bands. Warning bands are defined as the area between the JMF
 limits and the warning limits.
 401.02.5.7--Job Mix Formula Adjustments. A request for a JMF adjustment signed by
 a CAT-II may be made to the Engineer by the Contractor. Sufficient testing data shall be
 submitted with the request to justify the change. The requested change will be reviewed
 by the State Materials Engineer for the Department. If current production values meet
 the mixture design requirements, a revised JMF will be issued. Adjustments to the JMF
 shall conform to the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA. Adjustments to
 the JMF to conform to actual production shall not exceed the tolerances specified for the
 JMF limits. Regardless of such tolerances, any adjusted JMF gradation shall be within
 the design master range for the mixture specified. The JMF asphalt content may only be
 reduced if the production VMA meets or exceeds the minimum design VMA
 requirements for the mixture being produced.
 401.02.5.8--Actions and Adjustments. Based on the process control test results for any
 property in question, the following actions shall be taken or adjustments made when
 appropriate:
 (a) When the running average trends toward the warning limits, the Contractor shall
 consider taking corrective action. The corrective action, if any, shall be
 documented. All tests shall be part of the contract files and shall be included in
 the running average calculations.
 (b) The Contractor shall notify the Engineer whenever the running average exceeds
 the warning limits.
 (c) If two consecutive running averages exceed the warning limit, the Contractor
 shall stop production and make adjustments. Production shall only be restarted
 after notifying the Engineer of the adjustments made.
 (d) If the adjustment made under (c) improves the process such that the running
 average after four additional tests is within the warning limits, the Contractor
 may continue production with no reduction in payment.
 (e) If the adjustment made under (c) does not improve the process and the running
 average after four additional tests stays in the warning band, the mixture will be
 considered unsatisfactory. Reduced payment for unsatisfactory mixtures will be
 applied starting from the stop point to the point when the running average is
 back within the warning limits in accordance with Subsection 401.02.6.3.
 (f) Failure to stop production and make adjustments when required shall subject all
 mixture produced from the stop point to the point when the running average is
 back within the warning limits to be considered unsatisfactory. Reduced
 payment for unsatisfactory mixtures will be applied in accordance with
 Subsection 401.02.6.3.
 (g) If the running average exceeds the JMF limits, the Contractor shall stop
 production and make adjustments. Production shall only be restarted after
 
 246
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 notifying the Engineer of the adjustments made.
 (h) All materials for which the running average exceeds the JMF limits will be
 considered unacceptable and shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at
 no additional cost to the State. The Engineer will determine the quantity of
 material to be replaced based on a review of the individual testing data that
 make up the running average in question and an inspection of the completed
 pavement. If the Engineer decides to leave the mixture in place because of
 special circumstances, the quantity of mixture, as defined above, will be paid for
 in accordance with Subsection 401.02.6.3.
 (i) If only a small quantity of an asphalt type is to be placed on a project, a single
 test result may be compared to 1.7 times the warning and JMF limits. If the test
 results verified by QA testing (within allowable differences in Subsection
 401.02.6.2) exceed these limits, the pay factor provided in Subsection
 401.02.6.3 will apply for the quantity of material represented by the test(s).
 (j) The above corrective action will also apply for a mixture when the Contractor’s
 testing data has been proven incorrect. The Contractor’s data will be considered
 incorrect when; 1) the Contractor’s tests and the Engineer’s tests do not agree
 within the allowable differences given in Subsection 401.02.6.2 and the
 difference can not be resolved, or 2) the Engineer’s tests indicates that
 production is outside the JMF limits and the results have been verified by the
 Materials Division. The Engineer’s data will be used in place of the
 Contractor’s data to determine the appropriate pay factor.
 401.02.6--Standards of Acceptance.
 401.02.6.1--General. Acceptance for mixture quality (VMA and total voids @ NDesign,
 gradation, and asphalt content) will be based on random samples tested in accordance
 with the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA. Pavement densities and
 smoothness will be accepted by lots as set out in Subsections 401.02.6.4 and 401.02.6.8.
 401.02.6.2--Assurance Program for Mixture Quality. The Engineer will conduct a
 quality assurance program. The quality assurance program will be accomplished as
 follows:
 1)
 2)
 3)
 4)
 5)
 
 Conducting verification tests.
 Validate Contractor test results.
 Periodically observing Contractor quality control sampling and testing.
 Monitoring required quality control charts and test results.
 Sampling and testing materials at any time and at any point in the production or
 laydown process.
 
 The rounding of all test results will be in accordance with Subsection 700.04.
 The Engineer will conduct verification tests on samples taken by the Contractor under the
 direct supervision of the Engineer at a time specified by the Engineer. The frequency will be
 equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of the tests required for Contractor quality control
 and the data will be provided to the Contractor within two asphalt mixture production days
 after the sample has been obtained by the Engineer. At least one sample shall be tested from
 the first two days of production. All testing and data analysis shall be performed by a
 Certified Asphalt Technician-I (CAT-I) or by an assistant under the direct supervision of the
 CAT-I. Certification shall be in accordance with the MDOT HMA Technician Certification
 
 247
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 Program chapter in the Materials Division Inspection, Testing, and Certification Manual.
 The Department shall post a chart giving the names and telephone numbers for the personnel
 responsible for the assurance program.
 The Engineer shall be allowed to inspect Contractor testing equipment and equipment
 calibration records to confirm both calibration and condition. The Contractor shall calibrate
 and correlate all testing equipment in accordance with the latest versions of the Department's
 Test Methods and AASHTO R 18.
 Random differences between the Engineer's verification tests and the current running
 average of four quality control tests at the time of obtaining the verification sample will be
 considered acceptable if within the following limits:

 If four quality control tests have not been tested prior to the time of the first verification test,
 the verification test results will be compared to the average of the preceding quality control
 tests. If the verification test is the first material tested on the project or if a significant
 process adjustment was made just prior to the verification test, the verification test results
 will be compared to the average of four subsequent quality control test results. For all other
 cases after a significant process adjustment, the verification test results will be compared to
 the average of the preceding quality control tests (taken after the adjustment) as in the case of
 a new project start-up when four quality control tests are not available.
 In the event that; 1) the comparison of the Contractor’s running average quality control data
 and Engineer’s quality assurance verification test results are outside the allowable
 differences in the above table, or 2) if a bias exists between the results, such that one of the
 results is predominately higher or lower than the other, and the Engineer’s results fail to meet
 the JMF control limits, the Engineer will investigate the reason immediately. As soon as the
 need for an investigation becomes known, the Engineer will increase the quality assurance
 sampling rate to the same frequency required for Contractor testing. The additional samples
 obtained by the Engineer may be used as part of the investigation process or for routine
 quality assurance verification tests. The Engineer's investigation may include testing of the
 remaining quality control split samples, review and observation of the Contractor's testing
 procedures and equipment, and a comparison of split sample test results by the Contractor
 quality control laboratory, Department quality assurance laboratory and the Materials
 Division laboratory. The procedures outlined in the latest edition of Department’s Field
 Manual for HMA may be used as a guide for the investigation. In the event that the
 
 248
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 Contractor’s results are determined to be incorrect, the Engineer's results will be used for the
 quality control data and the appropriate payment for the mixture will be based on the
 procedures specified in Subsection 401.02.5.8(j).
 The Engineer will periodically witness the sampling and testing being performed by the
 Contractor. The Engineer, both verbally and in writing, will promptly notify the Contractor
 of any observed deficiencies. When differences exist between the Contractor and the
 Engineer that cannot be resolved, a decision will be made by the State Materials Engineer,
 acting as the referee. The Contractor will be promptly notified in writing of the decision. If
 the deficiencies are not corrected, the Engineer will stop production until corrective action is
 taken.
 401.02.6.3--Acceptance Procedure for Mixture Quality. All obviously defective
 material or mixture will be subject to rejection by the Engineer. Such defective material
 or mixture shall not be incorporated into the finished work. If the defective material has
 already been placed in the work, the material shall be removed and replaced at no
 additional cost to the State.
 The Engineer will base final acceptance of the asphalt mixture production on the results of
 the Contractor's testing for total voids and VMA @ NDesign, gradation, and asphalt content as
 verified by the Engineer in the manner hereinbefore described and the uniformity and
 condition of the completed pavement. Areas of pavement that exhibit non-uniformity or
 failures, materials or construction related, such as but not limited to segregation, bleeding,
 shoving, rutting over ⅛”, raveling, slippage, or cracking will not be accepted. Such areas
 will be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the State.
 Bituminous mixture placed prior to correction for deficiencies in VMA and total voids @
 NDesign, gradation, or asphalt content, as required in Subsection 401.02.5.8 and determined
 by the Engineer satisfactory to remain in place will be paid for in accordance with the
 following pay factors times the contract unit price per ton.

 401.02.6.4--Acceptance Procedure for Density. Each completed lift will be accepted
 with respect to compaction on a lot to lot basis from density tests performed by the
 Department. For normal production days, divide the production into approximately equal
 lots as shown in the following table. When cores are being used for the compaction
 evaluation, randomly obtain one core from each lot. When the nuclear density gauge is
 being used for compaction evaluation, obtain two random readings from each lot and
 average the results. See Chapter 7 of the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for
 HMA for more details. Additional tests may be required by the Engineer to determine
 
 249
 
 Section 401

 401.02.6.4.1--Roadway Density. The density requirement for each completed lift on a
 lot to lot basis from density tests performed by the Department shall be as follows:
 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 
 4.
 
 For leveling lifts where full lane width is paved and a minimum thickness
 requirement as specified in the table in Subsection 401.02.4 is met, the required
 lot density shall be 92.0 percent of maximum density. For all other leveling, no
 density shall be required but the pavement shall be rolled to refusal
 densification.
 For all single lift overlays, with or without a leveling lift and/or milling, the
 required lot density shall be 92.0 percent of maximum density.
 For all multiple lift overlays of two (2) or more lifts excluding leveling lifts, the
 required lot density of the bottom lift shall be 92.0 percent of maximum density.
 The required lot density for all subsequent lifts shall be 93.0 percent of
 maximum density.
 For all pavements on new construction except shoulders that are untreated, the
 required lot density for all lifts shall be 93.0 percent of maximum density. For
 all pavements on shoulders that are untreated, the required lot density for all lifts
 shall be 92.0 percent of maximum density.
 
 When it is determined that the density for a lot is below the required density (93.0 percent
 or 92.0 percent) but not lower than 91.0 or 90.0 percent of maximum density,
 respectively, the Contractor will have the right to remove and replace the lot(s) not
 meeting the specified density requirements in lieu of accepting reduced payment for the
 lot(s).
 When it is determined that the density for a lot is above 96.0 percent, the Engineer shall
 notify the Contractor who will make plant adjustments to resolve the problem.
 When it is determined that the density for a lot is below 91.0 or 90.0 percent,
 respectively, the lot(s), or portions thereof shall be removed and replaced in accordance
 with Chapter 7 of the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA at no additional
 cost to the State. A corrected lot will be retested for approval. No resampling will be
 performed when pavement samples are used for determining density.
 At any time the average daily compaction (the total of the percent compaction for the lots
 produced in one day divided by the total number of lots for the day) does not meet the
 
 250
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 required percent compaction or more for two consecutive days, the Contractor shall
 notify the Engineer of proposed changes to the compactive effort. If the average daily
 compaction does not meet the required percent compaction or more for a third
 consecutive day, the Contractor shall stop production until compaction procedures are
 established to meet the specified density requirements.
 Each lot of work found not to meet the density requirement of 92.0% or 93% of
 maximum density, respectively, may remain in place with a reduction in payment as set
 out in the following tables:

 The compaction pay factors and mixture quality pay factor, as described in Subsection
 401.02.6.3, will each apply separately. However, the combined pay factor shall not be
 less than 0.50 for any mixture allowed to remain in place.
 401.02.6.4.2--Trench Widening Density. The density for trench widening on a lot to lot
 basis shall be determined from density tests performed by the Department using
 pavement samples (cores).
 When it is determined that the density for a trench widening lot is below 89.0 percent but
 not lower than 88.0 percent of maximum density, the Contractor will have the right to
 remove and replace the lot(s) not meeting the specified density requirements in lieu of
 accepting reduced payment for the lot(s).
 When it is determined that the density for a trench widening lot is above 95.0 percent, the
 Engineer shall notify the Contractor who will make plant adjustments to resolve the
 problem.

 When it is determined that the density for a trench widening lot is below 88.0 percent, the
 lot(s), or portions thereof shall be removed and replaced in accordance with Chapter 7 of
 the latest edition of Department’s Field Manual for HMA at no additional cost to the
 State. A corrected lot will be retested for approval. No resampling will be performed
 when pavement samples are used for determining density.
 At any time the daily compaction (the total of the percent compaction for the lots
 produced in one day divided by the total number of lots for the day) does not meet 89.0
 percent compaction or more for two consecutive days, the Contractor shall notify the
 Engineer of proposed changes to the compactive effort. If the average daily compaction
 does not meet 89.0 percent compaction or more for a third consecutive day, the
 Contractor shall stop production until compaction procedures are established to meet the
 specified density requirement.
 Each lot of trench widening work found not to meet the density requirement of 89.0
 percent of maximum density may remain in place with a reduction in payment as set out
 in the following table:

 less than 0.50 for any mixture allowed to remain in place.
 401.02.6.5--Blank.
 401.02.6.6--Blank.
 401.02.6.7--Surface Correction.
 Corrective work to sections exceeding short
 continuous interval thresholds reported by ProVal, as described in Subsection 403.03.2.1,
 shall consist of diamond grinding in accordance with these specifications or methods
 approved by the Engineer. All surface areas corrected by grinding shall be sealed with a
 sealant approved by the Engineer.
 401.02.6.7.1--Diamond Grinding. Grinding of asphalt surfaces shall consist of diamond
 grinding the existing asphalt pavement surface to remove surface distortions to achieve
 the specified surface smoothness requirements.
 401.02.6.7.2--Equipment. The grinding equipment shall be a power driven, selfpropelled machine that is specifically designed to smooth and texture pavement surfaces
 with diamond blades. The effective wheel base of the machine shall not be less than 12.0
 
 252
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 feet. It shall have a set of pivoting tandem bogey wheels at the front of the machine and
 the rear wheels shall be arranged to travel in the track of the fresh cut pavement. The
 center of the grinding head shall be no further than 3.0 feet forward from the center of the
 back wheels.
 The equipment shall be of a size that will cut or plane at least two feet (2’) wide. It shall
 also be of a shape and dimension that does not encroach on traffic movement outside of
 the work area. The equipment shall be capable of grinding the surface without causing
 spalls at joints, or other locations.
 401.02.6.7.3--Construction. The construction operation shall be scheduled and proceed
 in a manner that produces a uniform finish surface. Grinding will be accomplished in a
 manner to provide positive lateral drainage by maintaining a constant cross-slope
 between grinding extremities in each lane.
 The operation shall result in pavement that conforms to the typical cross-section and the
 requirements specified in Subsection 401.02.6.7.4. It is the intent of this specification
 that the surface smoothness characteristics be within the limits specified.
 The Contractor shall establish positive means for removal of grinding residue. Solid
 residue shall be removed from pavement surfaces before it is blown by traffic action or
 wind. Residue shall not be permitted to flow across lanes used by public traffic or into
 gutters or drainage facilities, but may be allowed to flow into adjacent ditches.
 401.02.6.7.4--Finished Pavement Surface. The grinding process shall produce a
 pavement surface that is smooth and uniform in appearance with a longitudinal line type
 texture. The line type texture shall contain parallel longitudinal corrugations that present
 a narrow ridge corduroy type appearance. The peaks of the ridges shall not be more than
 1/16 inch higher than the bottoms of the grooves.
 The finished pavement surface will be measured for riding quality. The grinding shall
 produce a riding surface that does not exceed either the specified profile index or the
 specified bump and dip limit.
 401.02.6.8--Acceptance Procedure for Pavement Smoothness Using Mean
 Roughness Index (MRI). When compaction is completed, the lift shall have a uniform
 surface and be in reasonably close conformity with the line, grade and cross section
 shown on the plans.
 The smoothness of the surface lift will be determined by using an Inertial Profiling
 System (IPS) to measure and record roughness data in each designated location.
 Roughness data for each longitudinal profile will be reported as a Mean Roughness Index
 (MRI). MRI is calculated by averaging the International Roughness Index (IRI) values
 from the two individual wheelpath profiles. The surface shall be tested and corrected to a
 smoothness index as described herein with the exception of those locations or specific
 projects that are excluded from smoothness testing with an IPS.
 The smoothness of the surface lift will be determined for traffic lanes, auxiliary lanes,
 climbing lane and two-way turn lanes. Areas excluded from a smoothness test with the
 IPS are acceleration and deceleration lanes, tapered sections, transition sections for width,
 shoulders, crossovers, ramps, side street returns, etc. The roadway pavement on bridge
 
 253
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 replacement projects having 1,000 feet or less of pavement on each side of the structure
 will be excluded from a smoothness test. Pavement on horizontal curves having a radius
 of less than 1,000 feet at the centerline and pavement within the super elevation transition
 of such curves are excluded from smoothness testing. Smoothness testing shall terminate
 264 feet from each transverse joint that separates the pavement from a bridge deck,
 bridge approach slab or existing pavement not constructed under the contract. This shall
 apply to any other exceptions including, but not limited to, railroad crossings and
 manholes. Segments containing a considerable amount of encroachments such as
 intersections, manholes, curb and gutter sections, etc. may be excluded at the Project
 Engineer’s discretion.
 Initial smoothness measurements shall take place no more than 72 hours following
 placement of surface and must be performed at the posted speed limit or 50 miles per
 hour (±5 mile per hour), whichever is lower. This testing window may be waived for
 single lift (Category C) overlay projects at the Engineer’s discretion. This speed
 requirement will be waived for all lightweight profilers. Measurements will be made in
 both wheel paths of exterior and interior lanes. The wheel paths shall be designated as
 being located three feet (3’) and nine feet (9’) from centerline or longitudinal joint,
 respectively. Beginning and ending latitude and longitude coordinates shall be required
 on each smoothness surface test. Testing will also be required on sections that have been
 surface corrected. No smoothness testing shall be performed when there is moisture of
 any kind on the pavement surface. Any additional testing shall meet the requirements of
 Subsection 403.03.2.
 The surface lift will be accepted on a continuous interval basis for pavement smoothness.
 Continuous reporting is based upon all MRI values for a specified running interval.
 These values are averaged and presented at the midpoint of the specified running interval.
 The last 15 feet of a day's lift may not be obtainable until the lift is continued and for this
 reason may be included in the subsequent section.
 Areas of localized roughness exceeding the continuous 25-foot interval threshold

 vehicle number, gross weight, tare weight, net weight and total daily net weight.
 When approved by the Engineer and materials are measured directly from a storage bin
 equipped with load cells, exceptions may be made to the gross and tare weight
 requirements.
 The ticket shall also have a place for recording the temperature of asphalt mixtures, if
 applicable, and the signatures of the Department’s plant and roadway inspectors. The
 load numbers for each project shall begin with load number one (1) for the first load of
 the day and shall be numbered consecutively without a break until the last load of the
 day. The Contractor shall provide the Department with an original and one copy of each
 ticket. When the ticket information provided by the Contractor proves to be
 unsatisfactory, the Department will use imprinter(s) and imprinter tickets to record load
 information. All recorded weights shall be in pounds and shall be accurate to within onehalf of one percent of the true weight, and the system shall be sensitive to 20 pounds.
 The Engineer may require random loads to be checked on certified platform scales at no
 cost to the Department. If the electronic scales are found to be inaccurate, a recertification of the scales shall be performed before the Contractor can continue use of
 the scales.
 When an electronic weighing system utilizes the plant scales of a batch plant, the system
 may be used only in conjunction with a fully automatic batching and control system.
 401.03.2.2--Additional Requirements for Batching Plants.

 option of the Contractor provided each system is approved by the Department prior to
 use. Surge bins shall be emptied at the end of each day's operation. Storage silos may be
 used to store mixtures as follows:
 19-mm & 25-mm mixtures ......................................................................... 24 hours
 9.5-mm & 12.5-mm mixtures ..................................................................... 36 hours
 The storage silos must be well sealed, completely heated and very well insulated. The
 mixture when removed from the storage silo shall be tested to ensure that it meets all the
 same specifications and requirements as the mixture delivered directly to the paving site.
 See Subsection 401.02.5.3, subparagraph (i) for sampling and testing requirements.
 401.03.3--Hauling Equipment. The inside surfaces of each vehicle bed shall be coated
 with a light application of water and thin oil, soap solution, lime water solution or other
 approved material to prevent the mixture from sticking. Diesel fuel or gasoline shall not
 be used to lubricate vehicle beds. Truck beds shall be raised to drain excessive lubricants
 before placing mixture in the bed. An excess of lubricant will not be permitted.
 401.03.4--Asphalt Mixture Pavers. The screed shall be capable of vibrating and heating
 the full width of the mixture being placed and shall lay the lift with an automatic control
 device to the specified slope and grade without tearing, pulling or gouging the mixture
 surface. Rigid screed and auger extensions should be used when the width of the screed
 is not adequate to pave a full lane width or full paved width (lane width plus shoulder
 width). Typically, the end of the auger extension should extend to approximately 18
 inches or less from the end plate to ensure uniform mixture placement. Strike-off
 extensions should be avoided wherever possible but may be used for items such as
 driveway/mailbox turnouts or intersections in which frequent variations in pavement
 width are encountered.
 401.03.5--Rollers. All rollers shall be self-propelled units capable of maintaining a
 smooth and uniform forward and reverse speed as required for proper compaction. They
 shall be equipped with adjustable scrapers, water tanks, mats and a device for wetting the
 wheels or tires to prevent the mixture from sticking. Adhesion of the mixture to the
 rollers will not be permitted. The use of diesel fuel or gasoline for cleaning roller wheels
 or tires or to aid in preventing the mixture from sticking to the wheels or tires is
 prohibited.
 All rollers shall be in good mechanical condition, free from leaking fuels and lubricants,
 loose link motion, faulty steering mechanism, worn king bolts and bearings. They shall
 be operational at slow speeds to avoid displacement of the mixture and capable of
 reversing direction smoothly and without backlash.

 401.03.8.1--Preparation of Mixture For HMA. The temperature of the mixture, when
 discharged from the mixer, shall not exceed 340°F.
 401.03.8.2--Preparation of Mixture For WMA. Warm mix asphalt is defined as a plant
 produced asphalt mixture that can be produced and constructed at lower temperatures
 than typical hot mix asphalt. Typical temperature ranges of non-polymer modified,
 WMA produced by foaming the asphalt binder at the plant are typically 270ºF to 295ºF at
 the point of discharge of the plant. Typical temperature ranges of polymer modified,
 WMA produced by foaming the asphalt binder at the plant are typically 280ºF to 305ºF at
 the point of discharge of the plant. WMA produced by addition of a terminal blended
 additive may allow the producer to reduce the temperatures below 270ºF as long as all
 mixture quality and field density requirements are met. Production temperatures at the
 plant may need to be increased or decreased due to factors such as material
 characteristics, environmental conditions, and haul time to achieve mixture temperatures
 at the time of compaction in which uniform mat density can be achieved.
 401.03.9--Material Transfer Equipment. Excluding the areas mentioned below, the
 material transferred from the hauling unit when placing the top lift, or the top two (2) lifts
 of a multi-lift asphalt pavement with density requirements, shall be remixed prior to
 being placed in the paver hopper or insert by using an approved Materials Transfer
 Device. Information on approved devices can be obtained from the State Construction
 Engineer. Areas excluded from this requirement include: leveling courses, temporary
 work of short duration, detours, bridge replacement projects having less than 1,000 feet
 of pavement on each side of the structure, acceleration and deceleration lanes less than
 1,000 feet in length, tapered sections, transition sections for width, shoulders less than 10
 feet in width, crossovers, ramps, side street returns and other areas designated by the
 Engineer.
 401.03.10--Spreading and Finishing. Grade control for asphalt pavements shall be
 established by stringline at least 500 feet ahead of spreading, unless placement is adjacent
 to curb and gutter, concrete pavement, or other allowed grade control.
 The mixture shall be spread to the depth and width that will provide the specified
 compacted thickness, line, grade and cross section. Placing of the mixture shall be as
 continuous as possible. On areas where mechanical spreading and finishing is
 impracticable, the mixture may be spread, raked and luted by hand tools.
 
 261
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 Immediately after screeding and prior to compaction, the surface shall be checked by the
 Contractor and irregularities adjusted. When the edge is feathered as in a wedge lift, it
 may be sealed by rolling. Irregularities in alignment and grade along the edges shall be
 corrected before the edges are rolled.
 Hauling, spreading and finishing equipment shall be furnished that is capable of and
 operated in such a manner that the rolling operation will satisfactorily correct any surface
 blemishes.
 The longitudinal joint in the subsequent lift shall offset that in the underlying lift by
 approximately six (6) inches. However, the joint in the top lift shall be at the centerline
 or lane line.
 401.03.11--Compaction. After the mixture has been spread and surface irregularities
 corrected, it shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted to the required line, grade,
 cross section and density.
 401.03.12--Joints. Joints between previously placed pavement and pavement being
 placed shall be so formed as to ensure thorough and continuous bond.
 Transverse construction joints shall be formed by cutting the previously placed mixture to
 expose the full depth of the lift.
 The contact surface of transverse joints and longitudinal joints, except hot joints, shall be
 sprayed with a thin uniform tack coating before additional mixture is placed against the
 previously placed material.
 Longitudinal joints shall be formed by overlapping the screed on the previously placed
 material for a width of at least one (1) inch and depositing the quantity of mixture to form
 a smooth, tight joint.
 Joint Sealant. When a pay item for 403-S, Joint Sealant, is included in the contract, the
 contact surface of transverse joints and longitudinal joints in the surface lift, except hot
 joints, shall be sealed by spraying the joint prior to placement of additional asphalt
 against the previously placed material. Joint sealant shall be an approved sealant listed
 on the Department’s APL. Manufacture’s recommendations shall be followed if the
 material needs to be re-heated, and when placing the thin, uniform coat.
 Prior to application of the sealant, the face of the joint shall be thoroughly dry and free
 from dust or any other material that would prevent proper sealing. All joints shall be
 swept or blown free of loose material, dirt, vegetation, and other debris by means of
 compressed air or a power sweeper.
 Truck and vehicle traffic shall not drive across a sealed joint until it has dried sufficient to
 prevent damage from tracking.
 The Contractor shall furnish the Engineer three copies of the manufacturer’s certification
 stating that the material used meets the requirement of the specifications.
 401.03.13--Pavement Samples. The Contractor shall cut samples from each lift of
 
 262
 
 Section 401
 
 Section 401
 
 asphalt at the time and locations designated by the Engineer. The samples shall be taken
 for the full depth of each lift and shall be of a size approved by the Engineer but not to
 exceed 120 square inches. Tools used for cutting or coring of samples shall be of the
 revolving blade type such as saw or core drill. Cores shall be taken using a 4.0 to 6.0inch inside diameter coring bit. The sample hole shall be filled, compacted and finished
 by the Contractor to conform to the surrounding area. No additional compensation will
 be allowed for furnishing samples and repairing the areas with new pavement.
 401.03.14--Shoulder Wedge. The Contractor shall attach a device to the screed of the
 paver that confines the material at the end gate and extrudes the asphalt material in such a
 way that results in a compacted wedge shape pavement edge of approximately 30
 degrees, but not steeper than 35 degrees. The device shall maintain contact between itself
 and the road shoulder surface and allow for automatic transition to cross roads,
 driveways, and obstructions. The device shall be used to constrain the asphalt head
 reducing the area by 10% to 15% increasing the density of the extruded profile.
 Conventional single plate strike off shall not be used.
 Short sections of handwork will be allowed when necessary for transitions and turnouts,
 or otherwise authorized by the Engineer.
 Information on approved devices can be obtained from the State Construction Engineer.
 If the Contractor has a similar device they want to get approved, the Contractor shall
 provide proof that the device has been used on previous projects with acceptable results,
 or construct a test section prior to the beginning of work and demonstrate wedge
 compaction to the satisfaction of the State Construction Engineer.

 Wet Strength / Dry Strength ................................ 85 percent minimum
 Interior Face Coating ........................................... 95 percent minimum
 Boiling Water Test (MT-59)
 Particle Coating ................................................... 95 percent minimum
 * MT-63 shall be performed at design air void content of OGFC mixtures rather than
 seven percent (7%) air voids. Vacuum saturation shall not be required. All other
 testing parameters shall apply.
 Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) or crushed reclaimed concrete may not be used as an
 aggregate component in the production of OGFC.
 402.02.3.1.1--Mixture Properties. All mixes shall be designed according to Mississippi
 Test Method MT-83. OGFC mixes shall be designed with the Superpave gyratory
 compactor utilizing an Ndesign of 50 gyrations. The design air voids for all OGFC mixes
 shall be a minimum of 15.0 percent, as determined by ASTM D 6752 (vacuum sealing
 method). The ratio of the voids in the coarse aggregate in the compacted mix (VCAmix)
 to the voids in the coarse aggregate as determined with the dry rodded unit weight test
 (VCAdr) shall be less than 1.0.

 402.02.3.2--Job Mix Formula. At least 14 working days prior to the proposed use of
 each mixture, the Contractor shall submit in writing to the Engineer a proposed job-mix
 formula or request the transfer of a verified job-mix formula as set forth in the latest
 edition of the Department’s Field Manual for HMA and MT-83. The job-mix formula
 shall be signed by a Certified Mixture Design Technician (CMDT).
 The Department will perform the tests necessary for review of a proposed job-mix
 formula for each OGFC mixture free of charge one time only. A charge will be made for
 additional job-mix formulas submitted by the Contractor for review.
 Review of the proposed job-mix formula will be based on ratio of Voids in the Coarse
 Aggregate (VCAmix/VCAdr), draindown, permeability, abrasion loss, resistance to
 stripping, and other criteria specified for the mixture.
 
 266
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 The mixture shall conform thereto within the range of tolerances specified for the
 particular mixture. No change in properties or proportion of any component of the jobmix formula shall be made without permission of the Engineer. The job-mix formula for
 each mixture shall be in effect until revised in writing by the Engineer.

 set forth in the Department's Field Manual for HMA.
 The Contractor shall not place any OGFC prior to receiving “tentative” approval and a
 MDOT design number from the Department’s Central Laboratory.
 When a change in source of materials, unsatisfactory mixture production results (such as
 segregation, bleeding, shoving, rutting over ⅛ inch, raveling & cracking) or changed
 conditions make it necessary, a new job-mix formula will be required. The conditions set
 out herein for the original job-mix formula are applicable to the new job-mix formula.

 (f) Stripping Tests. Conduct a minimum of one stripping test at the beginning of
 each job-mix production and thereafter, at least once per each two weeks of
 production according to Mississippi Test Method: MT-63 (as amended) and
 one stripping test per day of production according to Mississippi Test Method:
 MT-59. Should either the TSR (MT-63) or the boiling water (MT-59) stripping
 tests fail, a new antistrip additive or rate shall be established or other changes
 made immediately that will result in a mixture that conforms to the
 specifications; otherwise, production shall be suspended until corrections are
 made.
 (g) Quality Control Charts. Plot the individual test data, the average of the last
 four tests and the control limits for the following items as a minimum:

 (i) Sample Requirements. Obtain the OGFC mixture samples from trucks at the
 plant. Obtain aggregate samples from cold feed bins or aggregate stockpile. Save
 a split portion of all mixture samples at the laboratory site in a dry and protected
 location for 14 calendar days. At the completion of the project, the remaining
 samples may be disposed of with the approval of the Engineer.
 The above testing frequencies are for the estimated plant production for the day. If
 production is discontinued or interrupted, the tests will be conducted at the previously
 established sample tonnage points for the materials that are actually produced. If the
 production exceeds the estimated tonnage, sampling and testing will continue at the
 testing increments previously established for the day. A testing increment is defined as
 the estimated daily tonnage divided by the required number of tests from the table in
 Subsection 402.02.5.3 paragraph (h).
 In addition to the above program, aggregate stockpile gradation tests (AASHTO
 Designations: T-11 and T-27) shall be conducted every other production day. Tests to
 determine VCAdr shall be conducted on the first day of production and once for every
 eight production samples thereafter, with a minimum of one test per production week.
 402.02.5.4--Documentation. The Contractor shall document all observations, records of
 inspection, adjustments to the mixture, and test results on a daily basis. All tests
 conducted by the Contractor in accordance with Subsection 402.02.5.3(g) shall be
 included in the running average calculations. If single tests are performed as a check on
 individual OGFC properties, between regular samples, without performing all tests
 required in Subsection 402.02.5.3(g), the results of those individual tests shall not be
 included in the running average calculations for that particular property. The Contractor
 shall record the results of observations and records of inspection as they occur in a
 permanent field record. The Contractor shall record all process adjustments and job mix
 formula (JMF) changes on the air void charts. The Contractor shall provide copies of all
 test data sheets and the daily summary reports on the appropriate Department forms to the
 Engineer on a daily basis. The Contractor shall provide a written description of any
 process change, including blend proportions, to the Engineer as they occur. Information
 provided to the District Materials Engineer must be received in the Engineer’s office by
 no later than 9:00 AM the day after the OGFC is produced. Upon completion of the
 placement of all OGFC on the project, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with the
 original test reports and control charts in a neat and orderly manner.
 402.02.5.5--Control Limits. The following control limits for the job mix formula (JMF)
 and warning limits are based on a running average of the last four data points.

 402.02.5.6--Warning Bands. Warning bands are defined as the area between the JMF
 limits and the warning limits.
 402.02.5.7--Job Mix Formula Adjustments. A request for a JMF adjustment signed by
 a CAT-II may be made to the Engineer by the Contractor. Sufficient testing data shall be
 submitted with the request to justify the change. The requested change will be reviewed
 by the State Materials Engineer for the Department. If current production values meet
 the mixture design requirements, a revised JMF will be issued. Adjustments to the JMF
 shall conform to the latest edition of the Department’s Field Manual for HMA.
 Adjustments to the JMF to conform to actual production shall not exceed the tolerances
 specified for the JMF limits. Regardless of such tolerances, any adjusted JMF gradation
 shall be within the range given in Subsection 402.02.3.2 for the mixture specified. The
 JMF asphalt content may only be adjusted after verification for minimum voids,
 permeability, and abrasion loss.
 402.02.5.8--Actions and Adjustments. Based on the process control test results for any
 property in question, the following actions shall be taken or adjustments made when
 appropriate:
 (a) When the running average trends toward the warning limits, the Contractor
 shall consider taking corrective action. The corrective action, if any, shall be
 documented. All tests shall be part of the contract files and shall be included in
 the running average calculations.
 (b) The Contractor shall notify the Engineer whenever the running average exceeds
 the warning limits.
 (c) If two consecutive running averages exceed the warning limit, the Contractor
 shall stop production and make adjustments. Production shall only be restarted
 after notifying the Engineer of the adjustments made.
 (d) If the adjustment made under (c) improves the process such that the running
 average after four additional tests is within the warning limits, the Contractor
 may continue production with no reduction in payment.
 (e) If the adjustment made under (c) does not improve the process and the running
 average after four additional tests stays in the warning band, the mixture will be
 considered unsatisfactory. Reduced payment for unsatisfactory mixtures will
 be applied starting from the stop point to the point when the running average is
 back within the warning limits in accordance with Subsection 402.02.6.3.
 (f) Failure to stop production and make adjustments when required shall subject all
 mixture produced from the stop point to the point when the running average is
 back within the warning limits to be considered unsatisfactory. Reduced
 payment for unsatisfactory mixtures will be applied in accordance with
 Subsection 402.02.6.3.
 (g) If the running average exceeds the JMF limits, the Contractor shall stop
 production and make adjustments. Production shall only be restarted after
 notifying the Engineer of the adjustments made.
 (h) All materials for which the running average exceeds the JMF limits will be
 considered unacceptable and shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor
 at no additional cost to the State. The Engineer will determine the quantity of
 material to be replaced based on a review of the individual testing data that
 make up the running average in question and an inspection of the completed
 pavement. If the Engineer decides to leave the mixture in place because of
 
 270
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 special circumstances, the quantity of mixture, as defined above, will be paid
 for in accordance with Subsection 402.02.6.3.
 (i) Single test results shall be compared to 1.7 times the warning and JMF limits.
 If the QC test results, as verified by the Engineer’s tests (within allowable
 differences in Subsection 402.02.6.2), exceed these limits, the pay factor
 provided in Subsection 402.02.6.3 will apply for the quantity of material
 represented by the test(s). Single test limits will be used for the acceptance of
 projects when insufficient tonnage is produced to require four (4) Contractor’s
 tests.
 (j) The above corrective action will also apply for a mixture when the Contractor’s
 testing data has been proven incorrect. The Contractor’s data will be
 considered incorrect when, 1) the Contractor’s QC tests and the Engineer’s
 verification tests do not agree within the allowable differences given in
 Subsection 402.02.6.2 and the difference cannot be resolved, or 2) the
 Engineer’s verification tests indicates that production is outside the JMF limits
 and the results have been substantiated by the Materials Division’s test results.
 The Engineer’s data will be used in place of the Contractor’s data to determine
 the appropriate pay factor.
 402.02.5.9--Trial Section. At the beginning of placement for the lift, the Contractor
 shall construct a trial section of a maximum of a maximum of 250 tons of mix, for the
 purpose of establishing and evaluating consistent mixture and compaction properties.
 The Contractor shall determine the production point at which the mix shall be sampled
 during trial section construction. This sample does not have to be selected by the formal
 random selection procedures used during actual production, but should be representative
 of the mix produced.
 The Contractor (QC) and the Department (QA) will conduct tests for mixture quality. A
 trial section is considered to be successful if the QC test results are within the Warning
 Limits (the testing indicates a pay factor of 1.0) and the QC tests compare to the QA tests
 within the allowable differences set forth in Subsection 402.02.6.2. If the criteria for a
 successful trial section is not achieved, additional trial sections shall be constructed until
 the criteria is achieved, at which time full production can begin. In the event a successful
 trial section is not accomplished by the completion of the second trial section, the
 Contractor will be required to construct additional trial sections at an offsite location.
 The Engineer reserves the right to have any trial section removed and replaced at no
 additional cost to the State, if the pay factor for any characteristic for a trial section is less
 than 0.75.
 For actual payment purposes, a pay factor of 1.00 will be used for the first and second
 trial sections allowed to remain in place. Any required offsite trial sections will be
 constructed at no additional cost to the State.
 402.02.6--Standards of Acceptance.
 402.02.6.1--General. Acceptance for mixture quality (Total voids @ NDesign, gradation,
 and asphalt content) will be based on random samples tested in accordance with the latest
 edition of the Department’s Field Manual for HMA.
 
 271
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 402.02.6.2--Assurance Program for Mixture Quality. The Engineer will conduct a
 quality assurance program. The quality assurance program will be accomplished as
 follows:
 1)
 2)
 3)
 4)
 5)
 
 Conducting verification tests.
 Validate Contractor test results.
 Periodically observing Contractor quality control sampling and testing.
 Monitoring required quality control charts and test results.
 Sampling and testing materials at any time and at any point in the production or
 laydown process.
 
 The rounding of all test results will be in accordance with Subsection 700.04.
 The Engineer will conduct verification tests on samples taken by the Contractor under the
 direct supervision of the Engineer at a time specified by the Engineer. The frequency
 will be equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of the tests required for Contractor
 quality control and the data will be provided to the Contractor within two asphalt mixture
 production days after the sample has been obtained by the Engineer. At least one sample
 shall be tested from the first two days of production. All testing and data analysis shall
 be performed by a Certified Asphalt Technician-I (CAT-I) or by an assistant under the
 direct supervision of the CAT-I. Certification shall be in accordance with the MDOT
 HMA Technician Certification Program chapter in the Materials Division Inspection,
 Testing, and Certification Manual. The Department shall post a chart giving the names
 and telephone numbers for the personnel responsible for the assurance program.
 The Engineer shall be allowed to inspect Contractor testing equipment and equipment
 calibration records to confirm both calibration and condition. The Contractor shall
 calibrate and correlate all testing equipment in accordance with the latest versions of the
 Department's Test Methods and AASHTO R 18.
 Random differences between the Engineer's verification tests and the current running
 average of four quality control tests at the time of obtaining the verification sample will
 be considered acceptable if within the following limits.

 If four quality control tests have not been tested prior to the time of the first verification
 test, the verification test results will be compared to the average of the preceding quality
 control tests. If the verification test is the first material tested on the project or if a
 significant process adjustment was made just prior to the verification test, the verification
 test results will be compared to the average of four subsequent quality control test results.
 For all other cases after a significant process adjustment, the verification test results will
 
 272
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 be compared to the average of the preceding quality control tests, taken after the
 adjustment, as in the case of a new project start-up when four quality control tests are not
 available.
 In the event that, 1) the comparison of the Contractor’s running average quality control
 data and Engineer’s quality assurance verification test results are outside the allowable
 differences in the above table, or 2) if a bias exists between the results, such that one of
 the results is predominately higher or lower than the other, and the Engineer’s results fail
 to meet the JMF control limits, the Engineer will investigate the reason immediately. As
 soon as the need for an investigation becomes known, the Engineer will increase the
 quality assurance sampling rate to the same frequency required for Contractor testing.
 The additional samples obtained by the Engineer may be used as part of the investigation
 process or for routine quality assurance verification tests. The Engineer's investigation
 may include testing of the remaining quality control split samples, review and
 observation of the Contractor's testing procedures and equipment, and a comparison of
 split sample test results by the Contractor quality control laboratory, Department quality
 assurance laboratory and the Materials Division laboratory. The procedures outlined in
 the latest edition of the Department’s Field Manual for HMA may be used as a guide for
 the investigation. In the event that the Contractor’s results are determined to be incorrect,
 the Engineer's results will be used for the quality control data and the appropriate
 payment for the mixture will be based on the procedures specified in Subsection
 402.02.5.8(j).
 The Engineer will periodically witness the sampling and testing being performed by the
 Contractor. The Engineer, both verbally and in writing, will promptly notify the
 Contractor of any observed deficiencies. When differences exist between the Contractor
 and the Engineer that cannot be resolved, a decision will be made by the State Materials
 Engineer, acting as the referee. The Contractor will be promptly notified in writing of the
 decision. If the deficiencies are not corrected, the Engineer will stop production until
 corrective action is taken.
 402.02.6.3--Acceptance Procedure for Mixture Quality. All obviously defective
 material or mixture will be subject to rejection by the Engineer. Such defective material
 or mixture shall not be incorporated into the finished work. If the defective material has
 already been placed in the work, the material shall be removed and replaced at no
 additional cost to the State.
 The Engineer will base final acceptance of the asphalt mixture production on the results of
 the Contractor's testing for total voids, gradation, and asphalt content as verified by the
 Engineer in the manner described and the uniformity and condition of the completed
 pavement. Areas of pavement that exhibit nonuniformity or failures (materials or
 construction related) such as but not limited to segregation, bleeding, shoving, rutting over
 1/8”, raveling, slippage, or cracking will not be accepted. Such areas will be removed and
 replaced at no additional cost to the State.
 Bituminous mixture placed prior to correction for deficiencies in total voids @ NDesign,
 gradation, or asphalt content, as required in Subsection 402.02.5.8 and determined by the
 Engineer satisfactory to remain in place will be paid for in accordance with the following
 pay factors times the contract unit price per ton.

 402.02.7--Acceptance Procedure for OGFC Pavement Smoothness. The OGFC will
 not be considered a surface lift in the completed pavement structure. There shall be no
 smoothness requirement for OGFC pavements. However, all transverse joints in or
 abutting the OGFC shall meet a tolerance of 1/8” or less when checked using a 10-foot
 straight edge.
 402.03--Construction Requirements. The Department has adopted the “Hot-Mix
 Asphalt Paving Handbook” as the guideline for acceptable asphalt construction practices.
 402.03.1--Specific Requirements.
 402.03.1.1--Weather Limitations. The mixture shall not be placed when weather
 conditions prevent the proper handling and finishing or the surface on which it is to be
 placed is wet or frozen. At the time of placement, the air and pavement surface
 temperature limitations shall be equal to or exceed 55F and rising. OGFC placement
 should be avoided when the paving window, based on temperature, is limited
 When paving operations are discontinued because of rain, the mixture in transit shall be
 protected until the rain ceases. The surface on which the mixture is to be placed shall be
 swept to remove as much moisture as possible and the mixture may then be placed
 subject to removal and replacement at no additional cost to the State if contract
 requirements are not met.
 402.03.1.2--Tack Coat. Tack coat for OGFC shall be one from the Department’s APL
 under the category “Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC) Asphalt Tack Materials.” PG
 76-22 binder shall meet the requirements of Section 702 of the Standard Specifications.
 Tack Coat for OGFC shall be applied with a distributor spray bar at the applied rate of
 between 0.10 and 0.14 gallons per square yard. The application rate of the tack coat shall
 result in complete and uniform coverage of the underlying lift in which the OGFC will be
 placed.
 The tack coat for OGFC should be allowed to break, cool and/or cure until a point in time
 that the tack coat does not pick-up or track due to traffic from trucks or the paving
 equipment. It should be pointed out that breaking, cooling, and/or curing times of the
 tack coat may vary based on the environmental conditions at the time of placement.
 402.03.2--Bituminous Mixing Plants.
 402.03.2.1--Plant Requirements.
 
 274
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 402.03.2.1.1--Cold Aggregate Storage. The cold storage for hydrated lime shall be a
 separate bulk storage bin with a vane feeder or other approved feeder system that can
 readily be calibrated. The system shall provide a means for easy sampling of the
 hydrated lime additive and verifying the quantity of lime dispensed. The feeder system
 shall require a totalizer.
 The hydrated lime additive equipment shall be interlocked and synchronized with the
 cold feed controls to operate concurrently with the cold feed operation that will
 automatically adjust the hydrated lime feed to variations in the cold aggregate feed. A
 positive signal system shall be installed that will automatically shut the plant down when
 malfunctions cause an improper supply of hydrated lime or water.
 The plant shall not operate unless the entire hydrated lime system is functioning properly.
 402.03.2.1.2--Cold Aggregate Feed. The hydrated lime shall be dispensed dry or as a
 slurry (1 part hydrated lime to 3 parts water) directly onto the composite aggregate
 between the cold feed and the dryer.
 When hydrated lime is introduced dry, a spray bar or other approved system capable of
 spraying all aggregate with water shall be installed in order to maintain all aggregate at
 the moisture condition set out in Subsection 402.02.3.1 prior to addition of the hydrated
 lime. An alternate system for spraying the coarse aggregate stockpiles may be allowed
 when approved by the Engineer. The approved equipment and methods shall consistently
 maintain the aggregate in a uniform, surface wet condition. The moisture content of the
 aggregate-hydrated lime mixture, following spraying and mixing, shall be introduced into
 the automatic moisture controls of the plant.
 The aggregate-hydrated lime mixture shall be uniformly blended by some mechanical
 means such as a motorized "on the belt" mixer or pug mill located between the cold feed
 and the dryer. Other mixing devices may be used subject to approval by the Engineer.
 A maximum of forty five (45) percent of the total aggregate blend may be fed through
 any single cold feed bin. If the JMF calls for more than forty five (45) percent of a
 specific aggregate, that aggregate must be fed through two (2) or more separate cold feed
 bins.
 402.03.2.1.3--Dryer. The efficiency of drying aggregates shall be such that the moisture
 content of an OGFC mixture shall not exceed 0.50 percent by weight of the total mixture,
 and the moisture content of any underlying lifts shall not exceed 0.75 percent by weight
 of the total mixture being produced.
 402.03.2.1.4--Stabilizing Fiber Addition. For batch plants, fibers shall be added
 (manually or automatic) to either the pugmill or the weigh hopper. At least one aggregate
 source shall be added prior to the fiber addition, if fibers are added to the weigh hopper.
 Otherwise, fibers shall be added to the pugmill immediately after the addition of all the
 aggregate and prior to the addition of the asphalt binder.
 402.03.2.1.4.1--Manual Method. Provided it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer that the proper dosage rate of the stabilizing fibers is uniformly distributed into
 the mix, manual introduction of the fibers is acceptable when a batch plant is used to
 make the mix. When the fibers are available in prepackaged (weighed) containers,
 
 275
 
 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 proper dosage may be pre-determined per batch. A device is required to interrupt
 mixture production and warn the plant operator if the operator manually feeding the fiber
 fails to introduce it properly.
 Manual introduction of fibers shall not be used in drum plants.
 402.03.2.1.4.2--Automatic Method.
 The automatic method requires specialized
 equipment that can accurately proportion and meter, by weight, the proper amount per
 batch for batch plants, or continuously and in a steady uniform manner for drum plants.
 Fiber, pelletized or loose, shall not be fed through the cold feed bins or through the RAP
 bins.
 These proportioning devices shall be interlocked with the plant system and controlled to
 10 percent of the weight of the fibers required so as to maintain the correct proportions
 for all production rates and batch sizes. During trial section construction, an equipment
 calibration check shall be performed to the satisfaction of the Engineer that shows the
 fiber is being accurately metered and uniformly distributed into the mix. These metering
 devices shall provide in- process high flow (>10 percent or more) and low flow (<10
 percent or less) plant operator notification and interrupt the mix production where the
 fiber rate is not properly controlled. The fiber metering system shall also provide a
 record of feed rate (weight per time) and include a minimum two-foot long section of
 translucent pipe for visual confirmation of consistent flow rates. Care shall be taken to
 ensure that the fibers are not entrained in the plant’s exhaust system. If there is any
 evidence of fiber in the bag-house or wet-washer fines, the liquid asphalt binder line
 and/or the fiber line shall be relocated so that the fiber is captured by liquid asphalt binder
 spray and incorporated into the mix. If there is any evidence of clumps of fibers or
 pellets at the discharge chute, the contractor shall increase the mixing time and/or
 intensity. This may entail extending the liquid asphalt binder and fiber feeding lines
 further into the drum.
 Note: Various stabilizing fiber suppliers have developed methodology and equipment for
 metering bulk loose and pelletized fiber into asphalt plants. Whenever the fiber
 supplier’s recommendations are more stringent than this specification, the fiber supplier’s
 recommendations shall control.
 402.03.2.1.5--Control of Bituminous Material and Antistripping Agent. Specified
 bituminous materials from different manufacturers or from different refineries of a single
 manufacturer shall not be mixed in the plant's asphalt cement supply system storage tank
 and used in the work without prior written approval of the Engineer. Approval is
 contingent upon the Engineer's receipt of three copies of the manufacturer's certified test
 report(s) from the Contractor showing that the bituminous material blend conforms to the
 specifications.
 A satisfactory method of weighing or metering shall be provided to ensure the specified
 quantity of bituminous material. Provisions shall be provided for checking the quantity
 or rate of flow. Weighing or metering devices shall be accurate within plus or minus onehalf percent.
 The antistripping agent shall be injected into the bituminous material immediately prior
 to the mixing operation with an approved in-line injector system capable of being
 calibrated so as to ensure the prescribed dosage.

 An in-line spigot for sampling of asphalt shall be located between the asphalt storage tank
 and the antistripping agent in-line injector.
 402.03.2.1.6--Thermometric Equipment. An armored thermometer of adequate range
 and calibrated in 5°F increments shall be fixed at a suitable location in the bituminous
 line near the charging valve of the mixer unit.
 The plant shall be equipped with an approved dial-scale, mercury-actuated thermometer,
 pyrometer or other approved thermometric instrument placed at the discharge chute of the
 dryer to measure the temperature of the material.
 When the temperature control is unsatisfactory, the Engineer may require an approved
 temperature-recording apparatus for better regulation of the temperature.
 402.03.2.1.7--Screens. A 1-inch scalping screen shall be used.
 402.03.2.1.8--Dust Collector. The plant shall be equipped with a dust collector
 constructed to waste or return collected material. When collected material is returned, it
 shall be returned through a controlling device that will provide a uniform flow of material
 into the aggregate mixture.
 402.03.2.1.9--Safety Requirements. A platform or other suitable device shall be
 provided so the Engineer will have access to the truck bodies for sampling and mixture
 temperature data.
 402.03.2.1.10--Blank.

 commercial weighing and measuring devices as recommended by the National Bureau of
 Standards [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 44] shall
 govern truck scales used in the State of Mississippi, except weighing devices with a
 capacity of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or more used to weigh road construction
 materials (i.e. sand, gravel, asphalt, fill dirt, topsoil and concrete) shall have a tolerance
 of one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) in lieu of the requirements of Handbook 44 and
 shall be regulated by the Department.
 Scales shall be checked and certified by a scale company certified in heavy truck weights
 by the MDAC. In the case of scales used for measurement of materials on Department of
 Transportation projects, certification shall be performed in the presence of an authorized
 representative of the Department or a copy of the certification may be furnished for scales
 that have been checked and certified within the last six months for use on other
 Department projects and are still in the position where previously tested. Scales that have
 not been checked and certified under NIST Handbook 44 guidelines, except for the herein
 modified tolerances allowed, shall be so checked and certified prior to use for
 measurement of materials on Department of Transportation projects. Tests shall be
 continued on six month intervals with the test conducted in the presence of an authorized
 representative of the Department.
 Truck scales shall be accurate to one-half of one percent of the applied load, shall be
 sensitive to 20 pounds, and shall have a graduation of not more than 20 pounds.

 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 The Contractor may use an electronic weighing system approved by the Engineer in lieu
 of truck scales. The system shall be equipped with an automatic print out system that
 will print a ticket for each load with the following information:
 MDOT, Contractor’s name, project number, county, ticket number, load number, pay
 item number, item description of the material delivered, date, time of day, haul
 vehicle number, gross weight, tare weight, net weight and total daily net weight.
 When approved by the Engineer and materials are measured directly from a storage bin
 equipped with load cells, exceptions may be made to the gross and tare weight
 requirements.
 The ticket shall also have a place for recording the temperature of OGFC mixtures, if
 applicable, and the signatures of the Department’s plant and roadway inspectors. The
 load numbers for each project shall begin with load number one (1) for the first load of
 the day and shall be numbered consecutively without a break until the last load of the
 day. The Contractor shall provide the Department with an original and one copy of each
 ticket. When the ticket information provided by the Contractor proves to be
 unsatisfactory, the Department will use imprinter(s) and imprinter tickets to record load
 information. All recorded weights shall be in pounds and shall be accurate to within onehalf of one percent of the true weight, and the system shall be sensitive to 20 pounds.
 The Engineer may require random loads to be checked on certified platform scales at no
 cost to the Department. If the electronic scales are found to be inaccurate, a recertification of the scales shall be performed before the Contractor can continue use of
 the scales.
 When an electronic weighing system utilizes the plant scales of a batch plant, the system
 may be used only in conjunction with a fully automatic batching and control system.
 402.03.2.2--Additional Requirements for Batching Plants.
 402.03.2.2.1--Plant Scales. The plant batch scale weight shall not exceed the platform
 scale weight by more than one percent (1%).
 402.03.2.3--Additional Requirements for Drum Mixing Plants.
 402.03.2.3.1--Plant Controls. The plant shall be operated with all the automatic controls
 as designed and provided by the plant manufacturer. If the automatic controls
 malfunction, brief periods of manual operations to complete the day’s work or to protect
 the work already placed may be conducted with the approval of the Engineer. During
 manual operation, the Contractor must continue to produce a uniform mixture meeting all
 contract requirements.
 402.03.2.3.2--Aggregate Handling and Proportioning. A screening unit shall be
 placed between the bins and the mixer to remove oversized aggregate, roots, clayballs,
 etc.

 Section 402
 
 Section 402
 
 may be stored for a period not to exceed three hours in a well-sealed, well-insulated,
 heated bin.
 402.03.3--Hauling Equipment. The inside surfaces of each vehicle bed shall be coated
 with a light application of water and thin oil, soap solution, lime water solution or other
 approved material to prevent the mixture from sticking. Diesel fuel or gasoline shall not
 be used to lubricate vehicle beds. Truck beds shall be raised to drain excessive lubricants
 before placing mixture in the bed. An excess of lubricant will not be permitted.
 402.03.4--Asphalt Mixture Pavers. The screed shall be capable of vibrating and heating
 the full width of the mixture being placed and shall lay the lift with an automatic control
 device to the specified slope and grade without tearing, pulling or gouging the mixture
 surface. Rigid screed and auger extensions should be used when the width of the screed
 is not adequate to pave a full lane width or full paved width (lane width plus shoulder
 width). Typically, the end of the auger extension should extend to approximately 18
 inches or less from the end plate to ensure uniform mixture placement. Strike-off
 extensions should not be used for OGFC placement
 402.03.5--Rollers. All rollers shall be self-propelled units capable of maintaining a
 smooth and uniform forward and reverse speed as required for proper compaction.
 Pneumatic-tired rollers shall not be permitted for compacting OGFC mixes. Rollers shall
 be equipped with adjustable scrapers, water tanks, mats and a device for wetting the
 wheels to prevent the mixture from sticking. Adhesion of the mixture to the rollers will
 not be permitted. The use of diesel fuel or gasoline for cleaning roller wheels, or to aid in
 preventing the mixture from sticking to the wheels, is prohibited.
 All rollers shall be in good mechanical condition, free from leaking fuels and lubricants,
 loose link motion, faulty steering mechanism, worn king bolts and bearings. They shall
 be operational at slow speeds to avoid displacement of the mixture and capable of
 reversing direction smoothly and without backlash.
 402.03.6--Preparation of Grade. The foundation upon which OGFC pavement is to be
 placed shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable Section of the Standard
 Specifications.
 Unless otherwise directed, tack coat shall be applied to the underlying surface on which
 the mixture is to be placed. Emulsions, if used, must be allowed to "break" prior to
 placement of the bituminous mixture.
 Bituminous mixture shall not be placed against the edge of pavements, curbs, gutters,
 manholes and other structures until the edges located adjacent to the asphalt layer to be
 placed are sprayed with a thin uniform tack coating. The tack coat shall be protected
 until the mixture has been placed.
 Existing pavements that require preliminary leveling or patching in advance of placing
 the OGFC mixture shall be sprayed with a tack coat material and then brought as nearly
 as practicable to uniform grade and cross section. The material shall be placed by hand
 or machine in one or more compacted layers approximately two (2) inches or less in
 compacted thickness.
 402.03.7--Blank.

 402.03.8--Preparation of Mixture. The temperature of the mixture, when discharged
 from the mixer, shall not exceed 340°F.
 402.03.9--Material Transfer Equipment. Except for the areas mentioned below, the
 material transferred from the hauling unit shall be remixed prior to being placed in the
 paver hopper or insert by using an approved Materials Transfer Device. Information on
 approved devices can be obtained from the State Construction Engineer. Areas excluded
 from this requirement include: temporary work of short duration, detours, bridge
 replacement projects having less than 1,000 feet of pavement on each side of the
 structure, acceleration and deceleration lanes less than 1,000 feet in length, tapered
 sections, transition sections (for width), shoulders less than 10 feet in width, crossovers,
 ramps, side street returns and other areas designated by the Engineer.
 402.03.10--Spreading and Finishing. The mixture shall be spread to the depth and
 width that will provide the specified compacted thickness, line, grade and cross section.
 Placing of the mixture shall be as continuous as possible. On areas where mechanical
 spreading and finishing is impracticable, the mixture may be spread, raked and luted by
 hand tools.
 Immediately after screeding and prior to compaction, the surface shall be checked by the
 Contractor and irregularities adjusted. When the edge is feathered as in a wedge lift, it
 may be sealed by rolling. Irregularities in alignment and grade along the edges shall be
 corrected before the edges are rolled.
 Hauling, spreading and finishing equipment shall be furnished that is capable of and
 operated in such a manner that the rolling operation will satisfactorily correct any surface
 blemishes.
 The longitudinal joint in the subsequent lift shall offset that in the underlying lift by
 approximately six (6) inches. However, the joint in the top lift shall be at the centerline
 or lane line.
 402.03.11--Roadway Compaction. Compaction shall be achieved by two to three passes
 of a 10 to 12-ton steel wheel roller operating in static mode. Finish rolling to remove any
 roller marks shall be performed after the mat temperature decreases to 250°F.
 402.03.12--Joints. Joints between previously placed pavement and pavement being
 placed shall be so formed as to ensure thorough and continuous bond.
 The contact surface of longitudinal joints, except hot joints, shall be sprayed with a thin
 uniform tack coating before additional mixture is placed against the previously placed

 SECTION 403 - ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 403.01--Description. This work consists of constructing one or more lifts of asphalt
 pavement meeting the requirements of Section 401 on a prepared surface in accordance
 with the requirements of this section and in reasonably close conformity with the lines,
 grades, thicknesses, and typical cross sections shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer. This work shall also include applicable in-grade preparation of the underlying
 course in accordance with Section 321.
 The Contractor must select one of the asphalt mixture processes (HMA or WMA) to be
 used on this project.
 403.02--Material Requirements. Materials and their use shall conform to the applicable
 requirements of Subsection 401.02.
 403.03--Construction Requirements.
 403.03.1--General. Construction requirements shall be as specified in Subsection
 401.03, except as otherwise indicated in this section or applicable special provisions.
 403.03.2--Smoothness Tolerances. Except as noted herein, the finished smoothness of
 each lift shall conform to the designated grade and cross section within the following
 tolerances from grade stakes or other grade reference points set at 25-foot intervals:

 Section 403
 
 Note: Where more than four (4) lifts of asphalt are required, all lifts, excluding the top
 three (3) lifts, shall meet the requirements of the lower lift.
 * When tested longitudinally from a stringline located equidistant above points 50
 feet apart, the distance from the stringline to the surface at any two points
 located 12½ feet apart shall not vary one from the other more than the maximum
 deviation allowed above from a 10-foot straight edge.
 Grade stakes or other grade reference points set at 25-foot intervals and maximum
 deviation from grade and cross section will not be required provided an approved profile
 averaging device is furnished and properly used for the four conditions set forth herein;
 however, all other surface requirements are applicable.
 (a) Overlays with one overall lift.
 (b) Overlays with two or more overall lifts -- for each lift above the first overall lift
 provided each underlying overall lift is within the allowable tolerances.
 (c) Surface lift of new construction provided the underlying lift is within the
 allowable tolerances.
 (d) Full-depth asphalt construction for lifts above the lower lift provided the lower
 lift is within the specified tolerances for the lower intermediate lift.
 In the placement of full depth asphalt pavement, where the chemically treated base is
 constructed, graded and/or trimmed, full lane width, to a surface tolerance of ±3/8 inches
 from design grade, stringline grade controls may be eliminated for the placement of the
 asphalt drainage course and all asphalt lifts. In addition, where the base course is crushed
 stone or crushed concrete and is constructed to a surface tolerance of ±3/8 inches from
 design grade using a stringline controlled spreader, stringline grade controls may be
 eliminated for the placement of the asphalt drainage course and all asphalt lifts.
 All other tolerances as specified in Section 321 are applicable, except for bases, when
 tested longitudinally, the maximum deviation when measured at the 12½-foot midpoint
 shall be ±3/8 inches.
 Acceptance and payment of asphalt will be determined on a lot to lot basis by cores taken
 from the completed pavement as outlined in Subsection 403.03.3.
 Approved contacting type profile averaging devices are those devices capable of working
 in conjunction with a taut string or wire set to grade, or ski-type device with extreme
 contact points with the surface at least 30 feet apart. Approved non-contacting type
 profile averaging devices are laser type ski devices with at least four referencing mobile
 stations at a minimum length of 24 feet, or an approved equal.
 When approved by the Engineer, a short ski or shoe may be substituted for a long ski on
 the second paving operation working in tandem.
 During the finishing and compacting of pavement lifts, it shall be the responsibility of the
 Contractor to check the surface and joints for progress toward conformance to surface
 requirements set forth herein. Variations from surface requirements exceeding the
 allowable tolerances shall be corrected at the Contractor's expense.
 
 282
 
 Section 403
 
 Section 403
 
 When a portland cement concrete pavement is to be placed on an asphalt lift, the finished
 top of the asphalt lift shall meet the requirements of Sections 32l and 50l.
 Sections(s) or portions thereof representing areas excluded from a smoothness test with
 the High Speed Inertial Profiling System (IPS) shall also be excluded from consideration
 for a contract price adjustment for rideability.
 Any contract price adjustment for rideability will be applied on a continuous basis to the
 pay tonnage, determined in accordance with Subsections 401.02.6.8 and 403.04, for the
 section(s) or portions thereof for which an adjustment is warranted.
 Contract price adjustments for rideability shall only be applicable to the surface lift and
 furthermore to only the long continuous section(s) or portions of the long continuous
 section(s) of the surface lift that require smoothness be determined by using a profiling
 device.
 403.03.2.1--Smoothness Tolerances for Mean Roughness Index (MRI). Smoothness
 tolerances shall be applied to asphalt pavements based on the following pavement
 categories.
 Category A applies to the following pavement constructions:
 
 
 
 
 New construction
 Construction with three (3) or more lifts
 Mill and two (2) or more lifts
 
 Category B applies to the following pavement constructions:
 
 
 
 Mill and one (1) lift
 Two (2) lift overlays without milling
 
 Category C applies to the following pavement constructions:
 
 
 
 Single lift overlay without milling
 All 57,650-pound routes regardless of the pavement construction
 
 Additional projects may qualify for Category C construction at the Department’s
 discretion. Spot leveling / preliminary leveling does not count as a lift. Full width /
 continuous leveling courses that have a minimum thickness of ¾” across the entire lane
 width will be considered a lift.
 Category A projects shall have a long continuous interval (528-foot) surface MRI of not
 more than 60 inches per mile.
 Category B projects shall have a long continuous interval (528-foot) surface MRI of not
 more than 70 inches per mile.
 Category C projects shall have the existing surface profiled at no additional cost to the
 State. These projects shall be measured by a long fixed interval (528-foot) surface MRI
 and meet the higher value of the following requirements:
 
 283
 
 Section 403
 
 Section 403
 
 A 50% improvement in MRI from the existing surface
 or
 80 inches per mile
 In the case that 50% of the existing surface MRI is greater than 80 inches per mile, the
 short continuous threshold shall be increased from 160 inches per mile by the difference
 between 50% of the existing surface MRI and 80 inches per mile.
 For all projects, areas of the surface lift with localized roughness greater than 160 inches
 per mile as determined by the continuous short interval (25’) report will be identified for
 correction by the Project Engineer.
 When a project has multiple lifts, the lift underlying the surface lift shall have a MRI of
 no more than 10 inches/mile more than the surface lift threshold for both long and short
 continuous intervals. Category B projects containing multiple lifts must meet the
 Category C percent improvement requirement for the underlying lift. Corrective action
 must be taken on those segments that do not meet this requirement. No unit price
 adjustment will be applied on any underlying lift.
 For Category A and B projects, a unit price increase will be added when the MRI for the
 final surface lift, prior to any required localized roughness (short interval) corrective
 action, is less than or equal to fifty inches per mile (50.0 inches / mile) on the long
 interval report. These Projects will be considered for incentive pay based on the
 following guidelines for the long interval surface lift MRI.

 Segment(s) or portions thereof representing areas excluded from a smoothness test shall
 also be excluded from consideration for a contract price adjustment for rideability.
 Where a segment less than 528 feet occurs at the end of a section, it will be combined
 with the preceding 528-foot segment for calculation of MRI. Corrective action must be
 taken on those sections that exceed the ‘Remove and Replace’ threshold as directed by
 the Project Engineer. The minimum remove and replace length will be 528 feet (0.1
 mile). Additional smoothness testing shall be required on sections following replacement
 and will be required to meet at least the maximum surface MRI short of ‘Remove and
 Replace’ tolerance.
 The above pay factors will be applied in conjunction with the Long Continuous
 Histogram Chart from ProVAL’s Smoothness Assurance Module. The price adjustments
 for rideability will be tabulated in the Department’s Pay Incentive spreadsheet on the
 basis of a theoretical tonnage of 110 lbs/yd2 * inch thickness (pounds per square yard *
 inch thickness) determined in accordance with Subsections 401.02.6.8 and 403.04, for
 the segment(s) or portions thereof for which an adjustment is warranted.
 403.03.3--Thickness Requirements. Asphalt overlay lifts shall be constructed as nearly
 in accordance with the thickness shown on the plans as the underlying pavement and
 foundation will permit. Periodic and cumulative yield tests will be made to determine
 practicable conformity to the thickness of each lift. The Engineer may order
 modifications in placement thicknesses to prevent unwarranted variations in plan
 quantities.
 When the paver is operating off an established grade line, no thickness determination will
 be required for the various lifts of pavement. It is understood that the tolerances from
 design grade will control the thickness requirements.
 When grade stakes are eliminated by Notice to Bidders or as outlined in Subsection
 403.03.2(d) and where resulting in the placement of two (2) or more lifts, acceptance and
 payment will be determined on a lot to lot basis by cores taken from the completed
 pavement. Lots will be coincidental with acceptance lots for the surface lift as provided
 in Subsection 401.02.6.4, except that only lots resulting from the placement of mainline
 surface lift will be used for thickness assessment. One core will be obtained at random
 from each lot. Irregular areas will not be cored.
 
 285
 
 Section 403
 
 Section 403
 
 When the average thickness of all the cores from the lots representing a day’s production,
 excluding any discarded by the Engineer for justifiable reason, is within three-eighths of
 an inch (3/8”) of the total pavement thickness shown on the plans, excluding lift(s) placed
 using an established grade line, corrective action will not be required and a price
 adjustment will not be made for non-conformity to specified thickness.
 When the average thickness of all the cores from the lots representing a day’s production
 is deficient in thickness by more than three eights of an inch (3/8”) of the total pavement
 thickness shown on the plans, excluding lift(s) placed using an established grade line, the
 deficiency shall be corrected by overlaying the entire length of the day’s production. The
 thickness of the overlay shall be equal to the thickness deficiency but no less than the
 minimum single lift laying thickness for the specified mixture.
 When the thickness of all the cores from the lots representing a day’s production is more
 than three eights of an inch (3/8”) thicker than the total thickness shown on the plans,
 excluding lift(s) placed using an established grade line, a price adjustment will be made
 in accordance with Subsection 403.05.1.
 The cores shall be cut and removed by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer's
 representative and turned over to the Engineer’s representative for further handling. The
 Contractor shall fill each core hole with surface lift mixture and compact to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer within 24 hours after coring.
 403.03.4--Lift Corrections. Pavement exceeding the allowable surface tolerances shall
 be corrected at the Contractor's expense by the following methods:
 Lower, Leveling and Lower Intermediate Lifts:
 (a) Removal or addition of mixture by skin patching, feather edging, wedge lift
 construction or full depth patching where appropriate and can be completed in a
 satisfactory manner.
 (b) Superimposing an additional layer that shall be an approved grade raise for the
 full roadway width and length of the area to be corrected.
 Top Intermediate Lift:
 (a) Removal and the addition of sufficient mixture to provide the specified
 thickness. Corrections by this method shall be square or rectangular in shape
 and shall completely cover the area to be corrected.
 (b) Superimposing an additional layer of minimum lift thickness for mixture being
 used that shall be an approved grade raise for full roadway width of the area to
 be corrected. Transverse joints shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the
 pavement.
 Surface Lift:
 (a) Removal and the addition of sufficient mixture to provide new material of at
 least minimum single lift laying thickness for full lane width of the area to be
 corrected. Transverse joints shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the lane.
 (b) Superimposing an additional layer (minimum lift thickness for mixture being
 used) that shall be an approved grade raise for full roadway width of the area to
 
 286
 
 Section 403
 
 Section 403
 
 be corrected. Transverse joints shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the
 pavement.
 All mixtures used in the correction of unacceptable pavement shall be approved by the
 Engineer prior to use.
 403.03.5--Overlays or Widening and Overlays. In addition to the requirements of
 Subsections 403.03.1 through 403.03.4, the following requirements will be applicable
 when an existing pavement is to be overlaid or widened and overlaid.
 403.03.5.1--Blank.
 403.03.5.2--Sequence of Operations. In order to expedite the safe movement of traffic
 and to protect each phase of the work as it is performed, a firm sequence of operations is
 essential. Unless otherwise provided in the traffic control plan and/or the contract, the
 following appropriate items of work shall be begun and continually prosecuted in the
 order listed:
 (a) In sections designated by the Engineer, trim the shoulders along the pavement
 edges to provide drainage from the pavement.
 (b) Perform pre-rolling to locate areas of pavement with excessive movement per
 Section 511.
 (c) Perform selective undercutting and patching as directed per Subsection
 403.03.5.4.
 (d) Perform pressure grouting as specified in Section 512.
 (e) Clean and seal joints per Section 413.
 (f) Complete preparation on one side of roadway to be widened and place
 widening materials.
 (g) Reconstruct shoulders to elevation necessary to assure traffic safety.
 (h) Open the widened section to traffic.
 (i) Complete above work for other side of roadway.

 (p) Place remaining intermediate lift, if required.
 (q) Place surface lift.
 (r) Complete construction of shoulders.
 (s) Apply permanent traffic marking.
 (t) Final cleanup.
 The above operations shall be performed in such a manner that traffic will be maintained
 on a paved surface at all times. Two-lane, two-way highways should not be restricted to

 backfilled with granular material or asphalt as directed.
 Except as provided herein, excavation for widening, undercutting or other required
 excavation shall be spread along the edge of the shoulders, foreslopes or other adjacent
 areas as directed and will be an absorbed item. When the quantity is in excess of what
 may be used satisfactorily on adjacent areas, the Engineer may direct that the material be
 loaded, hauled and spread uniformly on other designated areas. In this case,
 compensation for handling surplus material will be in accordance with the appropriate
 pay items as provided in the contract or as extra work.
 If the plans require widening of the shoulders or embankment with Contractor furnished
 material, all suitable material obtained from widening excavation may be used and will
 be measured and paid for as Contractor furnished materials. No measurement for
 payment of haul will be made.
 Removal and disposal of old stakes, forms and other debris encountered in excavating
 shall be in accordance with Section 201 and shall be considered as incidental to and
 included in the unit prices bid for other items. No separate measurement will be made
 therefor. Pavement edges and surfaces shall be cleaned prior to final shaping and
 compaction of adjacent trenching or undercut areas.
 Granular material for widening shall be placed on a previously prepared, smooth, firm
 and unyielding foundation in accordance with the typical section. Density of the granular
 material shall be as specified.
 Asphalt for widening, including trench widening, shall meet the applicable requirements
 of Section 401, Section 403, and shall be placed in one or more layers as shown on the
 plans or directed. The surface of the mixture shall be finished as a continuation of the
 adjacent pavement slope.

 granular material and bituminous mixtures for widening when standard width rolling
 equipment cannot be used.
 403.03.5.4--Patching. Existing pavement that has failed or unsatisfactorily stabilized
 shall be removed as directed. Removal of pavement will be measured and paid for under
 the appropriate pay items as provided in the contract.
 Backfill shall consist of asphalt or a combination of compacted layers of aggregate
 material and asphalt. Unless otherwise specified, the Engineer will make this
 determination based on depth and field conditions.
 Asphalt used for backfilling will be measured and paid for at the contract unit price for
 the mixture designated on the plans as the lowest lift. Aggregate will be measured and
 paid for under the appropriate pay item as provided in the contract or as extra work.
 403.03.5.5--Preliminary Leveling. All localized irregularities of the existing pavement,
 such as ruts, cross-slope deficiencies, etc., shall be corrected by spot leveling, skin
 patching, feather edging or a wedge lift in advance of placing the first overall lift.

 403.03.5.6--Placement of Lifts. The leveling lift shall be placed in a layer, or layers, not
 exceeding approximately two and one-half inches compacted thickness.
 When single lane construction is required, placement of a lift on the adjacent lane may be
 performed by an approved profile averaging device provided the lane previously placed is
 within the allowable tolerances for all surface requirements. When any of the tolerances
 are exceeded, the Contractor shall reestablish the control stringline for laying the adjacent
 lane should the Contractor elect to perform this work prior to correcting the deficiencies
 of the lane previously placed. In no case shall a "matching shoe" be used to control the
 grade of an adjacent lane.
 In instances where there are only minor deviations from the allowable tolerances in the
 first overall lift, the Engineer may permit the Contractor to place the next higher lift by
 graded stringline in lieu of making the corrections.
 Single lane placement of leveling, intermediate and surface lifts shall be limited to the
 distance covered in one and one-half days in advance of that placed in the adjacent lane.
 403.03.5.7--Protection of Pavement. The pavement shall be protected and properly

 405.02.5.6-- Warning Bands. Warning bands are defined as the area between the JMF
 limits and the warning limits.
 405.02.5.7--Job Mix Formula Adjustments. A request for a JMF adjustment signed by
 a CAT-II may be made to the Engineer by the Contractor. Sufficient testing data shall be
 submitted with the request to justify the change. The requested change will be reviewed
 by the State Materials Engineer for the Department. If current production values meet
 the mixture design requirements, a revised JMF will be issued. Adjustments to the JMF
 shall conform to the latest edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA. Adjustments to
 the JMF to conform to actual production shall not exceed the tolerances specified for the
 JMF limits. Regardless of such tolerances, any adjusted JMF gradation shall be within
 the range given in Subsection 405.02.1.2.3 for the mixture specified. The JMF asphalt
 content may only be reduced if the production VMA meets or exceeds the minimum
 design VMA requirements for the mixture being produced.
 405.02.5.8--Actions and Adjustments. Actions and adjustments shall be as required in
 Subsection 401.02.5.8.
 405.02.5.9--Trial Section. At the beginning of placement for each lift, the Contractor
 shall construct a trial section of a maximum of 400 tons of mix, for the purpose of
 establishing and evaluating consistent mixture properties and the compactibility of the
 mixture. The Contractor shall determine the production point at which the mix shall be
 sampled during trial section construction. This sample does not have to be selected by
 the formal random selection procedures used during actual production, but should be
 representative of the mix produced.
 Density tests shall be performed according to the procedures in Chapter 7 of MDOT’s
 Field Manual for Hot Mix Asphalt (First Day Production). The Contractor (QC) and the
 Department (QA) will conduct tests for mixture quality. A trial section is considered to
 be successful if the QC test results are within the Warning Limits (the testing indicates a
 pay factor of 1.0) and the QC tests compare to the QA tests within the allowable
 differences set forth in Subsection 401.02.6.2. If the criteria for a successful trial section
 is not achieved, additional trial sections of at least 200 tons but not more than 400 tons
 shall be constructed until the criteria is achieved, at which time full production can begin.
 In the event a successful trial section is not accomplished by the completion of the second
 trial section, the Contractor will be required to construct additional trial sections at an
 offsite location. The Engineer reserves the right to have any trial section removed and
 replaced at no additional cost to the State, if the pay factor for any characteristic for a trial
 section is less than 0.75.
 For actual payment purposes, a pay factor of 1.00 will be used for all first and second
 trial sections allowed to remain in place. Any required offsite trial sections will be
 constructed at no additional cost to the State.

 405.02.6.4--Acceptance Procedure for Density. Each completed lift will be accepted
 with respect to compaction on a lot to lot basis from density tests performed by the
 Department. Material produced and placed during the trial section(s), if placed on the
 roadway, will be designated as separate lots. For normal production days, divide the
 production into approximately equal lots as shown in the following table. When cores
 are being used for the compaction evaluation, randomly obtain one core from each lot.
 When the nuclear density gauge is being used for compaction evaluation, obtain two
 random readings from each lot and average the results (see Chapter 7 of the latest edition
 of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA). Additional tests may be required by the Engineer
 to determine acceptance of work appearing deficient. The Contractor shall furnish and
 maintain traffic control for all compaction evaluations, including coring, required in
 satisfying specified density requirements.

 405.02.6.4.1--Roadway Density. The density requirement for each completed lift on a
 lot to lot basis from density tests performed by the Department shall be 93.0 percent of
 maximum density. When it is determined that the density for a lot is below 93.0 percent
 but not lower than 91.0 percent of maximum density, the Contractor will have the right to
 remove and replace the lot(s) not meeting the specified density requirements in lieu of
 accepting reduced payment for the lot(s).
 When it is determined that the density for a lot is above 96.0 percent, the Engineer shall
 notify the Contractor who will make plant adjustments to resolve the problem.
 When it is determined that the density for a lot is below 91.0 percent, the lot(s), or
 portions thereof, shall be removed and replaced in accordance with Chapter 7 of the latest
 edition of MDOT’s Field Manual for HMA at no additional cost to the State. A corrected
 lot will be retested for approval. No resampling will be performed when pavement
 samples are used for determining density.
 At any time the average daily compaction (the total of the percent compaction for the lots
 produced in one day divided by the total number of lots for the day) does not meet 93.0
 percent compaction or more for two consecutive days, the Contractor shall notify the
 Engineer of proposed changes to the compactive effort. If the average daily compaction
 does not meet 93.0 percent compaction or more for a third consecutive day, the
 Contractor shall stop production and construct another trial section to establish proper
 compaction procedures.

 The compaction pay factors and mixture quality pay factor will each apply separately
 (See Subsection 401.02.6.3). However, the combined pay factor shall not be less than
 0.50 for any mixture allowed to remain in place.
 405.03--Construction Requirements. Mississippi DOT has adopted the “Hot-Mix
 Asphalt Paving Handbook” as the guideline for acceptable SMA construction practices.
 405.03.1--Specific Requirements.
 405.03.1.1--Weather Limitations. The mixture shall not be placed when weather
 conditions prevent the proper handling and finishing or the surface on which it is to be
 placed is wet or frozen. At the time of placement, the air and pavement surface
 temperature limitations shall be equal to or exceed 55°F.
 405.03.1.2--Tack Coat. Tack coat shall be in accordance with Subsection 401.03.1.2.
 405.03.1.3--Blank.
 405.03.1.4--Density. The lot density for all SMA pavement lifts, except as provided
 below for preleveling, wedging [less than fifty percent (50%) of width greater than
 minimum lift thickness], ramp pads, irregular shoulder areas, median crossovers,
 turnouts, or other areas where the established rolling pattern cannot be performed, shall
 not be less than 93.0 percent of the maximum density based on AASHTO T 209 for the
 day’s production. If a job-mix formula adjustment is made during the day which affects
 the maximum specific gravity, calculate a new average maximum density for the lot(s)
 placed after the change.
 Pavement core samples obtained for determining density which have a thickness less than
 two times the maximum size aggregate permitted by the job-mix formula will not be used
 as a representative sample.
 Preleveling, wedging [less than fifty percent (50%) of width greater than minimum lift
 thickness], ramp pads, irregular shoulder areas, median crossovers, turnouts, and other
 areas where an established rolling pattern cannot be obtained shall be compacted to

 405.03.2--Bituminous Mixing Plants.
 405.03.2.1--Plant Requirements.
 405.03.2.1.1--Cold Aggregate Storage. The cold aggregate storage requirements shall
 be in accordance with Subsection 401.03.2.1.1.
 405.03.2.1.2--Cold Aggregate Feed. The cold aggregate feed requirements shall be in
 accordance with Subsection 401.03.2.1.2.
 405.03.2.1.3--Dryer. The dryer requirements shall be in accordance with Subsection
 401.03.2.1.3.
 405.03.2.1.4--Stabilizing Fiber Addition. For batch plants, fibers shall be added
 (manually or automatic) to either the pugmill or the weigh hopper. At least one aggregate
 source shall be added prior to the fiber addition, if fibers are added to the weigh hopper.
 Otherwise, fibers shall be added to the pugmill immediately after the addition of all the
 aggregate and prior to the addition of the asphalt binder.
 405.03.2.1.4.1--Manual Method. Provided it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer that the proper dosage rate of the stabilizing fibers is uniformly distributed into
 the mix, manual introduction of the fibers is acceptable when a batch plant is used to
 make the mix. When the fibers are available in prepackaged (weighed) containers,
 proper dosage may be pre-determined per batch. A device is required to interrupt
 mixture production and warn the plant operator if the operator manually feeding the fiber
 fails to introduce it properly.
 Manual introduction of fibers shall not be used in drum plants.
 405.03.2.1.4.2--Automatic Method. The automatic method requires specialized
 equipment that can accurately proportion and meter, by weight, the proper amount per
 batch for batch plants, or continuously and in a steady uniform manner for drum plants.
 Fiber, pelletized or loose, shall not be fed through the cold feed bins or through the RAP
 bins.
 These proportioning devices shall be interlocked with the plant system and controlled to
 +/-10 percent of the weight of the fibers required so as to maintain the correct proportions
 for all production rates and batch sizes. During trial section construction, an equipment
 calibration check shall be performed to the satisfaction of the Engineer that shows the
 fiber is being accurately metered and uniformly distributed into the mix. These metering
 devices shall provide in-process high flow (>10 percent or more) and low flow (<10
 percent or less) plant operator notification and interrupt the mix production where the
 fiber rate is not properly controlled. The fiber metering system shall also provide a
 record of feed rate (weight or mass per time) and include a section a minimum of two feet
 long of translucent pipe for visual confirmation of consistent flow rates. Care shall be
 taken to ensure that the fibers are not entrained in the plant’s exhaust system. If there is
 any evidence of fiber in the bag-house or wet-washer fines, the liquid asphalt binder line
 and/or the fiber line shall be relocated so that the fiber is captured by liquid asphalt binder
 spray and incorporated into the mix. If there is any evidence of clumps of fibers or
 pellets at the discharge chute, the contractor shall increase the mixing time and/or
 
 303
 
 Section 405

 intensity. This may entail extending the liquid asphalt binder and fiber feeding lines
 further into the drum.
 Note: Various stabilizing fiber suppliers have developed methodology and equipment for
 metering bulk loose and pelletized fiber into asphalt plants. Whenever the fiber
 supplier’s recommendations are more stringent than this specification, the fiber supplier’s
 recommendations shall control.
 405.03.2.2--Additional Requirements for Batching Plants. Additional requirements
 for batching plants shall be in accordance with Subsection 401.03.2.2.

 smooth and uniform forward and reverse speed as required for proper compaction.
 Pneumatic-tired rollers shall not be permitted for compacting SMA mixes. Rollers shall
 be equipped with adjustable scrapers, water tanks, mats and a device for wetting the
 wheels to prevent the mixture from sticking. Adhesion of the mixture to the rollers will
 not be permitted. The use of diesel fuel or gasoline for cleaning roller wheels, or to aid in
 preventing the mixture from sticking to the wheels, is prohibited.
 405.03.6--Preparation of Grade.

 Section 406
 
 accurate grade and cross slope. The equipment shall accurately and automatically
 establishing profile grades along each edge of the machine by referencing from the
 existing pavement with means of an approved profile averaging device with extreme
 contact points with surface at least 30 feet apart, or from an independent grade line and
 shall have an automatic system for controlling cross slope. The machine shall be
 equipped with an integral loading and reclaiming means to immediately remove material
 being cut from the surface and discharge the cuttings into a truck or windrow, all in one
 operation.
 When fine milling is required, the milling machine shall, in addition to the above, be
 designed specifically for grinding surfaces to close tolerances and shall be operated at a
 rate recommended by the manufacturer so as to avoid tearing and gouging of the
 pavement surface. The fine milling machine shall be equipped with a fine milling drum
 of the size and shape necessary to produce an ultrafine texture to the milled surface and
 meet the requirements of this specification. The bit or teeth spacing on the drum shall
 have a maximum spacing of six millimeters (6 mm). The equipment shall have a positive
 means for limiting any dust resulting from the operation from escaping into the air.
 Adequate back-up equipment, such as mechanical sweepers, loaders, water truck, etc.,
 and personnel shall be provided to ensure that all cuttings are removed immediately
 behind the milling machine.
 406.03.2--Construction Methods. When asphalt will be required on the milled area,
 milling operations shall not begin until the Contractor has an approved job-mix formula
 and is prepared to begin paving operations.
 The pavement and shoulder materials shall be removed to the depth, width, grade, and
 cross section shown on the plans, or as directed by the Engineer. The number of passes
 necessary to accomplish the work required herein and on the plans shall be determined by
 the Contractor.
 The surface of the pavement and shoulders, after milling, shall be reasonably smooth and
 true to the established line, grade and cross section. Areas damaged by the Contractor's
 operations shall be corrected and/or repaired as directed by the Engineer at no additional
 costs to the State. The Contractor shall take necessary action to prevent or minimize the
 ponding of water on the milled roadway and shoulder.
 Where traffic is required to be maintained adjacent to the milled area, no more than a 2¼inch differential in grade between the milled area and the adjacent surface will be
 allowed, unless a positive separation in accordance with the plans and specifications is
 established between the traffic and milled area.
 A longitudinal pavement edge that traffic is expected to move across should have an
 elevation difference of not more than 2¼ inches. Uneven pavement signs, as shown in
 the plans or contract documents, will be required if the pavement edge is more than1½
 inches and less than or equal to 2¼ inches. If the pavement edge is less than or equal to
 1½ inches, no uneven pavement signs will be required. Transverse pavement joints shall
 be sufficiently tapered to allow for the safe movement of traffic.

 406.03.3--Fine Milling. Unless otherwise noted or advised by the Engineer, the fine
 milling operation shall be conducted using an automatic grade control device, as
 referenced in Subsection 406.03.1, to establish accurate grade control and cross slope.
 The milled surface shall be textured, substantially free from waves or irregularities.
 Prior to beginning a fine milling operation, the Engineer may require the Contractor to
 construct a 500-foot test section. The texture and consistency of profile and cross slope
 of this test section will be evaluated by the Engineer to verify the above straight-edge
 requirement can be met.
 If the tolerance is exceeded in the test section, the Contractor shall cease work and take
 corrective actions to improve the process. Once corrective actions are taken, the
 Contractor will construct another test section. This designated section shall be fine
 milled to conform to the same requirements as those required in the initial test section.
 The Contractor shall not be allowed to start continuous fine milling until an acceptable
 test section is obtained.
 Fine milling shall produce a uniform finished surface and maintain a constant cross slope
 between extremities in each lane.
 The surface tolerance of the fine milling shall be checked to assure a uniform pavement
 texture that is true to line, grade, and cross section.
 Fine milled pavement surfaces are subject to visual and straightedge inspections by the
 Engineer at any time during the milling operation. The final fine milled surface shall be a
 uniform finish on the grade and slope shown to be required on the plans. The finished
 surface shall also not vary more than ¼” from a 10-foot straightedge placed anywhere on
 the surface of the milled area.
 The cross slope shall be checked to assure uniformity and that no depressions or slope
 misalignments exist when the slope is tested with a straightedge placed perpendicular to
 the center line.
 Dust, residue, and loose milled material shall be removed from the fine milled surface.
 Traffic shall not be allowed on the milled surface nor any tack coat applied and asphalt
 lift placed on the milled surface until removal is complete.

 SECTION 409 - GEOTEXTILE FABRIC FOR UNDERSEAL
 409.01--Description. This work consists of furnishing and placing fabric underseal in
 accordance with the details shown on the plans and the requirements of these
 specifications. An underseal shall consist of an application of asphalt cement covered
 with a layer of fabric.
 409.02--Materials.
 409.02.1--Geotextile Fabric. The fabric shall meet the specific requirements for
 geotextile fabric underseal contained in Subsection 714.13.4 and the applicable
 requirements of Subsection 714.13.
 409.02.2--Bituminous Material. Unless otherwise designated, the asphalt sealant shall
 be asphalt cement Grade PG 67-22 meeting the applicable requirements of Section 702.
 409.03--Construction Requirements.
 409.03.1--Equipment. The Contractor shall provide equipment for heating and applying
 bituminous material and for laying the pavement fabric.
 Heating equipment and distributors shall meet the requirements of Subsection 410.03.3.
 The mechanical fabric laydown equipment shall be capable of handling full rolls of fabric
 and shall be capable of laying the fabric smoothly without excessive wrinkles and/or
 folds. When manual laydown is required, a length of standard one inch pipe and suitable
 roll tension devices shall be used for proper roll handling.
 The fabric manufacturer or distributor shall furnish a technician to supervise installation
 of the fabric and training of Contractor's personnel.
 409.03.2--Surface Preparation. The surface to be treated, and at least one additional
 foot on each side, shall be cleaned by sweeping, blowing, or other methods until all dust,
 dirt, mud, vegetation, and foreign materials are removed entirely from the pavement
 before the asphalt sealant is applied. Care shall be exercised to prevent material so
 removed from becoming mixed with subsequent courses.
 409.03.3--Application of the Asphalt Sealant. The application of the asphalt sealant
 shall conform to the applicable requirements of Section 410. The sealant shall be
 uniformly sprayed over the area to be covered by fabric at a rate recommended by the
 fabric manufacturer or distributor's technician and/or ordered by the Engineer. The rate
 of application is usually between 0.20 and 0.40 gallon per square yard. Varying surface
 conditions such as the degree of porosity of the existing pavement will cause varying
 application rates. The quantity applied shall be sufficient to bond and saturate the fabric,
 and to bond the subsequent overlay course to the fabric. Within intersections or other
 zones where vehicle braking is frequent, the application rate should be reduced. The
 sealant shall be applied to an area two to six inches wider than the width of fabric being
 placed, but restricted to the area of immediate fabric laydown. Application shall be by
 distributor spray bar with hand hose spraying allowed only where the distributor spray
 bar cannot be used. Asphalt leakage from the distributor and any spillage shall be
 cleaned from the road surface to avoid flushing and possible fabric movement at these
 
 311
 
 Section 409
 
 Section 409
 
 asphalt rich areas. The asphalt cement used as a sealant shall have distributor tank
 temperature between 300°F and 350°F, except when applying a tack coat to the fabric,
 the temperature shall not exceed 320°F to avoid damaging the fabric.
 409.03.4--Fabric Placement. The fabric shall be placed on the asphaltic sealant as soon
 as practical and before the adhesion properties of the sealant is lost. The fabric shall be
 placed as smoothly as possible to avoid wrinkles.
 Wrinkles severe enough to cause "folds" shall be slit and laid flat. Small wrinkles which
 flatten under compaction are not detrimental to performance. The fabric shall be
 broomed or squeegeed to remove air bubbles and make complete contact with the road
 surface as recommended by the fabric manufacturer or distributor. The fabric shall be
 laid straight, however moderate curves can be negotiated by stretching the fabric on the
 outside of the curve.
 Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be made by overlapping the fabric at least six
 inches. Additional sealant shall be applied to the joints as required and may be applied
 by hand hose spraying or with mop and bucket if extreme care is taken to not over apply.
 Transverse joints should be "shingled" in the direction of construction traffic and paving
 to prevent pick-up. In circumstances where this method is impractical, asphalt pavement
 or sand spread over the joint will aid in prevention of pick-up.
 When recommended by the manufacturer or distributor's technician and/or ordered by the
 Engineer, the fabric shall be rolled with a pneumatic roller to improve bonding and
 reduce slippage.
 409.03.5--Treatment of Fabric Prior to Overlay. Normally it is not necessary to tack
 coat the fabric unless there are circumstances such as delay in placement of subsequent
 course, dust accumulation or insufficient initial application of sealant which would make
 tack coating desirable. If a tack coat is required by the Engineer, emulsified asphalt shall
 be applied at a rate of 0.02 to 0.05 gallon of residual asphalt per square yard.
 Placement of the subsequent course shall closely follow fabric laydown. In the event that
 the sealant bleeds through the fabric, it may be necessary to blot the sealant with sand to
 prevent construction equipment from picking up the fabric. Turning of the paver and
 other vehicles must be gradual to avoid strippage or damage to the fabric.
 If traffic must be maintained on the fabric prior to placement of the subsequent course, it
 is advisable to spread a small quantity of sand over the fabric and roll with a pneumatic
 roller to prevent tires from picking up the fabric.
 If rain should cause a blistered appearance and bond loss, it shall be corrected by rolling
 with a pneumatic roller.
 409.03.6--Asphalt Pavement Overlay. The overlay shall conform to Sections 401 and
 403 except that the mixture shall be delivered to the paver at a temperature of 275°F to
 300°F. Temperature of the mix shall in no case exceed 325°F.
 409.04--Method of Measurement. Geotextile fabric for underseal, placed in accordance
 with these specifications and as directed by the Engineer, will be measured by the square
 yard of surface area. Any overwidth of material installed and additional material required
 
 312
 
 Section 409
 
 Section 409
 
 for laps will not be measured.
 Asphalt cement for fabric underseal, applied in accordance with these specifications and
 as directed by the Engineer, will be measured by the gallon in accordance with
 Subsections 109.01 and 410.04.
 Any blotting with sand, rolling to restore bond and application of a tack coat will not be
 measured for payment and is considered incidental to completion of the work.
 409.05--Basis of Payment. Geotextile fabric for underseal will be paid for at the
 contract unit price per square yard. Asphalt cement for fabric underseal of the kind and
 grade specified, measured as provided above, will be paid for at the contract unit price
 per gallon. These prices shall be full compensation for satisfactorily completing the
 work.
 Payment will be made under:

 410.01--Description. This work consists of the construction of a single layer bituminous
 surface treatment (chip seal) in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably
 close conformity with the lines shown on the plans or established by the Engineer.
 410.02--Materials.
 410.02.1--Bituminous Material. The type and grade of bituminous materials will be
 specified in the contract and shall conform to the applicable requirements of Section 702.
 410.02.2--Cover Material. Cover material shall meet the applicable requirements of
 Subsection 703.14, and the kind and type will be specified in the contract.
 Only one type of aggregate or combination of aggregates shall be used on a particular
 project except with written permission of the Engineer.
 Sites for stockpiles of materials shall be grubbed and cleaned prior to storing the
 aggregates, and the ground shall be firm, smooth, and well drained.
 410.03--Construction Requirements.
 410.03.1--General. Prime coats, when specified, shall meet the requirements of Section
 408. After the application of a prime coat, the primed surface shall be kept in continuous
 repair. All holes, raveled areas, and areas deficient in prime shall be patched and repaired
 with approved materials.
 
 313
 
 Section 410
 
 Section 410
 
 Prior to any chip sealing operation, “Loose Rock” signs shall be installed and remain in
 place until all sealing operations are complete. Prior to any daily sealing operation,
 portable “Loose Rock” signs shall be installed in accordance with the drawing in the
 plans or contract documents. Portable signs shall be installed and remain in place on a
 daily basis in the active sealing area. Payment for signs shall be made under pay item no.
 618-A, Maintenance of Traffic.
 410.03.2--Seasonal and Weather Limitations. Emulsified asphalt and cut-back asphalt
 shall be applied only when both the air and pavement temperatures are above 70°F.
 Asphalt cement shall be applied only when both the air and surface temperatures are
 above 75°F.
 Cut-back asphalt shall not be placed during the period between October 15 and March 1.
 No prime shall be placed when soil and weather conditions would prevent the proper
 placement and retention of the materials.
 Bituminous materials for surface treatment shall not be placed during the period between
 November 1 and March 1, nor when weather conditions otherwise prevent the proper
 placement and retention of the materials.
 On projects where completion of seal coats after November 1 or before March 1 is
 determined to be in the public interest, the Engineer may permit variations from the
 above under the condition that all the following requirements are met:
 (a) The air and pavement temperature is 70°F or higher.
 (b) Asphalt cement used is cut back with naphtha of the type that will yield from 510 percent off at 680°F when tested by method AASHTO T 78 and the naphtha
 is added at the refinery.
 (c) As an alternate to (b), the Contractor substitutes a rapid setting cationic
 emulsified asphalt meeting the requirements of AASHTO M 208.
 (d) Aggregate is satisfactorily air dried in covered storage, or mechanically dried.
 (e) The sun is shining.
 (f) Aggregate is applied immediately behind the distributor.
 (g) No shot is made after mid-afternoon, and rolling is increased as directed for
 shots made after noon.
 (h) The Contractor retains full responsibility for the acceptable quality of the work
 within the intent of the contract, these conditions notwithstanding.
 (i) The work is performed under these modifications at no additional cost to the
 State.
 Blanket authorization will not be given for use of the above modification, but will be
 given only when completion of the surface treatment would make the facility available
 for use by public traffic, or for subsequent construction.
 Prior to November 1 and after March 1, when the requirements of these specifications are
 being met, but conditions are less than good for the adhesion of cover aggregate to the
 bituminous material, the Engineer may permit or require, at no additional cost to the State
 that the asphalt cement be cut back with naphtha as previously indicated. Less than good
 placement conditions shall be understood to include, but not limited to: lower than
 desirable temperature; higher than desirable humidity; surface dampness; or coolness of
 the foundation or aggregate.

 Section 410
 
 410.03.3--Equipment. The following or equivalent equipment shall be furnished.
 410.03.3.1--Bituminous Heating Equipment. This equipment shall heat and maintain
 the bituminous material within specification requirements without damaging the material.
 The heating equipment shall be supplied with at least one accurate asphalt thermometer.
 410.03.3.2--Distributor. The distributor shall be mounted on pneumatic tires of
 sufficient width to prevent breaking the surface bond when the tank is fully loaded. It
 shall be self-propelled and sufficiently powered to maintain the desired speeds during
 operation. It shall be equipped to evenly heat and maintain the material at the required
 temperature; have adequate pressure devices and suitable manifolds to provide constant
 and even distribution for the entire length of the spray bars; and have positive cutoff to
 prevent dripping from the nozzles. It shall be so constructed that uniform applications
 may be made at the specified rate on variable widths up to 26 feet. Charts and devices
 shall be provided by the Contractor for determining the quantity being applied.
 410.03.3.3--Rotary Brooms. Rotary brooms shall be constructed to permit the
 revolutions of the broom to be adjusted to its progression and to permit adjustment of the
 broom in relation to the surface. The broom bristles shall be stiff enough to sweep clean
 without injury to the surface.
 410.03.3.4--Power Rollers. Steel-wheel rollers will not be allowed.
 Pneumatic rollers shall be self-propelled with wheels mounted on two axles in such a
 manner that the rear tires will not follow in the tracks of the forward group. The rollers
 shall be capable of applying a minimum of 50 pounds per square inch contact pressure
 under each tire, and shall be of a weight that will not damage the base or surface
 treatment.
 410.03.3.5--Trucks. Trucks of sufficient number and size to adequately supply the
 material shall be furnished.
 410.03.3.6--Aggregate Spreaders. Aggregate spreaders shall be constructed so that they
 can be accurately gauged and set to uniformly distribute the required quantity of
 aggregate at regulated speed.
 410.03.3.7--Other Equipment. Drag brooms shall be furnished and used as conditions
 dictate.
 410.03.4--Preparation of Surface. The entire surface to be treated and at least one foot
 on each side shall be cleaned by sweeping, blowing, or other methods until all dust, mud,
 clay lumps, and foreign material is removed. A primed base shall be properly cured and
 approved prior to application of bituminous material.
 410.03.5--Application of Bituminous Material. Bituminous material shall not be
 applied until the prepared surface has been approved by the Engineer. Where practicable,
 shots shall be at least 500 feet in length, and longer shots are desirable. No shot shall be
 in excess of a length which can be covered with aggregate before the bitumen hardens.
 The bituminous material shall be uniformly heated and maintained within the specified
 
 315
 
 Section 410
 
 Section 410
 
 temperature range during application. All material damaged by heating shall be rejected,
 and if a section has been treated with damaged material it shall be removed and replaced
 by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 Emulsified asphalt material shall be applied with a pressure distributor at the specified
 rate, and at a temperature of 140° to 180°F. All other bituminous material shall be
 applied with a pressure distributor at the temperature range set out in Subsection 702.11.
 It shall be uniformly applied full width in one operation unless the Engineer permits it to
 be applied in narrower widths.
 The application rate of the bituminous material shall result in complete and uniform
 coverage of the pavement receiving the bituminous surface treatment. If the application
 of the bituminous material does not result in complete coverage, the Contractor shall
 cease operations and adjust the distributor bar height and/or nozzle(s) such that complete
 coverage is attained. At a minimum, the application rate of the Bituminous Material
 should be verified daily by the Department.
 The optimum application rate of bituminous material for chip seals is dependent on the
 chosen seal aggregate gradation as well as the condition of the pavement in which the
 chip seal is to be applied. The application rate of the bituminous material may be
 adjusted by the Engineer based on field conditions at the time of construction. The
 following are target application rates for bituminous material.

 Note: Emulsified Asphalt shall not be diluted. A sample of emulsified asphalt should be
 obtained from the Contractor’s distributor on the first day of production and
 thereafter at a frequency not to exceed 1 sample per 50,000 gallons. Because the
 time between sampling of the emulsified asphalt and the testing of the material can
 affect the test results, samples should be sent to the MDOT Central Lab for testing
 as soon as possible.
 The application shall be stopped before the distributor is completely empty, and the
 length of shots shall be computed so that the application is stopped before it begins to run
 light. At the beginning of the application, including joints with preceding applications,
 intersections, and junctions with all pavements, etc., the distributor nozzles shall be
 operating at full force when the application begins. Building paper or other suitable
 material shall be used to receive the initial application from the nozzles before the asphalt
 reaches the road surface at the joint. The material shall be removed immediately after use
 without spilling asphalt on the road surface.
 Spray bar nozzles shall be kept clean at all times, and should one become blocked during
 application of the bituminous material, the distributor shall be stopped immediately and
 the nozzle cleaned before proceeding. Bare or light areas shall be immediately made
 uniform by use of a hand hose or pouring pot.
 
 316
 
 Section 410
 
 Section 410
 
 Due to possible spillage, the transfer of material from the delivery truck to the distributor
 shall be outside the limits of the roadway. Bituminous material shall not be discharged
 on the right-of-way when cleaning out the distributor. Any spillage shall be removed
 from the roadway and right-of-way.
 During application of bituminous material, the Contractor shall provide adequate
 protection to prevent marring or discoloration of pavements, structures, curbs, trees, etc.,
 adjacent to the area being treated.
 Longitudinal joints, when permitted, shall be reasonably true to line and parallel to the
 centerline. The overlap in the application of the bituminous material shall be the
 minimum to assure complete coverage.
 At construction joints, the treatment of the edges shall be blended so that there are no
 gaps, the elevations are the same, and the joints are free from ridges and depressions.
 410.03.6--Application of Cover Coat Material. The application of cover material shall
 immediately follow the application of bituminous material. Adhesion of the cover
 aggregate to the bitumen is the Contractor's responsibility. The time interval between
 applications of bituminous material and cover aggregate shall not exceed 20 minutes
 when the air temperature is below 85°F or 30 minutes when the temperature is 85°F or
 above.
 Aggregate shall be spread directly from approved spreaders. Trucks or spreaders shall
 not drive on the uncovered bituminous material.
 The application rate of cover aggregate shall be within the following range.
 Size 7 Slag, Stone, Gravel or Expanded Clay ................ 0.30 ±0.02 ft3 / yd2
 Size 8 Expanded Clay ..................................................... 0.25 ±0.02 ft3 / yd2
 Size 89 Slag, Stone, or Gravel ........................................ 0.25 ±0.02 ft3 / yd2
 During the first day of production and at least once a week thereafter, the application rate
 of the seal aggregate shall be verified by the Department to assure that the appropriate
 application rate of the seal aggregate is applied. The rate can be verified by placing a tarp
 of at least 1.0 yd2 area on the roadway surface. After allowing the seal aggregate
 spreader to pass over the tarp, the aggregate on the tarp should be collected and weighed
 to determine the weight of aggregate. The measured weight should then be compared to
 the target weight calculated using the following formula.
 W = 0.85(Gsb)(Uw)(R)(A)(e)

 Bulk specific gravities of expanded clay and steel slag should be obtained from
 the seal aggregate supplier.
 
 Upon determining the target weight, it should be compared to the actual measured
 weight. If the difference in the target weight and the actual measured weight is over 2.5
 pounds, the seal aggregate distributor should be adjusted such that the spread rate is
 within the above tolerance. The above procedure shall be repeated until the spread rate is
 within the allowable tolerance.
 If at any point during production, excessive seal aggregate is noted, the seal aggregate
 application rate should be verified and the spread rate adjusted. The intent is to minimize
 the amount of excess seal aggregate. Excess seal aggregate removed from the roadway
 surface after brooming shall be removed from the job site and should not be reused in the
 seal aggregate operation.
 The dry aggregate shall be spread uniformly to cover the bituminous material with the
 quantity of aggregate specified by the Engineer. All deficient areas shall be covered by
 additional material.
 If needed, approved drag brooms and hand brooms shall be used to distribute the
 aggregate uniformly before and while the rolling operations are in progress.
 The entire application of aggregate shall be rolled as soon as possible after application.
 Rolling shall be continued and repeated as often as necessary to key the cover material
 thoroughly into the bituminous material over the entire surface.
 Pneumatic rollers and steel-wheel rollers shall be used in the sequence that will provide
 the rolling pattern that results in the best adhesion of the aggregate to the bituminous
 material and the best surface qualities.
 Subsequent to the initial application of the aggregate the Contractor shall distribute, as
 many times as is deemed necessary, loose aggregate over the surface to absorb free
 bituminous material and to cover areas deficient in aggregate. Immediately following
 each distribution, the Contractor shall roll the entire surface treatment or seal with a
 pneumatic-tire roller until the maximum quantity of aggregate is embedded in the
 bitumen. Rolling in each case shall be at least one complete coverage and as many
 additional coverages as necessary to properly embed the aggregate. All rolling shall be
 performed while the temperature is favorable for sealing the aggregate into the bitumen.
 In all cases there shall be at least five complete coverages of the entire surface of the
 treatment with a pneumatic-tire roller.
 410.03.7--Control of Traffic. Unless otherwise advised, the Contractor’s operations
 shall be schedule such that all lanes of traffic are open to the traveling public at the end of
 each day. Considering time needed for curing and preparation prior to opening traffic,
 the Contractor should not apply bituminous material two (2) hours before dusk, or longer,
 to allow sufficient time for bonding of the aggregates.
 
 318
 
 Section 410
 
 Section 410
 
 After the surface treatment has been rolled and the bituminous material has cured a
 minimum of one (1) hour, or longer if necessary to sufficiently hold the aggregate in
 place, the Contractor shall perform an initial brooming operation consisting of lightly
 sweeping excess aggregate material from the surface. After the initial brooming has been
 completed, public traffic will be allowed on the roadway.
 Immediately the next morning, a final brooming shall be performed to remove any
 remaining excess aggregate material from the previous day’s seal operation.
 410.04--Method of Measurement. Accepted asphalt for surface treatment will be
 measured by the gallon as prescribed in Subsection 109.01. Unless otherwise specified,
 distributor tank measurement will be used. The volume of material over five percent
 above the quantity ordered for each shot will be deducted from measured quantities,
 except that 15 percent will be allowed for irregular areas where hand spraying is
 necessary.
 Aggregate cover material will be measured by the cubic yard (LVM) at the point of
 delivery on the road. Measurement will be for the actual volume spread. The volume of
 material over five percent above the quantity ordered for each "spreading" will be
 deducted from measured quantities, except that 15 percent will be allowed for irregular
 areas where hand "spreading" is necessary.
 The volume of all cover material and the volume of all bituminous material lost, wasted,
 damaged, or rejected, or applied outside of designated areas, or in excess of the
 Engineer's directions and tolerances allowed, or contrary to the specifications, will be
 deducted from measured quantities.
 410.05--Basis of Payment. Asphalt for surface treatment will be paid for at the contract
 unit price per gallon. Aggregate cover material will be paid for at the contract unit price
 per cubic yard (LVM). The prices thus paid shall be full compensation for completing
 the work.

 applied.
 Sealant material shall be at the pouring temperature recommended by the manufacturer
 when applied to the joints. Hot applied sealant material shall be stirred during heating so
 that localized overheating does not occur.
 The sealant shall fill the joint such that, after cooling, the sealed joint conforms to the
 details shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer. The pouring shall be
 performed in such a manner that the material will not be spilled on the exposed surfaces
 of the asphalt pavement. Any excess material on the surface of the asphalt pavement
 shall be removed immediately and the pavement surface cleaned. The use of sand or
 similar material as a cover for the seal will not be permitted. Poured joint sealing
 material shall not be placed when the air temperature in the shade is less than 50°F.,
 unless approved by the Engineer.
 413.03.4--Cleaning and Filling Joints. Any existing asphalt over the joint shall be
 removed by milling or other approved methods so as to expose the PCC joint for cleaning
 and filling. All existing joint materials (soil, asphalt, debris) and any loose, spalled or
 delaminated materials shall be removed to the depth specified herein, without causing
 damage to the existing joint faces or the surface of the PCC pavement. Joints shall be
 filled immediately upon cleaning. The joint shall be filled to the specified depth with the
 required filler(s) as shown in the applicable detail. When asphalt or aggregate is placed
 as joint filler, the asphalt or aggregate shall be slightly mounded in the joint and
 compacted as directed by the Engineer to seat the asphalt or aggregate in the joint. After
 compaction, excess material (asphalt or aggregate) shall be removed and the pavement
 surface cleaned as necessary, so as to leave the asphalt or aggregate filler flush with the
 existing PCC pavement. Any existing asphalt over the joint which requires removal shall
 be replaced with either 9.5-mm or 12.5-mm asphalt or the same mixture as that specified
 for the wearing course to be placed under the contract, if required. The asphalt shall be
 properly compacted with a roller or other mechanical compaction device approved by the
 Engineer, either prior to opening to traffic, or prior to placement of the subsequent overall
 asphalt course. Placement of any required subsequent overall asphalt course shall begin
 upon completion of the cleaning and filling operation. For PCC pavements without
 existing asphalt overlays in place and which are not to be overlayed with asphalt under
 the contract, joints shall be cleaned and filled as described above and as shown on the
 applicable detail.

 SECTION 423 - GROUND-IN RUMBLE STRIPS
 423.01--Description. This work consists of grinding rumble strips at the locations
 indicated on the plan, in accordance with the details on the plans, and the requirements
 set out herein.
 423.02--Blank.
 423.03--Construction Requirements.
 423.03.1--Equipment. The equipment shall consist of a rotary type cutting head capable
 of cutting rumble strips to the dimensions shown on the plans. The cutting head shall
 have the cutting tips arranged in such pattern as to provide a relatively smooth cut of
 approximately 1/8 of an inch between peaks and valleys. The cutting head(s) shall be on
 its own independent suspension from that of the power unit to allow the tool to self-align
 with the slope of the shoulder and/or any irregularities in the shoulder surface.
 The finished rumble strips shall be cut to the dimensions as shown on the plans within the
 allowable tolerance and be perpendicular to the direction of travel. The rumble strips
 shall be placed in relation to the roadway according to the patterns shown on the plans.
 Adequate back-up equipment such as mechanical sweeper/vacuum, water truck, etc. and
 personnel shall be provided to remove all grindings from the shoulder.
 423.03.2--Construction Details. The cutting tool shall be equipped with guides to
 provide a consistent alignment of each cut in relation to the edge line and to provide
 uniformity and consistency throughout the project. The alignment of the cuts shall not
 deviate from the path of the edge line.
 When the contract requires shoulder paving, the rumble strips shall be cut into the
 finished shoulder after the final course has been placed, otherwise, rumble strips shall be
 cut into the existing shoulder material. The debris/grindings generated from the cutting
 shall be picked up and removed on a daily basis by use of a sweeper/vacuum or other
 method approved by the Engineer. The shoulder shall be cleaned prior to opening the
 adjacent lane to traffic. Any other method of cleaning debris from the shoulder or
 roadway other than picking up shall be approved by the Engineer prior to beginning
 
 336
 
 Section 423
 
 Section 423
 
 construction. The use of the material from the rumble strips as RAP in the composition
 of asphalt mixtures shall require approval by the State Materials Engineer.
 The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer the ability to achieve the desired
 surface inside each depression without tearing or snagging the asphalt prior to beginning
 the work. Areas damaged by the Contractor's operations shall be corrected and/or
 repaired as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the State.
 When placed on concrete shoulders, the Contractor shall adjust the spacing of the rumble
 strips to ensure that the depressions are not cut across a concrete shoulder joint.
 This construction operation will encroach on the lane adjacent to the shoulder receiving
 the rumble strips. Therefore, construction on roadways under traffic will either require a
 lane closure or be considered as a moving operation. Traffic control shall be handled in
 accordance with the appropriate standard drawings shown in the plans or contract
 documents.
 423.04--Method of Measurement. Rumble strips, ground-in, completed in accordance
 with the plans and specifications, will be measured by the mile, which price shall be full
 compensation for all materials, equipment, tools, disposal of grinding debris, any
 associated traffic control, and all incidentals necessary to complete the work. Length of
 measurement will start at the beginning of a continuous series of rumble strips and will
 terminate at the end of the continuous series. The length used to measure rumble strips
 will be the horizontal length computed along the stationed control line. Each shoulder on
 which rumble strips have been ground will be measured separately with the
 measurements from each shoulder combined to obtain the pay length for rumble strips.
 423.05--Basis of Payment. Rumble strips, measured as prescribed above, will be paid
 for at the contract unit price per mile, which price shall be full compensation for
 completing the work.
 The price for rumble strips shall include the cost of any required maintenance of traffic
 and protective services.

 to use the prepared grade, the grade shall be checked and corrected immediately ahead of
 
 341
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 the placing of the concrete.
 Unless the base course is waterproof, it shall be uniformly moist when the concrete is
 placed.
 501.03.10--Handling, Measuring and Batching Materials. The batch plant site, layout,
 equipment, and provisions for transporting material shall be sufficient to assure a
 continuous supply of material to the work. Stockpiles shall be built up in layers of not
 more than five feet in thickness. Each layer shall be completely in place before beginning
 the next, which shall not be allowed to "cone" down over the next lower layer. Aggregates
 from different sources and of different gradings shall not be stockpiled together.
 Aggregates shall be handled from stockpiles or other sources to the batching plant in a
 manner that will assure uniform grading of the material. Aggregates that have become
 segregated shall not be used until properly reblended. Aggregates contaminated with earth
 or foreign material shall not be used. All aggregates produced or handled by hydraulic
 methods and washed aggregates, shall be stockpiled or binned for draining at least 12 hours
 before being batched. Rail shipment requiring more than 12 hours will be accepted as
 adequate binning only if the car bodies permit free drainage. In case the aggregates contain
 a high or nonuniform moisture content, storage or stockpile periods in excess of 12 hours
 may be required by the Engineer.
 The fine aggregate and each size of coarse aggregate shall be separately weighed into
 hoppers in the quantities set by the job-mix. Cement shall be measured by weight. Separate
 scales and hoppers, with a device to indicate the complete discharge of the batch of cement
 into the batch box or container, shall be used for weighing the cement.
 Unless otherwise permitted by the contract, batching plants shall be equipped to proportion
 aggregates and bulk cement by weight using approved automatic and interlocked
 proportioning devices.
 For on-site mixing, aggregates shall be transported from the batching plant to the mixer in
 batch boxes, vehicle bodies, or other containers of adequate capacity and construction to
 properly carry the volume required. Partitions separating batches shall be adequate and
 effective to prevent spilling from one compartment to another while in transit or being
 dumped. When bulk cement is used, the Contractor shall use a suitable method of handling
 the cement from weighing hopper to transporting container so as to assure the correct
 cement content in each batch. Bulk cement shall be transported to the mixer in separate
 and tight compartments carrying the full amount of cement required for the batch. Cement
 in original shipping packages may be transported on top of the aggregates with each batch
 containing the required number of sacks. Batches shall be delivered to the mixer separately
 and intact. Each batch shall be dumped into the mixer without loss of cement and, when
 more than one batch is carried on a truck, without spilling of material from one batch
 compartment into another.
 Water may be measured either by volume or by weight. Unless the water is to be weighed,
 the water-measuring equipment shall include an auxiliary tank from which the measuring
 tank shall be filled. The measuring tank shall be equipped with an outside tap and valve to
 provide for checking the setting, unless other means are provided for readily and accurately
 determining the quantity of water in the tank. The volume of the auxiliary tank shall be at
 least equal to that of the measuring tank.

 Methods and equipment for adding air entraining agent or other admixtures into the batch
 shall be approved by the Engineer.
 The accuracy for measuring materials shall be in accordance with AASHTO M 157.
 501.03.11--Mixing Concrete. The mixer shall be of an approved type and capacity.
 Mixing time shall be measured from the time all materials, except water, are in the drum.
 Ready-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered in accordance with requirements of
 Section 804.
 When mixed at the site of the work or in a central mixing plant, the mixing time must
 provide a satisfactory mixture, and unless otherwise specified in writing by the State
 Materials Engineer, the mixing time shall be not less than 50 seconds. When deemed
 necessary to ensure a satisfactory mix, the State Materials Engineer may designate a mixing
 time suitable to obtain a satisfactory mixture. Four seconds will be added to the specified
 mixing time if timing starts the instant the skip reaches its maximum raised position.
 Mixing time ends when the discharge chute opens. Transfer time in multiple drum mixers
 is included in the mixing time. The contents of an individual mixer drum shall be emptied
 before a succeeding batch is placed therein.
 The mixer shall be operated at the drum speed shown on the manufacturer's name plate on
 the mixer. All concrete mixed less than the specified time shall be discarded and disposed
 of by the Contractor at no cost to the State. The volume of concrete mixed per batch shall
 not exceed the mixer's nominal capacity in cubic feet, as shown on the manufacturer's
 standard rating plate on the mixer, except that an overload of up to 10 percent may be
 permitted provided concrete test data for strength, segregation, and uniform consistency
 are satisfactory, and provided no spillage of concrete takes place.
 The batch shall be so charged into the drum that a portion of the mixing water enters in
 advance of the cement and aggregates. The flow of water shall be uniform and all water
 shall be in the drum by the end of the first 15 seconds of the mixing period. The throat of
 the drum shall be kept free of accumulations that might restrict the free flow of materials
 into the drum.
 Mixed concrete from a central-mixing plant shall be transported in truck mixers, truck
 agitators, or nonagitating trucks having approved bodies. The elapsed time from when
 water is added to the mix until the concrete is deposited at the site of the work shall not
 exceed 30 minutes, 45 minutes when a retarder is used, when the concrete is hauled in
 nonagitating trucks, nor 60 minutes when hauled in truck mixers or truck agitators.
 Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be permitted. However,
 when concrete is delivered in transit mixers or agitators and if permitted by the Engineer,
 additional water may be added to the batch materials and additional mixing performed to
 increase the slump to meet the specified requirements, provided all these operations are
 performed within 45 minutes after the initial mixing operation and the total amount of
 water in the concrete does not exceed the mix design amount. Concrete that exceeds the
 maximum slump at time of placement shall not be used. Admixtures for increasing the
 workability or for accelerating the set will be permitted only when specifically provided
 for in the contract, or when permitted in writing by the Engineer.

 501.03.12--Limitations of Mixing. Except in emergencies, no concrete shall be mixed or
 placed when the natural light will be insufficient for finishing. In case of an emergency,
 the Engineer may permit finishing during periods of insufficient light provided adequate
 and approved lighting is furnished by the Contractor.
 Concrete shall not be placed on a frozen foundation, nor shall frozen aggregate be used in
 the concrete.
 During periods of cold or expected cold weather, the limitations for beginning a concrete
 pour and the limitations for temperature control of the mix and its components shall be in
 accordance with the provisions of Subsection 804.03.16.1.
 During periods of hot weather or arid atmospheric conditions the provisions of Subsection
 804.03.16.2 shall be applicable.
 501.03.13--Placing Concrete.
 501.03.13.1--General. Concrete shall be mechanically spread in an approved manner so
 as to distribute the concrete uniformly without segregation. On roadside areas such as
 driveways and parking areas for weigh stations or roadside parks, etc. and on other small
 or irregular areas the concrete may be placed by other approved methods.
 The rate of delivery of the concrete shall be such that the interval between the discharge of
 the successive loads shall not exceed 20 minutes, and when air temperature is 90°F or
 higher the interval shall not exceed 15 minutes. Concrete that has begun to set up shall not
 be placed in the work.
 All concrete materials that may fall on or be worked into the surface of a completed slab
 shall be removed immediately by approved methods.
 501.03.13.2--Formed Pavement. The concrete shall be deposited on the grade in a manner
 that will require as little rehandling as possible.
 For paneled pavement, placing shall be continuous between transverse joints without the
 use of intermediate bulkheads. For continuously reinforced pavement, placing shall be
 continuous between construction joints without use of intermediate bulkheads. Necessary
 hand spreading shall be performed with shovels and not rakes. Workers shall not be
 allowed to walk in the freshly mixed concrete with boots or shoes coated with earth or
 foreign substances.
 When concrete is to be placed adjoining a previously constructed lane of pavement and
 mechanical equipment will be operated upon the existing lane of pavement, that lane shall
 have attained the age of 14 days, exclusive of days on which the air temperature does not
 reach 35°F, or shall have attained a flexural strength of 600 pounds per square inch. If only
 light finishing bridges or other similar light equipment is partially carried on the existing
 lane, paving in the adjoining lanes will be permitted after three days.
 Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated against and along the faces of all forms and
 along the full length and on both sides of all joint assemblies, by means of vibrators inserted
 in the concrete. Vibrators shall not come in contact with a joint assembly, reinforcing steel,
 the base, or a side form. In no case shall the vibrators be operated longer than 15 seconds
 
 344
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 in one location.
 Concrete shall be deposited as near to expansion and contraction joints as possible without
 disturbing them, but shall not be dumped onto a joint assembly unless the hopper is well
 centered on the joint assembly.
 The Contractor shall have available at all times materials for the protection of unhardened
 concrete in the event of rain.
 501.03.13.3--Slip-Form Pavement. The Contractor shall have sufficient forms available
 on the project for use in the event of an emergency.
 In order that the concrete may be properly protected against the effects of rain before it has
 sufficiently hardened, the Contractor shall have available at all times materials for the
 protection of the edges and surface of the unhardened concrete. Protective materials shall
 include standard metal forms, or wood planks having a nominal thickness of at least two
 inches and a nominal width of not less than the thickness of the pavement, and covering
 material such as burlap or cotton mats, curing paper, or plastic sheeting material. When
 rain appears imminent, all paving operations shall stop, and all available personnel shall
 begin placing forms against the sides of the pavement and covering the surface of the
 unhardened concrete with the protective covering.
 The concrete shall be of uniform consistency and placed, shaped, consolidated, and float
 finished by an approved slip-form paver. The slip-form paver shall be operated off of a
 taut stringline or wire set by the Contractor to true grade and alignment, except that if the
 grade at each form line, plus the width of the track of the paver, has been constructed within
 the tolerance allowed at the form line in Subsection 321.03.7 the automatic control devices
 on the paver will not be required.
 The equipment shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of
 pavement being placed. Vibration shall be accomplished with vibrating tubes or arms
 working in the concrete or with a vibrating screed or pan operating on the surface of the
 concrete. No appreciable slumping of the in-place concrete will be allowed, and, if
 necessary, forms shall be trailed behind the paver to prevent slumping. If trailing forms
 are used, they shall be rigidly supported laterally.
 The slipform paver shall be operated with as nearly a continuous forward movement as
 possible. If, for any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward movement of the paver, the
 vibratory and tamping elements shall be stopped immediately.
 Where sections of pavement are to be subsequently abutted with other lanes of pavement
 involving longitudinal or nearly longitudinal joints, the concrete adjacent to these joints
 shall be placed and finished as required by standard paving methods or by use of false
 forms, adjacent to the slip forms. The false forms shall be metal of sufficient gage to
 maintain the proper shape and continuity of the form line and shall be approved by the
 Engineer. The use of false forms shall be subject to satisfactory performance. If the
 Contractor is able to construct the pavement without measurable edge slump or
 misalignment, the Engineer may waive the use of the false form.
 When required, bracing of the forms shall be accomplished so there will not be more than
 10 feet of unbraced false forms. False forms shall remain in place of a minimum of 90
 
 345
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 minutes or until forms can be removed without damaging the adjacent concrete.
 501.03.14--Test Specimens. The Contractor shall furnish the concrete necessary for test
 specimens. The specimens shall be made and cured as specified in Subsection
 804.02.13.1.1 thru Subsection 804.02.13.1.5 at the frequency in TMD 20-04-00-000.
 Testing personnel shall meet the requirements in Subsection 804.02.9. Laboratory and test
 equipment shall meet the requirements in Subsection 804.02.8.
 501.03.15--Strike-Off of Concrete and Placement of Reinforcement.
 501.03.15.1--General. Reinforcing steel shall be free from dirt, oil, paint, grease, mill
 scale, and loose or thick rust which could impair bond of the steel with the concrete.
 501.03.15.2--Bar Mat Reinforcement. When the pavement is placed in two layers, the
 entire width of the bottom layer shall be struck off to the length and depth that will permit
 the sheet of bar mat to be laid full length on the concrete in its final position without further
 manipulation. The reinforcement shall then be placed directly upon the bottom layer, after
 which the top layer shall be placed, struck off, and screeded. All concrete in the bottom
 layer which has been placed more than 30 minutes without being covered with the top layer
 shall be removed and replaced with freshly mixed concrete at no additional costs to the
 State. When the pavement is placed in one layer, the reinforcement may be placed in the
 plastic concrete after spreading, by approved mechanical or vibratory means, or it may be
 positioned in advance of concrete placement on supports that will withstand, without
 displacement, all depositing, spreading, and vibrating operations.
 501.03.15.3--Continuous Reinforcement. Steel for continuously reinforced pavement
 shall be placed by the first of the following methods or conditionally by the second method:
 (a) Steel shall be placed sufficiently in advance of the paving operation. It shall be
 supported on approved chairs, positioned, and tied in accordance with the plans.
 (b) Machine placement of steel for slip-form paving will be permitted provided the
 Contractor satisfactorily demonstrates that the equipment used will position the
 steel in accordance with the plans with the exception that transverse bars will be
 permitted to be placed on top of longitudinal bars.
 501.03.16--Joints. Joints shall be constructed of the type and dimensions and at the
 locations required by the plans, or as directed.
 Sawing of joints shall commence as possible after the concrete has hardened and before
 uncontrolled shrinkage cracking occurs. The saw blades, and skid plates if early entry
 method is used, shall be changed as often as necessary to control and minimize
 spalling/raveling. A sufficient number of saws, replacement blades and skid plates shall
 be available at the project site to ensure that the sawing operations will proceed until
 completion without interruption.
 Any damage to the concrete resulting from the sawing operations shall be corrected
 immediately after the sawing is complete at no additional costs to the State.
 501.03.16.1--Longitudinal Joints. Deformed steel tie bars or transverse bars of specified
 length, size, spacing, and material shall be placed perpendicular to the longitudinal joints.
 They shall be placed by approved mechanical equipment or rigidly secured by chairs or
 
 346
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 other approved supports to prevent displacement. Tie bars shall not be painted or coated
 with asphalt or other material, or enclosed in tubes or sleeves.
 When adjacent lanes of pavement are constructed separately, longitudinal construction
 joints shall be constructed in accordance with the details shown on the plans. Tie bars,
 except those made of rail steel, may be bent at right angles against the form of the first lane
 constructed and straightened into final position before the concrete of the adjacent lane is
 placed.
 The longitudinal center joint shall be installed so that its ends are in contact with transverse
 joints, if any.
 Longitudinal joints shall be constructed by sawing or forming in accordance with the plans.
 501.03.16.2--Transverse Expansion Joints. The expansion joint filler shall be continuous
 from form to form and shaped to the subgrade and to the keyway along the form.
 Preformed joint filler shall be furnished in lengths equal to the pavement width or equal to
 the width of one lane. Damaged or repaired joint filler shall not be used unless approved
 by the Engineer.
 The expansion joint filler shall be held in a vertical position. An approved installing bar,
 or other device, shall be used if required to secure preformed expansion joint filler at the
 proper grade and alignment during placing and finishing of the concrete. Finished joints
 shall not deviate more than one-fourth inch in the horizontal alignment from a straight line.
 If joint fillers are assembled in section, there shall be no offsets between adjacent units.
 Plugs of concrete will not be permitted within the expansion space.
 501.03.16.3--Transverse Contraction Joints. Transverse contraction joints shall consist
 of planes of weakness created by forming or sawing grooves in the surface of the pavement
 as shown on the plans and shall include load transfer assemblies when specified.
 501.03.16.4--Transverse Construction Joints. Transverse construction joints shall be
 constructed when there is an interruption of more than 30 minutes in the concreting
 operation. Construction joints shall not be constructed within 10 feet of expansion joints,
 contraction joints, or planes of weakness. If sufficient concrete has not been mixed at the
 time of interruption to form a slab of at least 10 feet long, the excess concrete back to the
 last preceding joint shall be removed and disposed of as directed.
 501.03.16.5--Load Transfer Devices. When dowel assemblies are used, the dowels shall
 be held in position parallel to the surface and center line of the slab.
 For the slip-form method of concrete placement, dowel bars may be placed in the full
 thickness of pavement immediately following the paver with a vibratory inserter in lieu of
 using dowel assemblies. The vibratory dowel bar inserter shall be approved by the
 Engineer. The inserter shall vibrate the dowels into place accurately, at the proper location
 both vertically and longitudinally. An oscillating surface correcting beam shall follow
 immediately behind the inserter to correct surface deformation caused by the inserter.
 When a dowel bar inserter is used, a skewed joint may be permitted with the approval of
 the Engineer.
 The entire length of each dowel will be thoroughly coated with an approved lubricant to
 
 347
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 prevent adherence to the concrete.
 501.03.16.6--Dowel Replacement. When designated on the plans, dowel replacement
 work shall consist of replacing damaged or deteriorated dowels in reconstructed
 contraction joints and both dowels and wooden joint filler boards in reconstructed
 expansion joints.
 Dowel bars shall be the size and length designated on the plans. Wooden joint filler board
 shall conform to the dimensions shown on the plans.
 New expansion boards shall be drilled to fit the new dowels installed. Special care shall
 be taken to ensure that all dowels in the joint remain parallel to the surface of the concrete.
 501.03.17--Final Strike-Off, Consolidation and Finishing.
 501.03.17.1--Sequence. The sequence of operations shall be the strike-off and
 consolidation, floating and removal of laitance, straight-edging, and final surface finish.
 Concrete, as soon as placed, shall be struck off and screeded. An approved portable screed
 shall be used. A second screed shall be provided for striking off the bottom layer of
 concrete if reinforcement is used and the pavement is placed in two layers.
 The screed for the surface shall be at least two feet longer than the maximum width of the
 slab to be struck off. It shall be of approved design, sufficiently rigid to retain its shape,
 and be constructed of metal or of other suitable material shod with metal.
 Consolidation shall be attained by the use of a suitable vibrator or other approved
 equipment.
 In operation the screed shall be moved forward with a combined longitudinal and
 transverse shearing motion, and manipulated so that neither end is raised from the side
 forms during the striking off process. If necessary, this shall be repeated until the surface
 is of uniform texture, true to grade and cross section, and free from porous areas.
 In general, the addition of superficial water to the surface of the concrete to assist in
 finishing operations will not be permitted. If the application of water to the surface is
 permitted, it shall be applied as a fog spray by means of approved spray equipment.
 501.03.17.2--Finishing at Joints. The concrete adjacent to joints shall be compacted or
 firmly placed without voids or segregation against the joint material, and also under and
 around all load transfer devices, joint assembly units, and other features designed to extend
 into the pavement. Concrete adjacent to joints shall be mechanically vibrated as required
 in Subsection 501.03.13.2.
 After the concrete has been placed and vibrated adjacent to the joints, the finishing machine
 shall be brought forward, operating in a manner to avoid damage or misalignment of joints.
 If uninterrupted operation of the finishing machine, to, over, and beyond the joints causes
 segregation of concrete, damage to, or misalignment of the joints, the finishing machine
 shall be stopped when the front screed is approximately eight inches from the joint.
 Segregated concrete shall be removed from in front of and off the joint, and the front screed
 shall be lifted and set directly on top of the joint and the forward motion of the finishing
 
 348
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 machine resumed. When the second screed is close enough to permit the excess mortar in
 front of it to flow over the joint, it shall be lifted and carried over the joint. Thereafter, the
 finishing machine may be run over the joint without lifting the screeds, provided there is
 no segregated concrete immediately between the joint and the screed or on top of the joint.
 501.03.17.3--Machine Finishing. Unless otherwise specified, full width vibration shall
 be performed. If uniform and satisfactory density of the concrete is not obtained by the
 vibratory method at joints, along forms, at structures, and throughout the pavement, the
 Contractor shall furnish equipment and methods which will produce pavement conforming
 to the specifications.
 501.03.17.4--Hand Finishing. Unless otherwise specified, hand finishing methods, other
 than the hand floating method described below, will not be permitted except under the
 following conditions:
 In the event of breakdown of the mechanical equipment, hand methods may be used
 to finish the concrete already deposited on the grade when the breakdown occurs.
 Narrow widths or areas where operation of mechanical equipment is impractical may
 be finished by hand methods.
 501.03.17.5--Floating. After the concrete has been struck off and consolidated, it shall be
 further smoothed and trued by means of a longitudinal float, using one of the following
 methods as specified:
 (a) Hand Method. The hand-operated longitudinal float shall be at least 12 feet long
 and six inches wide, properly stiffened to prevent flexibility and warping. The
 longitudinal float, operated from foot bridges spanning but not touching the
 concrete, shall be worked with a sawing motion while held in a floating position
 parallel to the road centerline, and passing gradually from one side of the
 pavement to the other. Movement ahead along the centerline of the pavement
 shall be in successive advances of not more than one-half the length of the float.
 Excess water and soupy material shall be wasted over the sides on each pass.
 (b) Mechanical Method. The mechanical longitudinal float shall be of a design
 approved by the Engineer, and shall be in good working condition. The float shall
 be accurately adjusted to the required crown, and coordinated with the
 adjustments of the transverse finishing machine so that a small amount of mortar
 is carried ahead of the float at all times. The float shall pass over each area of
 pavement at least two times, but excessive operation over a given area will not be
 permitted. Excess water and soupy material shall be wasted over the sides on each
 pass.
 As an alternative to the mechanical method, the Contractor may use a machine
 composed of a cutting and smoothing float, or floats, suspended from and guided
 by a rigid frame. The frame shall be carried by four or more visible wheels riding
 on and constantly in contact with the side forms, or track line of a slip-form paver.
 If necessary, following one of the preceding methods of floating, long-handled floats
 having blades at least five feet long and six inches wide may be used to smooth and fill in
 open-textured areas in the pavement. Long-handled floats shall not be used to float the
 entire surface of the pavement in lieu of, or to supplement, one of the preceding methods
 
 349
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 of floating. When strike-off and consolidation are done by the hand method and the crown
 of the pavement will not permit the use of the longitudinal float, the surface shall be floated
 transversely by means of the long-handled float. Care shall be taken not to work the crown
 out of the pavement during the operation. After floating, excess water and laitance shall
 be removed from the surface of the pavement by a straightedge 10 feet or more in length.
 Successive drags shall be lapped one-half the length of the blade.
 501.03.17.6--Straight-Edge Testing and Surface Correction. After the floating has been
 completed and while the concrete is still plastic, the surface of the concrete shall be tested
 with a 10 foot straightedge. For this purpose the Contractor shall furnish and use an
 accurate 10-foot straightedge swung from handles three feet longer than one-half the width
 of the slab. The straightedge shall be held in contact with the surface in successive
 positions parallel to the road centerline and the whole area gone over from one side of the
 slab to the other as necessary. Advance along the road shall be in successive stages of not
 more than one-half the length of the straightedge. All depressions found shall be
 immediately filled with freshly mixed concrete, struck off, consolidated, and refinished.
 High areas shall be cut down and refinished. Special attention shall be given to assure that
 the surface across joints meets the requirements for smoothness. Straightedge testing and
 surface corrections shall continue until the entire surface is found to be free from
 observable departures from the straightedge, and the slab conforms to the required grade
 and cross section.
 501.03.18--Final Finish. The surface finish of the concrete shall be that designated on the
 plans and in the bid schedule of the contract. If a finish is not designated, the finish shall
 be a drag finish.
 501.03.18.1--Drag Finish. This finish shall consist of a uniform surface of gritty texture
 produced by dragging a seamless strip of damp burlap or cotton fabric longitudinally along
 the full width of pavement. For pavement 16 feet or more in width, the drag shall be
 mounted on a bridge which travels on the forms or track line. The dimensions of the drag
 shall be such that a strip of burlap or fabric at least three feet wide is in contact with the
 full width of pavement surface while the drag is used. The drag shall consist of at least
 two layers of burlap with the bottom layer approximately six inches wider than the upper
 layer. The drag shall be maintained in a condition that will produce a surface of uniform
 appearance with corrugations approximately one-sixteenth inch in depth. Drags shall be
 maintained clean and free from encrusted mortar. Drags that cannot be cleaned shall be
 discarded and new drags substituted.
 501.03.18.2--Broom Finish. A broom finish shall be applied when the water sheen has
 practically disappeared. The broom shall be drawn from the center to the edge of the
 pavement with adjacent strokes slightly overlapping. The brooming operations shall
 produce corrugations in the surface that are uniform in appearance and not more than 1/16
 inch in depth. Brooming shall be completed before the concrete has set to a degree that the
 surface will be torn or unduly roughened by the operation. The finished surface shall be
 free from rough and porous areas, irregularities, and depressions. Brooms shall be of the
 quality, size, and construction and operated so as to produce a surface finish meeting the
 approval of the Engineer. Subject to satisfactory results being obtained and approval of
 the Engineer, the Contractor will be permitted to substitute mechanical brooming in lieu of
 manual brooming as herein described.
 501.03.18.3--Belt Finish. When straight-edging is complete and the water sheen has
 
 350
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 practically disappeared and just before the concrete becomes nonplastic, the surface shall
 be belted with a two-ply canvas belt eight inches wide and at least three feet longer than
 the pavement width. Hand belts shall have suitable handles to permit controlled, uniform
 manipulation. The belt shall be operated with short strokes transverse to the road centerline
 and with a rapid advance parallel to the center line. Subject to satisfactory results being
 obtained and approval of the Engineer, the Contractor will be permitted to substitute
 mechanical belting in lieu of manual belting as herein described.
 501.03.18.4--Transverse Tine Finish. The surface shall first be given a drag finish. After
 completion of the drag finish, the pavement shall be given an additional texture by
 transverse tining.
 The final surface texture shall be produced with a metal tine finishing device meeting the
 requirements of Subsection 501.03.5.5. The texturing device shall be so constructed and
 operated as to produce uniform parallel grooves perpendicular to the centerline of the
 pavement 1/2 inch on centers and having a depth of 1/8 inch, plus or minus 1/32 inch.
 The metal tine device shall be operated by approved mechanical means when texturing
 main roadway pavement lanes. Manual methods may be used for texturing small irregular
 areas inaccessible to the texturing machine.
 The depth of the finished grooves will be determined by the use of a standard commercial
 tire tread depth measuring gauge with 1/32 inch graduations that can be easily and
 accurately read, a brass wire brush, and a steel straightedge approximately 1/4 inch x 1 inch
 x 12 inches. The Contractor shall furnish this equipment for use by and subject to the
 approval of the Engineer. The method of measuring the depth of grooves will be as set out
 in Department SOP.
 If for any reason the concrete hardens to the extent that the tining equipment does not
 provide grooving in accordance with these requirements, or if rainfall damages the finish
 and the Engineer permits the concrete to remain in place, the Contractor shall use other
 approved devices such as saws to construct the grooves substantially in accordance with
 the requirements specified herein.
 501.03.18.5--Transverse Grooved Finish. After the concrete has cured for a minimum
 of seven (7) days, areas to be transverse grooved shall be grooved with a sawing device
 meeting the requirements of Subsection 501.03.5.5.2. Grooves shall be perpendicular to
 the centerline of the roadway and extend as close as possible to the edge but in no case
 more that two (2) feet from the edge, gutter line, etc. The tolerance for the width of the
 groove is +1/16" to -0" and the tolerance for the depth and spacing of the grooves is ±1/16".
 501.03.18.6--Edging at Forms and Joints. After the final finish, but before the concrete
 has taken its initial set, the pavement along each side of each slab, and on each side of
 transverse expansion joints, formed joints, transverse construction joints, and emergency
 construction joints shall be worked with an approved tool and rounded to the radius
 required by the plans. A well-defined and continuous radius shall be produced and a
 smooth, dense, mortar finish obtained. The surface of the slab shall not be unduly disturbed
 by tilting of the tool during use.
 At all joints, all tool marks appearing on the slab adjacent to the joints shall be eliminated
 by brooming the surface. In doing this, the rounding of the corner of the slab shall not be
 
 351
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 disturbed. All concrete on top of the joint filler shall be completely removed.
 All joints shall be tested with a straightedge before the concrete has set, and correction
 made if one side of the joint is higher than the other, or if they are higher or lower than the
 adjacent slabs.
 501.03.19--Surface Test. It is the intent of these specifications that the finished surface
 will have good riding qualities.
 The smoothness of the surface will be determined by using an Inertial Profiling System
 (IPS) that meets the requirements of Subsection 401.02.6.9 to measure and record
 roughness data in each designated location. Roughness data for each longitudinal profile
 will be reported as a mean roughness index (MRI). MRI is calculated by averaging the
 international roughness index (IRI) values from the two wheelpath profiles. The surface
 shall be tested and corrected to a smoothness index as described herein with the exception
 of those locations or specific projects that are excluded from smoothness testing with an
 IPS.
 The smoothness of the surface will be determined for traffic lanes, auxiliary lanes, climbing
 lane and two-way turn lanes. Areas excluded from a smoothness test with the IPS are
 acceleration and deceleration lanes, tapered sections, transition sections for width,
 shoulders, crossovers, ramps, side street returns, etc. The roadway pavement on bridge
 replacement projects having 1,000 feet or less of pavement on each side of the structure
 will be excluded from a smoothness test. Pavement on horizontal curves having a radius
 of less than 1,000 feet at the centerline and pavement within the super elevation transition
 of such curves are excluded from smoothness testing. Smoothness testing shall terminate
 15 feet from each transverse joint that separates the pavement from a bridge deck, bridge
 approach slab or existing pavement not constructed under the contract.
 During initial paving operations, either when starting up or after a long shut down period,
 the pavement surface will be tested with profilograph as soon as the concrete has cured
 sufficiently to allow testing. Membrane curing damaged during the testing operation shall
 be repaired by the Contractor. The purpose of this testing is to aid the Contractor and the
 Engineer in evaluating the paving methods and equipment. Smoothness measurements
 must be performed at the posted speed limit or 50 miles per hour (±5 miles per hour),
 whichever is lower. This speed requirement will be waived for all lightweight profilers.
 Measurements will be made in both wheel paths of exterior and interior lanes. The wheel
 paths shall be designated as being located three feet (3’) and nine feet (9’) from centerline
 or longitudinal joint, respectively. Beginning and ending latitude and longitude
 coordinates shall be required on each smoothness test. Testing will also be required on
 sections that have been surface corrected. No smoothness testing shall be performed when
 there is moisture of any kind on the pavement surface.
 The surface will be accepted on a continuous basis for pavement smoothness. Continuous
 reporting is based upon all MRI values for a specified running interval. These values are
 averaged and presented at the midpoint of the specified running interval. The last 15 feet
 of a day's work may not be obtainable until the work is continued and for this reason may
 be included in the subsequent section.
 Smoothness tolerances shall be applied to concrete pavements based on the following
 pavement categories:
 
 352
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 Category A applies to the following pavement constructions.
 
 
 New construction projects
 
 Category B applies to the following pavement constructions.
 
 
 Rehabilitation projects
 
 For all projects, the surface smoothness data shall be reported by two MRI methods.
 1.
 2.
 
 A continuous 528-foot long interval MRI report
 A continuous 25-foot short interval MRI report
 
 Category A projects shall have a long interval surface MRI of not more than 60 inches per
 mile. Areas of the surface with localized roughness greater than 130 inches per mile as
 determined by the continuous short interval report will be identified for correction by the
 Project Engineer.
 Category B projects shall have a long interval surface MRI of not more than 70 inches per
 mile. Areas of the surface with localized roughness greater than 140 inches per mile as
 determined by the continuous short interval report will be identified for correction by the
 Project Engineer.
 Areas of localized roughness exceeding the continuous 25-foot interval thresholds shall be
 corrected regardless of the 528-foot interval MRI value of the section. Surface correction
 by grinding shall be performed in accordance with Subsection 401.02.6.7. The Contractor
 shall also make other necessary surface corrections to ensure that the final mean roughness
 index of the section meets the above requirements.
 Corrections shall be made using an approved profiling device or by removing and replacing
 the pavement as directed by the Engineer. Corrective work shall be performed at no
 additional cost to the State.
 Each area or section of pavement removed shall be at least 10 feet in length and at least the
 full width of the lane involved. When it is necessary to remove and replace a section of
 pavement, any remaining portion of the slab adjacent to the joints that is less than 10 feet
 in length shall also be removed and replaced. The new surface shall be textured as specified
 in the contract.
 Where surface corrections are made, the Contractor shall reestablish the surface texture to
 a uniform texture equal in roughness to the surrounding uncorrected pavement. This work
 shall be at no additional cost to the State.
 Corrective work shall be completed prior to determining pavement thickness.
 501.03.20--Curing and Protection. Immediately after the finishing operations have been
 completed and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of the
 newly placed concrete shall be covered and cured in accordance with one of the following
 methods. On hot or windy days, and when directed by the Engineer, the surface of the
 fresh concrete shall be kept damp by fogging with water until the normal curing operation
 
 353
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 can be performed. In all cases in which curing requires the use of water, the curing shall
 have prior right to all water supplies. Failure to provide sufficient cover material of
 whatever kind the Contractor may elect to use, or lack of water to adequately take care of
 both curing and other requirements, shall be cause for immediate suspension of concreting
 operations. The concrete shall not be left exposed for more than 1/2 hour between stages
 of curing or during the curing period. Unless otherwise specified, the curing period shall
 be 72 hours.
 501.03.20.1--White Pigmented Membrane. The entire surface of the pavement shall be
 sprayed uniformly with white pigmented curing compound immediately after the finishing
 of the surface and before the set of the concrete has taken place. The curing compound
 shall not be applied during rainfall or when there is a water sheen on the pavement.
 Curing compound shall be applied under pressure at the rate of one gallon to not more than
 150 square feet for all surface finishes except transverse grooving. For transverse groove
 finishes, the application shall be at the rate of one gallon to not more than 120 square feet.
 The spraying equipment shall be of the fully atomizing type equipped with a tank agitator.
 At the time of use, the compound shall be in a thoroughly mixed condition with the
 pigments uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle. During application, the compound
 shall be stirred continuously by effective mechanical means. Hand spraying of odd widths
 or shapes and on concrete surfaces exposed by the removal of forms will be permitted.
 Curing compound shall not be applied to the faces of joints to be sealed, and those faces
 shall be cured by other approved means for at least 72 hours.
 The curing compound shall be of such character that the film will harden within 30 minutes
 after application. Should the film become damaged from any cause within the curing
 period, the damaged portions shall be repaired immediately with additional compound.
 Upon removal of side forms, the sides of the slabs exposed shall be protected immediately
 to provide a curing treatment equal to that provided for the surface.
 501.03.20.2--White Polyethylene Sheeting. The top surface and sides of the pavement
 shall be entirely covered with polyethylene sheeting. The pieces used shall be lapped at
 least 18 inches. The sheeting shall be so placed and weighted down that it will remain in
 direct contact with the surface covered. The sheeting shall be wide enough to extend 18
 inches beyond the edges of the slab being cured.
 501.03.20.3--Curing in Cold Weather. When concrete is being placed and the air
 temperature may be expected to drop below 35°F, a sufficient supply of straw, hay, grass,
 or other suitable blanketing material shall be provided to protect the work. The Contractor
 shall be responsible for the quality and strength of the concrete placed during cold weather,
 and all concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost
 to the State. The Department reserves the right to perform destructive or nondestructive
 testing for evaluation of damage caused by cold weather.
 501.03.20.4--Protection of Pavement. The Contractor shall protect the pavement from
 both public traffic and traffic caused by employees and agents. This shall include
 watchmen to direct traffic and the erection and maintenance of warning signs, lights,
 pavement bridges, or crossovers, etc. The plans or special provisions will indicate the
 location and type of device or facility required to protect the work and provide adequately
 for traffic. The Contractor shall have materials available at all times to protect unhardened
 
 354

 concrete from rain.
 All damage to the pavement, occurring prior to final acceptance, shall be repaired or the
 pavement replaced.
 501.03.21--Removing Forms. Except for auxiliary forms used temporarily in widened
 areas or unless otherwise provided, forms shall not be removed from freshly placed
 concrete until it has set for at least 12 hours. Forms shall be removed carefully so as to
 avoid damage to the pavement. After the forms have been removed, the sides of the slab
 shall be cured as outlined in one of the methods indicated in the previous subsection.
 Honeycombed areas shall be satisfactorily repaired.
 501.03.22--Sealing Joints. Joints to be sealed shall be filled with joint sealing material
 meeting the requirements of Subsections 707.02.1.3 or 707.02.1.4, as shown on plans, and
 Subsection 707.02.1.5 before the pavement is opened to traffic, and as soon after
 completion of the curing period as is feasible.
 501.03.22.1--Cleaning. Joints shall be clean, dry and frost free when the sealant is applied.
 Formed joints shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove all form release agents, curing
 compound residue, laitance, or any other foreign materials. All joints shall be thoroughly
 cleaned by sandblasting each face separately to the depth of the sealer and backer rod. The
 cleaning operation of existing joints shall ensure that the concrete joint surfaces which are
 to receive the new joint sealant and backer rod are free of all debris, discoloration and stain;
 as well as any and all other forms of contamination. If a clean exposed concrete surface
 cannot be obtained by sandblasting, the joints shall be refaced with a power driven concrete
 saw with diamond and/or abrasive blades. The refaced joints shall be washed and
 sandblasted as set forth above. Immediately prior to installation of the backer rod, the
 joints shall be cleaned with compressed air which is free of moisture and oil. Wiping
 fingers on cleaned surface of joints shall not show evidence of dust. The joints shall be
 completely free of sand, oil and moisture.
 Material in expansion joints shall be removed to the required depth with a power saw and/or
 router in such a manner as not to damage the expansion material which is to remain in
 place.
 501.03.22.2--Installing Backup Material. After the final cleaning, a resilient rod type
 backup material shall be installed with a positioning device to ensure conformity with the
 dimensions shown on the plans. The rod shall be compatible with the sealant and no bond
 or reaction shall occur between the rod and the sealant.
 501.03.22.3--Installing Sealant. The installation of the sealant is to be performed as soon
 after placing the backer rod as reasonably possible to ensure that joints are still clean and
 dry. In the event a joint does become contaminated, damp, or wet, the backer rod is to be
 removed and the joint cleaned and dried with a new backer rod reinstalled prior to placing
 the sealant. The ambient temperature at time of placement must be 40°F or higher. The
 sealant shall be applied by pumping only. The pump shall be of sufficient capacity to
 deliver the necessary volume of material to completely fill the joint to the specified width
 and height of sealant in one pass. The nozzle shall be of sufficient size and shape to
 introduce the sealant inside the joint with sufficient pressure to prevent voids occurring in
 the sealant and force the sealant to make contact with the joint faces. The sealant shall be
 tooled to provide the specified recess depth, thickness and shape as shown on the plans.
 
 355
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 Sufficient force or pressure shall be applied to the sealant in this tooling operation to force
 the sealant against the joint faces to ensure satisfactory wetting and bonding. The sealant
 shall be placed to reasonably close conformity with dimensions and shape shown on the
 plans. Any unreasonable deviation will be cause for rejection and necessary corrective
 action will be made by the Contractor.
 501.03.22.4--Cleaning Pavement. After a joint has been sealed, all surplus sealant on the
 pavement shall be promptly removed.
 501.03.23--Opening to Traffic. The Engineer will decide when the pavement may be
 opened to traffic. The pavement shall not be opened to traffic until test specimens have
 attained a compressive strength of 3500 pounds per square inch. If such tests are not
 performed, the pavement shall remain closed to traffic for 14 days, or 28 days if Type IP
 cement or Type I or II cement with fly ash is used, from the date of placement. Prior to
 opening to traffic, the pavement shall be cleaned.
 501.03.24--Tolerance in Pavement Thickness. The thickness of the pavement will be
 determined from cores taken in accordance with Subsection 501.03.24.1 and tested in
 accordance with Subsection 700.03. Holes remaining in the pavement after coring shall be
 completely filled by the Contractor, at no additional cost to the State, with concrete of the
 same quality as used to construct the pavement.
 It is anticipated that when concrete pavement is placed over an asphalt treated base, the
 concrete may penetrate the asphalt treated base. Volumes of concrete that penetrate the
 asphalt treated base will not be included in the volume of concrete pavement to be paid for.
 When cores are taken to determine the thickness of concrete pavement, it is anticipated a
 layer of asphalt treated base will adhere to the bottom of the core. Prior to determining the
 thickness of the concrete pavement, all particles of asphalt treated base will be removed
 from the bottom of the core. Measurement of core thicknesses will be made from top of
 concrete pavement to the top of the asphalt treated base.
 501.03.24.1--Thickness Determination. For the purpose of establishing adjusted unit
 prices for pavement, units to be considered separately are defined as 1000 linear feet of
 pavement in each traffic lane. Each traffic lane will be divided into units of 1000 feet of
 pavement, excluding exceptions and omissions, beginning at the end of the pavement
 nearest the Beginning of Project. The last unit in each lane will be the length remaining
 except that if the length is less than 100 feet, it will be included in the previous unit. Each
 project under the same contract will be separated into units independently of the other
 projects. One core will be taken at random by the Department in each unit. If the
 measurement of the core from a unit is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan
 thickness, full payment will be made. When the measurement is deficient by more than
 0.2 inch and not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness, that measurement will
 represent the one-third of the section in which it falls, and one additional core will be taken
 at random in each of the remaining thirds of the section. The average thickness of these
 three cores will determine the average thickness for that unit. An adjusted unit price as
 provided in Subsection 501.05.2 will be paid for the unit represented.
 Other areas such as intersections, entrances, crossovers, ramps, etc., will be considered as
 separate units, and the thickness of each unit will be determined separately. Small irregular
 unit areas may be included as part of another unit. The areas to be included in each unit
 
 356
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 will be predetermined. At points the Engineer may select at random in each unit, one core
 will be taken for each 1000 square yards of pavement, or fraction thereof, in the unit. If
 the core taken is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan thickness, full payment will
 be made. If the core is deficient in thickness by more than 0.2 inch but not more than 1.0
 inch from plan thickness, two additional cores will be taken at random from the area
 represented and the average of the three cores determined. If the average measurement of
 these three cores is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan thickness, full payment
 will be made. If the average thickness of the three cores is deficient more than 0.2 inch but
 not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness, an adjusted unit price as provided in
 Subsection 501.05.2 will be paid for the area represented by these cores.
 In calculating the average thickness of the pavement, measurements which are in excess of
 the specified thickness by more than 0.2 inch will be considered as the specified thickness
 plus 0.2 inch, and measurements which are less than the specified thickness by more than
 1.0 inch, excluding exploratory cores, will be considered as the specified thickness minus
 1.0 inch in the average.
 When the measured thickness of a core is less than the plan thickness by more than 1.0
 inch, the actual thickness of the pavement in this area will be determined by taking
 exploratory cores at not less than 10 foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction
 from the affected location until in each direction a core is found which is not deficient by
 more than 1.0 inch. Areas found deficient in thickness by more than 1.0 inch will be
 evaluated by the Engineer; and if in the judgment of the Engineer, the deficient areas
 warrant removal, they shall be removed and replaced with pavement of the thickness shown
 on the plans without cost to the Department. If the Engineer determines that the deficient
 areas do not warrant removal, the pavement may be left in place with no payment to the
 Contractor, or may be removed and replaced at the Contractor's option. Exploratory cores
 for deficient thickness will not be used in averages for areas for adjusted unit price.
 501.03.24.2--Alternate to Coring. For contracts that involve the placement of less than
 7,500 square yards of pavement, cores will not be taken unless the State Materials Engineer
 elects to do so.
 For such contracts, the Project Engineer’s measurements will be used to determine the
 pavement thickness as follows:
 The Engineer will accurately measure, by taut stringline or instrument from referenced
 grades, and record the grade on which the pavement is to be placed. After the
 pavement is in place, the Engineer will accurately measure and record the grade of the
 top of the pavement above each point where the initial measurements were made.
 From the measurements thus made, the thickness of each area will be determined,
 unless the State Materials Engineer elects to take the cores as provided in this
 subsection. In the latter case the measurements made from cores will govern.
 501.03.24.3--Pavement Cracking. Concrete pavement with full-depth cracks or
 misplaced joints shall be removed and replaced at no additional expense to the Department.
 Load transfer devices shall be established in these replaced panels in a manner sufficient
 to meet the designed load transfer requirements of the original pavement.
 Any partial depth surface cracking or other surface distress shall be immediately repaired
 
 357
 
 Section 501
 
 Section 501
 
 by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Department. The Contractor shall submit
 to the Engineer for concurrence, a plan describing the materials and methods to be used
 when making these repairs. Concurrence with the plan does not relieve the Contractor
 from providing a satisfactory repair at the time of final inspection of the project. Should
 the repair fail to produce satisfactory results prior to the final inspection of the project, the
 Contractor shall develop and submit a new plan for repairing the cracked or distressed
 areas.
 501.04--Method of Measurement. Concrete pavement will be measured by the square
 yard complete in place and accepted. The width for measurement will be the plan width,
 including widening where called for, or as otherwise authorized in writing by the Engineer.
 The length will be measured horizontally in accordance with Section 109.
 Where integral or raised edge curb is constructed, the width of the pavement will include
 the width of the curb.
 When specified for payment, expansion joints complete and accepted, will be measured by
 the linear foot.
 Reinforced concrete lug anchors will be measured by the linear foot.
 Reinforcement and other materials for which no pay item is included in the contract will
 not be measured for separate payment.
 When rehabilitating existing pavement, dowels will be measured per each and wooden
 joint filler board shall be measured by the linear foot. All concrete removed will be
 measured by the square yard under pay item 202-B.
 When a pay item is included in the contract, transverse grooving will be measured by the
 square yard, complete in place and accepted. For bridge decks, the quantity will be
 computed by measuring the limits of transverse grooving shown in the plans. When not
 shown, the quantity will be computed by measuring the bound area between the face of
 barrier rail and the length of the span. For concrete and bridge end pavements, the quantity
 will be computed by measuring by the limits of transverse grooving shown in the plan.
 When not shown, the quantity will be computed by measuring the bound area between the
 edge of pavement and the length of the pavement.
 501.05--Basis of Payment.
 501.05.1--General. Concrete pavement will be paid for at the contract unit price per square
 yard, adjusted when applicable in accordance with Subsections 501.05.2 and 501.05.3.
 Expansion joints will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot.
 Reinforced concrete lug anchors will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot.
 Transverse grooving, measured as prescribed above, will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per square yard, which price shall be full compensation for all grinding, cleaning and
 sweeping, and for all labor, equipment, tools and incidentals necessary to complete the
 work.

 When the thickness of an area of pavement is deficient by more than 1.0 inch and, in the
 judgment of the Engineer, the deficient area should be removed, the area shall be removed
 and replaced at no additional costs the State with pavement of the specified thicknesses.
 If, in the judgment of the Engineer, the deficiency does not warrant removal, the deficient
 area may be left in place with no payment to the Contractor, or may be removed and
 replaced at no additional cost to the Department, at the Contractor's option.
 501.05.3--Price Adjustments for Smoothness. For all concrete projects, when the MRI
 for the final surface is less than or equal to forty-five inches per mile (45.0 inches / mile)
 on the long interval report, a unit price increase will be added. The adjusted unit price will
 be computed using the contract unit price of the concrete pavement. This adjusted unit
 price will apply to the total area for the lane width represented by given segment. Projects
 will be considered for incentive pay based on the following guidelines for the long interval
 surface lift MRI.

 CONCRETE PAVING SCHEDULE
 DURING NIGHTTIME HOURS
 
 During nighttime operations, concrete pours may be made anytime between
 sundown and sunrise without regard to predicted high temperatures.
 503.03.7--Opening to Traffic. The traffic lane shall be opened within 72 hours of concrete
 placement and may be opened earlier if a 2500 psi compressive strength is obtained and
 verified by a cylinder break or maturity meter probe. The approval of the Engineer must
 be obtained prior to opening the lane. Side forms shall be removed and the shoulder
 repaired with asphalt pavement, and the area cleared of equipment and waste materials
 prior to opening to traffic.
 The sampling and testing frequency for concrete test cylinders shall be at least two
 cylinders per day per section of lane for which an individual lane closure is effected and
 concrete pavement is replaced.
 The Contractor must make arrangements to have the concrete compressive cylinders tested
 by an acceptable commercial laboratory. Results from laboratory tests may be accepted
 verbally to expedite the opening of traffic to a section of closed roadway, but the Contractor
 must furnish the Engineer with certified test reports within three days. Any
 misrepresentation of test cylinders which allows traffic to be opened in areas that did not
 meet minimum requirements will result in the Contractor removing and replacing the
 repair(s) represented by the cylinder at no additional cost to the State.
 If the Contractor has previously developed the strength/maturity relationship for the
 mixture, an approved maturity meter probe may be used to determine concrete strengths.
 A maturity meter probe shall be inserted into the last concrete placed that represents the
 pavement area to be tested. The maximum amount of concrete which may be represented
 by a maturity meter probe is 50 cubic yards. The pavement may be opened to traffic when
 maturity meter reading indicates that the required in place strength is obtained.
 Procedures for using the maturity meter and developing the strength/maturity relationship
 shall follow the requirements of AASHTO T325. Validation of the maturity curves shall
 be made at least once for every 500 cubic yards produced of each concrete mixture used.
 Validation of the maturity curve shall be considered acceptable when the results of
 compressive strength tests are within 10% of the predicted value determined by the
 maturity curve. If the 10% requirement is not met, the existing maturity curve shall no
 longer be used and a new maturity curve shall be developed prior to continuing to use the
 maturity method to estimate the in-place compressive strength.
 Technicians using the maturity meter or calculating strength/maturity graphs shall be
 required to have at least two hours of training prior to using the maturity equipment.
 Training and maintaining a list of approved maturity technicians shall be the responsibility
 of the Mississippi Concrete Industries Association.
 503.04--Method of Measurement. Replacement of the concrete pavement will be
 measured for payment by the square yard complete in place. Saw cuts will be measured
 for payment by the linear foot when a pay item is included in the contract proposal.
 Concrete for base repair will be measured by the cubic yard complete in place. Smooth
 dowel bars and tie bars will be measured per each complete in place.

 No separate measurement will be made for reinforcing steel, wire mesh, longitudinal joints,
 polyethylene sheeting and asphalt pavement for repair of shoulders and maintenance of
 traffic items required.
 The plans may also provide for welding of the reinforcing steel as an optional method
 available to the Contractor. This method reduces the width of the lap area from 20 inches
 to eight inches which will reduce the size of the repair areas. If the Contractor elects to use
 the optional method, the subsequent reduction in plan quantities will not be justification
 for adjustment of contract unit prices as provided in Subsection 104.02.
 503.05--Basis of Payment. The accepted quantities of saw cuts, concrete for base repairs,
 smooth dowel bars, tie bars, and concrete pavement will be paid for at the contract unit
 prices which shall be full compensation for completing the work, furnishing all labor,
 equipment, tools, materials, and bituminous plant mix required for shoulder repair.

 Section 508
 
 508.03.1--Cleaning. Joints shall be clean, dry and frost free when the sealant is applied.
 Formed joints shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove all form release agents, curing
 compound residue, laitance, or any other foreign materials. All joints shall be thoroughly
 cleaned by sandblasting each face separately to the depth of the sealer and backer rod. The
 cleaning operation of existing joints shall ensure that the concrete joint surfaces which are
 to receive the new joint sealant and backer rod are free of all debris, discoloration and stain,
 as well as any and all other forms of contamination. If a clean exposed concrete surface
 cannot be obtained by sandblasting, the joints shall be refaced with a power driven concrete
 saw with diamond and/or abrasive blades. The refaced joints shall be washed and
 sandblasted as set forth above. Immediately prior to installation of the backer rod, the
 joints shall be cleaned with compressed air which is free of moisture and oil. Wiping
 fingers on cleaned surface of joints shall not show evidence of dust. The joints shall be
 completely free of sand, oil and moisture.
 Material in expansion joints shall be removed to the required depth with a power saw and/or
 router in such a manner as not to damage the expansion material which is to remain in
 place.
 508.03.2--Installing Backup Material. When shown as a requirement of the contract and
 after the final cleaning, a resilient rod type backup material shall be installed with a
 positioning device to ensure conformity with the dimensions shown on the plans. The rod
 shall be compatible with the sealant and no bond or reaction shall occur between the rod
 and the sealant. Unless otherwise designated, the rod diameter shall be one-eighth of an
 inch (1/8") greater than the joint width.
 508.03.3--Installing Silicone Sealant. The installation of the sealant is to be performed
 as soon after placing the backer rod as reasonably possible to ensure that joints are still
 clean and dry. In the event a joint does become contaminated, damp, or wet, the backer
 rod is to be removed and the joint cleaned and dried with a new backer rod reinstalled prior
 to placing the sealant. The ambient temperature at time of placement must be 40°F or
 higher. The sealant shall be applied by pumping only. The pump shall be of sufficient
 capacity to deliver the necessary volume of material to completely fill the joint to the
 specified width and height of sealant in one pass. The nozzle shall be of sufficient size and
 shape to introduce the sealant inside the joint with sufficient pressure to prevent voids
 occurring in the sealant and force the sealant to make contact with the joint faces. This is
 especially critical in large joints. The sealant, if not of the self-leveling type, shall be tooled
 to provide the specified recess depth, thickness and shape as shown on the plans. Sufficient
 force or pressure shall be applied to the sealant in this tooling operation to force the sealant
 against the joint faces to ensure satisfactory wetting and bonding. The sealant shall be
 placed to reasonably close conformity with dimensions and shape shown on the plans. Any
 unreasonable deviation will be cause for rejection and necessary corrective action will be
 made by the Contractor.
 508.03.4--Cleaning Pavement. After a joint has been sealed, all surplus sealant on the
 pavement shall be promptly removed.
 508.03.5--Opening to Traffic. Traffic shall not be permitted over the sealed joints until
 the sealant is tack free.
 508.04--Method of Measurement. Silicone sealed joints will be measured by the linear
 foot.

 construction procedures required under other provisions of the contract.
 511.02--Blank.
 511.03--Construction Requirements.
 511.03.1--Equipment. The roller shall consist of a single-axle trailer-type roller or a
 loaded truck having a single rear axle. The axle shall be loaded to a gross weight equal to
 or greater than the maximum legal load for a tandem axle on the highway on which the
 project is located but not to exceed 25 tons, and the Contractor shall provide the means
 necessary for the Engineer to determine that these weight requirements are being met.
 The wheels shall be equipped with pneumatic tires capable of being inflated to a minimum
 inflation pressure of 100 psi. Tires may contain liquid if the Contractor so desires. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with verification of gross axle weight and tire
 pressures.
 If a trailer type roller is used, it shall be towed by a rubber tired prime mover capable of
 maintaining a speed of two miles per hour. The prime mover with roller attached shall be
 capable of executing a 180° turn within a width of 30 feet.
 511.03.2--Protection. Rolling shall be conducted so as to avoid damage to existing
 structures and features designated to remain. Damage to such structures and features shall
 be repaired or the items replaced, in kind, at no additional cost to the State. The loaded
 roller shall not encroach upon bridge end pavement or, in the absence of bridge end
 pavement, within 20 feet, or greater distance when directed, of bridge abutments except
 under specific authority granted to cross a bridge.
 Live loadings on any bridge shall not exceed the statutory loading permitted on the bridge
 except the Department may consider an overload permit for individual cases. All pertinent
 information, including proposed frequency and size of loadings and type and exact location
 of bridges shall be furnished the Department in order that a comprehensive study may be
 made.
 
 370
 
 Section 511
 
 Section 511
 
 Loading limits on bridges under the jurisdiction of agencies other than the Department are
 set by the agencies, independently of statutory limits and the Department.
 511.03.3--Construction Methods. The sequence of rolling and the operating speed of the
 roller shall meet the approval of the Engineer. A roller coverage is defined as a single pass
 over a single traffic lane.
 Generally, one coverage will be sufficient to determine slabs requiring treatment. Extra
 coverages may be required when necessary to confirm slabs to be treated.
 It is the intent of this specification to hold the rolling operation to a minimum, and rolling
 coverages considered unnecessary by the Engineer are to be omitted.
 Prerolling may begin as early as 4:00 A.M. and continue as long as the surface temperature
 of the pavement remains below 85°F.
 The above work shall be included and correlated with the general sequence of operations
 set out in Subsection 403.03.5.2.
 511.04--Method of Measurement. Prerolling will be measured by the square yard. The
 area of prerolling will be computed by using the horizontal length along the centerline of
 the roadway and the width, unless otherwise specified, of the concrete pavement in or under
 the traffic lane being prerolled.
 Only areas designated by the Engineer to be rolled will be measured for payment.
 Preliminary and stability testing as provided in Section 512 will not be included in
 measurement for prerolling.
 511.05--Basis of Payment. Prerolling will be paid for at the contract unit price per square
 yard, which shall be full compensation for completing the work.

 SECTION 512 - PRESSURE GROUTING CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 512.01--Description. This work consists of locating unstable concrete pavement, drilling
 of holes and the pumping of a slurry type grout mixture to stabilize and underseal the
 pavement. The grout mixture shall form a hard and insoluble mass that will effectively fill
 the voids. Pavement that remains unstable after an initial undersealing and stabilizing
 attempt shall be re-grouted as directed by the Engineer.
 When an asphalt overlay is required, it shall be the Contractor's responsibility to schedule
 operations in such a manner that the first course of overlay will be placed at the earliest
 practicable time and no later than fourteen days after the pavement has been stabilized.
 When designated on the plans, this work shall also consist of drilling holes in the shoulder
 adjacent to cracks at the edge of the pavement and the pumping of a slurry type grout
 
 371
 
 Section 512
 
 Section 512
 
 mixture to fill the cracks to the surface of the cement treated shoulder. If in the Engineer's
 opinion, the type of grout being used proves to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor shall
 switch to a Type 5 grout at no change in contract price.

 personnel shall be available to assist in preliminary testing, when required by the
 contract, and stability testing.
 
 373
 
 Section 512
 
 Section 512
 
 (h) Equipment to measure pavement lift shall consist of no less than four gauges
 mounted on a measuring device or devices that is capable of detecting movement
 on each side of a joint or crack and the adjoining shoulder simultaneously. The
 equipment shall make such measurements to 0.001 of an inch.
 512.03.3--Testing.
 512.03.3.1--General. When testing is required, it is intended to locate all pavements
 having a deflection exceeding 0.030 of an inch. Testing may begin as early as 4:00 A.M.
 and continue as long as the surface temperature of the pavement remains below 85°F.
 512.03.3.2--Preliminary Testing by the Department. When the pavement has been
 tested and marked by the Department, preliminary testing will not be required by the
 Contractor.
 512.03.3.3--Preliminary Testing by the Contractor. When the contract includes a unit
 bid price for testing and it has not been performed by the Department, all of the project or
 designated areas shall be tested by the Contractor. Testing shall be performed as follows:
 One set of gauges will be positioned on each side of a joint or crack near the pavement
 edge. The gauges will be zeroed with no load on either side of the joint or crack. The test
 truck will then be moved into position and stopped with the center of the nearest test axle
 about one foot from the joint or crack and the outside test wheel about one foot from the
 pavement edge. The gauges will be read and the test truck will then move across the joint
 or crack to a similar position for a second reading of the gauges. This operation will be
 repeated for each joint or crack to be tested. The inspector will be responsible for reading
 the gauges and subsequent recording. All locations with movement of more than 0.030 of
 an inch will require pressure grouting.
 When testing shoulders, gauge positioning and testing shall be the same as indicated above
 for roadway pavement. The Engineer may adjust the position of the gauges to meet field
 conditions.
 512.03.3.4--Stability Testing. After the designated areas have been pressure grouted in
 accordance with these specifications, they shall be retested in accordance with Subsection
 512.03.3.3 when the contract includes a unit bid price for testing.
 Any undersealed pavement with movement of 0.030 of an inch or more shall be re-grouted
 and tested as directed.
 Any pavement which continues to show movement in excess of that specified after two
 properly performed groutings may be accepted, or the slab may be removed and replaced
 as directed by the Engineer.
 512.03.4--Drilling Holes. The hole pattern and pumping sequence shown on the plans
 shall be used, except when modified to use drilling holes made from previous undersealing
 work. The Contractor may alter the hole pattern with the Engineer's approval. However,
 only the actual number of holes drilled will be measured for payment.
 The holes shall be of a size and shape that best provide a positive seal for the pumping
 nozzle. The holes shall be drilled to a depth of approximately eight inches below the
 
 374
 
 Section 512
 
 Section 512
 
 bottom of the concrete for the initial undersealing unless the Engineer approves an alternate
 depth. The number, depth and location of holes for undersealing after the initial operation
 shall be approved by the Engineer.
 When pressure grouting cracks located in the shoulders at the edge of the pavement, the
 holes in the shoulders shall be located as shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 These holes are to be drilled below the treated base.
 512.03.5--Cleaning Holes. Prior to pumping the grout, compressed air shall be used to
 remove debris and to help provide a passage for the grout.
 512.03.6--Pumping the Grout. The nozzle of the discharge hose shall be secured in the
 hole in a manner that provides a seal adequate to maintain the grout pressure underneath
 the slab. The nozzle end shall not extend below the bottom of the concrete. Pumping will
 continue until a clear flow of grout protrudes from an adjacent hole, joint or crack, or until
 the pavement begins to lift. This procedure will be repeated in other holes until all voids
 are supposedly filled. Plugging of holes during grouting operations will not be permitted.
 Additional evidence that grouting should cease is a rapid rise of the pavement, or a rise of
 the adjacent shoulder. A minimum lifting of the pavement will generally be required to
 move grout into the cavities and voids, however, the lifting shall not exceed 0.050 of an
 inch. Movement of the pavement and adjacent shoulder will be monitored by the
 Contractor with equipment as required by Subsection 512.03.2(h). Care shall be taken not
 to crack the pavement by differential lifting. During pumping, very close attention shall
 be given to the lift measuring device to prevent excessive pumping pressures.
 Moderate to major pavement cracks or pavement broken during the pumping operation due
 to the Contractor's negligence will be repaired or removed and replaced at the Contractor's
 expense.
 512.03.7--Clean Up and Opening to Traffic. Deposits of mud and/or grout on the
 pavement or shoulders shall be removed and the surface cleaned before traffic is permitted
 on the section. Other debris, bags, spillage, etc., shall be removed from the right-of-way
 each day.
 Traffic shall not use the undersealed pavement for at least three hours after grouting.
 Grouting operations shall cease at least three hours before sundown or earlier as necessary
 to permit the grout to harden at least three hours.
 512.03.8--Permanently Sealing Holes. When pavement is not to be overlaid all grout
 shall be removed from the holes to the bottom surface of the concrete pavement and filled
 with a stiff sand-cement mixture or an approved quick setting patching material. Filled
 holes that ravel out or become damaged shall be repaired. All holes from previous
 undersealing work that were used by the Contractor shall also be similarly repaired at no
 cost to the Department.
 512.03.9--Stability Tests. The test shall not be conducted until the undersealed pavement
 has been open to traffic for at least twelve hours. These tests shall be conducted in
 accordance with Subsection 512.03.3.4. Based upon these test results the pavement will
 be accepted or designated for further undersealing or replaced as directed by the Engineer.

 constructed and separately supported and braced that the walls may be poured and
 
 378
 
 Section 601
 
 Section 601
 
 the wall forms removed as for wall forms not under stress. The Engineer may
 require a detailed plan of the proposed method of forming for approval. When
 this method of forming is used, the deck forms shall be in place and adequately
 and independently supported throughout before pouring the walls. Deck forms
 shall overlay the top edge and be flush with the face of the inside wall forms, but
 shall not be dependent upon any part of the inside wall forms for support. The
 intersection of the wall and deck forms shall be mortar tight. The wall forms may
 be constructed slightly less than the specified inside clear height of the structure

 When this method is used, the concrete in the wall shall be poured flush with the
 top of the deck form.
 (b) At the option of the Contractor, the walls may be formed, adequately braced, and
 poured before the deck forms are in place. In this case the forms may be removed
 as for walls not under stress. Before erecting any part of the forming for the top
 slab, the concrete in the walls shall have attained the age or the strength specified
 for the removal of wall forms under stress.
 (c) The Contractor may elect to form and adequately support and brace the wall and
 deck forms as a composite unit before pouring the walls. In this case the outside
 forms may be removed as indicated for wall forms not under stress provided
 adequate provisions are made for forming the outer (vertical) surfaces for the
 subsequent deck pour. The inside wall forms shall remain in place as indicated
 for wall forms under stress.
 601.03.6.4--Damage to Previously Placed Concrete. In the event previously placed
 concrete is damaged, all work on the affected structure shall cease immediately for an
 engineering assessment of the damage and the corrective work to be performed. No
 additional work shall be performed until this determination has been made, and the
 Engineer has given the Contractor approval to proceed with the corrective work and
 subsequent construction. All corrective work required shall be performed by the
 Contractor at no additional cost to the State.
 601.03.7--Foundations and Footings. Foundations for structures shall be prepared in
 accordance with the requirements and provisions of Section 206.
 All footings shall be poured "dry." Where footings can be placed in the "dry" without the
 use of cribs or cofferdams, the Engineer may permit back forms to be omitted, and concrete
 poured against the faces of the excavation.
 601.03.8--Placing Reinforcing Steel. Reinforcing steel shall be placed in accordance with
 the requirements of Section 602 and as shown on the plans.
 601.03.9--Handling and Placing Concrete. Handling and placing concrete shall be in

 Contractor shall verify the quantity, size, and shape of the reinforcement for compliance
 
 380
 
 Section 602
 
 Section 602
 
 with the structural drawings and make the necessary corrections, if any, before ordering.
 In the case of box culverts, box bridges, inlets, etc., verification shall be made after the
 Engineer has furnished the Contractor with a list of the staked lengths or depths for
 structures. Errors in the bar list and bending schedule shall not be cause for adjustment of
 the contract unit price, and the Contractor shall be fully responsible for all expenses caused
 by the Contractor’s failure to furnish the proper size, shape, length, and quantity of
 reinforcing steel required.
 When stipulated in the contract, or at the option of the Contractor when not stipulated,
 order lists and bending diagrams shall be furnished to the Engineer for approval. In these
 cases no materials shall be ordered until the lists and bending diagrams have been
 approved. The approval of order lists and bending diagrams by the Engineer will in no
 way relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the correctness of the lists and diagrams.
 All expense incident to the revision of materials furnished in accordance with such lists
 and diagrams to make them comply with the design drawings and lengths as staked by the
 Engineer shall be borne by the Contractor.
 602.03.2--Protection of Materials. Steel reinforcement shall be protected in accordance
 with Subsection 805.03.1.

 direction alternate intersections may be tied.
 All reinforcing steel shall be securely spaced from the forms and between layers by means
 of approved precast mortar blocks of minimum size for adequacy, or metal spacers or
 devices.
 Where possible, all spacer devices shall be arranged so that they cannot be detected in the
 completed structure. Metal devices that are in contact with the exterior surface of the
 concrete shall be one of the types specified in Subsection 711.02.7. Gravel, pieces of
 broken stone or brick, metal pipe, and wooden blocks shall not be used for spacers or chairs.
 Reinforcement shall be accurately and securely placed to the dimensions shown on the
 plans, within a tolerance of one-half inch, then inspected and approved by the Engineer
 prior to the placing of concrete. Concrete placed in violation of this provision may be
 rejected and its removal required.
 Substitution of different size bars will be permitted only with specific authorization by the
 Engineer. If steel is substituted, it shall have a cross sectional area equivalent to or greater
 than the design area.
 602.03.4.1--Splicing. Except where shown on the plans, splicing of bars will not be
 permitted without the written approval of the Engineer. Splices, when permitted, shall be
 staggered as far apart as possible.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, spliced bars shall be lapped 20 diameters. In lapped
 splices, the bars shall be placed in contact and wired together in a manner that will maintain
 
 381
 
 Section 602
 
 Section 602
 
 the minimum clear distance specified between bars and to the surface of the concrete.
 Welding of reinforcing steel will be permitted only if detailed on the plans or if authorized
 by the Engineer in writing. If welded, it shall conform to AWS Recommended Practices
 for Welding Reinforcing Steel, Metal Inserts, and Connections in Reinforced Concrete
 Construction.
 602.03.4.2--Lapping of Mesh and Bar Mats. Sheets of mesh or bar mat reinforcement
 shall overlap each other sufficiently to maintain a uniform strength and shall be securely
 fastened at the ends and edges. The edge lap shall be at least one mesh in width.
 602.04--Method of Measurement. Reinforcing steel will be measured in pounds based
 on the computed weight of the reinforcement shown on the plans or authorized. In cases
 where a structure is measured and paid for by the unit, complete in place, no measurement
 of reinforcing steel will be made.
 The weight of plain or deformed bars and bar mats will be computed from the weights
 shown in the table of areas and weights in AASHTO M31.
 The weight for payment of steel fabric reinforcement will be computed from the theoretical
 weight of plain wire. If the weight per unit of area of the fabric is shown on the plans, that
 weight will be used for measurement.
 The weight for payment of structural steel reinforcement will be the theoretical weight of
 the material used.
 No allowance will be made for clips, wire, separators, wire chairs, and other material used
 in fastening the reinforcing in place. If bars are substituted upon the Contractor's request
 and as a result more steel is used than specified, only the quantity specified will be
 measured.
 When splice laps, other than those shown on the plans, are made for the convenience of the
 Contractor, the extra steel will not be included in the measurement.
 602.05--Basis of Payment. Reinforcing steel will be paid for at the contract unit price per
 pound which shall be full compensation for completing the work.
 Payment will be made under:

 manufacturer of the joint material to the extent that the line will be water proofed
 
 386
 
 Section 603
 
 Section 603
 
 both from infiltration and exfiltration insofar as is practicable. Evidence of
 leakage shall be corrected immediately.
 (d) Evidence of leakage or suspected leakage may be cause for requiring the
 Contractor to perform testing to determine the leakage present. In the case of
 sanitary sewer lines, leakage exceeding the tolerance permitted under the local
 governing code, or in the absence of such code the tolerances permitted by
 MDEQ, Office of Pollution Control, will not be allowed.
 Leakage in excess of the tolerances permitted shall be corrected by reworking the
 line as necessary. Retesting may be required if deemed by the Engineer to be
 indicated. All testing shall be at no additional cost to the Department.
 603.03.5--Relaid Pipe. These construction specifications shall equally apply to relaid
 conduits. In addition, conduit salvaged for relaying shall be cleaned of all foreign material
 prior to reinstallation. All pipe damaged through carelessness or negligence on the part of
 the Contractor shall be replaced by new pipe or approved pipe at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 Pipe and end sections designated for removal and relaying shall be removed in accordance
 with the provisions of Subsection 202.03.4.
 603.03.6--Field Strutting. Where required by the plans, the vertical diameter of round
 flexible pipe shall be uniformly increased five percent by means of jacks applied after the
 entire line of pipe has been installed on the bedding but before backfilling. The vertical
 elongation shall be uniformly maintained by means of sufficient sills and struts or by
 sufficient horizontal ties as specified. Only horizontal ties shall be used for paved invert
 pipe.
 Ties and struts shall be removed after the embankment is completed and compacted.
 603.03.7--Backfilling. Conduit shall be inspected before backfill is placed. Conduit found
 to be out of alignment, unduly settled, or damaged shall be taken up and relaid or replaced.
 After approval of conduit, it shall be backfilled with specified material in accordance with
 Subsection 203.03.8.6.

 so as not to interfere with existing underground utilities. Care shall also be taken to keep
 the disturbed area of construction to a minimum.
 The line and grade and the limits, if any, of placement to be made by conventional open
 trench methods for each line of pipe will be established as provided in Subsection 105.08.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, sections of steel pipe shall be joined by welding for
 the full circumference of the pipe to form a continuous, rigid, watertight structure of the
 required length. Welding shall be performed in accordance with Subsection 810.03.5.
 603.03.9.1--Jacking. The designated strength of the pipe to be jacked is determined for
 the final loading under the embankment. Additional reinforcement or strength of pipe
 required to withstand jacking pressure shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Extra
 strength pipe furnished by the Contractor shall be at no additional cost to the Department.
 Pipe larger than a 3½-inch ID shall not be pushed or jacked without boring or otherwise
 removing the soil as the pipe is advanced.
 Suitable pits or trenches, when required, shall be excavated for the jacking operation and
 for placing the end joints of pipe. Where necessary, they shall be securely sheeted and
 braced to prevent caving.
 Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities
 by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere
 with the operation of the facility or weaken the roadbed or structure.
 Jacks for forcing the pipe through the roadbed shall have a jacking head constructed in
 such a manner as to apply uniform pressure around the ring of the pipe. The pipe to be
 jacked shall be set on guides braced together to properly support the section of the pipe and
 direct it to the proper line and grade. In general, roadbed material shall be excavated just
 ahead of the pipe, the excavated material removed through the pipe, and the pipe then
 forced through the roadbed into the excavated space.
 When requested, the Contractor shall furnish for the Engineer's approval a plan showing
 proposed method of handling. The plan shall include the design for the jacking head, and
 show the jacking support or back stop, arrangement and position of jacks, pipe guides, etc.
 complete in assembled position. The approval of this plan by the Engineer will not relieve
 the Contractor from the responsibility of obtaining the specified results.
 The diameter of the excavation shall conform to the outside circumference of the pipe as
 closely as practicable. Voids that develop during the installation operation and that are
 determined by the Engineer to be detrimental to the work shall be pressure grouted with an
 approved mix.
 
 388
 
 Section 603
 
 Section 603
 
 The distance that the excavation extends beyond the end of the pipe will depend upon the
 character of the excavated material, but shall not exceed two feet in any case. This distance
 shall be decreased on instructions from the Engineer if the character of the material being
 excavated makes it desirable.
 The pipe shall be jacked from the low or downstream end. Variation in the final position
 of the pipe from the line and grade established will be permitted only to the extent of two
 percent in lateral alignment and one percent in vertical grade, provided that the final grade
 of flow line is in the direction designated.
 The Contractor may use a cutting edge around the head end that extends a short distance
 beyond the pipe end and has inside angles or lugs to keep the cutting edge from slipping
 back into the pipe.
 When jacking of pipe is begun, the operation shall be carried on without interruption,
 insofar as practicable, to prevent the pipe from becoming firmly set in the embankment.
 All pipe damaged in jacking operations shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor
 at no additional cost to the State.
 Pits or trenches excavated to facilitate jacking operations shall be backfilled immediately
 after the jacking has been completed.
 603.03.9.2--Boring. The boring shall proceed from a pit provided for the boring equipment
 and workmen. Excavation for pits and installation of shoring shall be as outlined under
 jacking. The location of the pit shall meet the approval of the Engineer. The holes are to
 be bored mechanically. The boring shall be done using a pilot hole. By this method an
 approximate two-inch pilot hole shall be bored the entire length of the crossing and shall
 be checked for line and grade on the opposite end of the bore from the work pit. This pilot
 hole, when approved, shall serve as the centerline of the larger diameter hole to be bored.
 Excavated material shall be placed near the top of the working pit and disposed of as
 required. The use of water or other fluids in connection with the boring operation will be
 permitted only to the extent to lubricate cuttings as provided herein. Jetting will not be
 permitted.
 In unconsolidated soil formations, a gel-forming colloidal drilling fluid consisting of at
 least 10 percent of high grade carefully processed bentonite may be used to consolidate
 cuttings of the bit, seal the walls of the hole, and furnish lubrication for subsequent removal
 of cuttings and installation of the pipe immediately thereafter.
 Allowable variation from line and grade shall be as specified under jacking. Precise
 measures are to be taken to prevent overcutting. Overcutting in excess of one-half inch
 shall be remedied by pressure grouting.
 603.03.9.3--Grouting, Backfilling, and Cleanup. After the jacked conduit is in place, all
 joints in concrete pipe shall be cleaned carefully and pointed from the inside to afford a
 smooth continuous interior surface.
 Extension of the line beyond that required to be jacked or bored shall be by conventional
 methods as set out in this section.
 
 389
 
 Section 603
 
 Section 603
 
 As soon after jacking as possible, the interstices around the outside of the pipe shall be
 filled by pressure grouting. The grout mixture shall consist of fine sand or silt, Type I
 cement of not less than 15 percent by volume, and water. The grout shall be placed through
 holes bored at such intervals that the grout can be determined as rising in an adjacent hole
 at least six inches above the top of the pipe. The water content of the grout shall be the
 minimum necessary to provide proper placement. Grouting shall be performed by qualified
 personnel with equipment especially designed for the purpose.
 At the end of each day's grouting operation, or at the completion of the grouting operation
 for each line of pipe, whichever occurs first, the conduit shall be carefully inspected on the
 inside and all grout that penetrated the pipe shall be removed and the inside surface wiped
 clean. Other waste grout that will impair the work shall be removed and disposed of.
 After successive operations are completed, all sheeting, shoring, etc. shall be removed,
 excavations backfilled to the surface of the existing ground or as directed, the backfill
 compacted in accordance with the specifications, and all surplus material disposed of to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 603.04--Method of Measurement. The lengths of pipe and precast box culverts will be
 measured by the linear foot by multiplying the number of commercial lengths installed by
 the nominal length per section, with the exception that portions of commercial lengths
 extending more than four feet beyond the ends of conduit actually required or at the face
 of structures will not be measured for payment.
 Unless otherwise indicated on the plans, sections of lines of conduits placed by
 conventional methods will not be measured as pipe jacked or bored.
 End sections, headwalls, elbows, branch connections, and other appurtenances for which
 pay items are listed will be measured by the number of units of the kind and size specified.
 Concrete collars used for connecting non-rigid pipe to concrete end sections will not be
 measured for payment and the costs shall be absorbed in the cost of other pay items.
 Pipe removed and relaid will be measured by the linear foot. End sections removed and
 relaid will be measured by the unit.
 Excavation for conventionally installed conduits will be measured and paid for as set out
 in Section 206. Excavation for conduits placed by jacking or boring will not be measured
 for separate payment.
 Excavation for precast box culverts will be measured in cubic yards as set out in Section
 206 for cast-in-place box culverts of comparable sizes.
 603.05--Basis of Payment. Accepted quantities of pipe and precast box culverts will be
 paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot.
 End sections, headwalls, elbows, branch connections, and other appurtenances for which
 pay items are listed in the contract will be paid for at the contract unit price per each.
 Pipe removed and relaid will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot. End
 sections removed and relaid will be paid for at the contract unit price per each.

 guard rail in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably close conformity with
 the lines and grades shown on the plans or established by the Engineer. This work shall
 also include the installation of reflectors on guard rail posts and the installation of guard
 posts.
 When the work requires the removal and replacement of guardrail on a facility opened to
 traffic, the materials necessary for replacement will be on hand before removal begins. The
 Contractor shall not begin work on any section of guardrail until preparations have been
 made to complete the installation of the section, including posts, rail, anchors, and
 hardware as a continuous operation. Once work has been initiated on a section, the work
 shall be prosecuted to its completion unless inclement weather or other conditions beyond
 the control of the Contractor interfere with the work. Uncompleted guardrail or special
 end sections shall not be left exposed to the travelling public without the approval of the
 Engineer. If approval is granted, the uncompleted section must satisfactorily be marked
 with drums, barricades, or other devices, as directed by the Engineer, at no additional cost
 to the Department. In no case will uncompleted guardrail or special end sections be
 allowed to remain over a weekend or holiday period.
 606.02--Materials. Unless otherwise specified, all materials shall conform to the
 requirements shown on the plans and set forth in Section 712. Reflectors shall be of the

 606.03--Construction Requirements.
 606.03.1--Erection of Guard Posts. Generally, guard post will be constructed of timber
 post. However, in certain circumstances, guard post may be constructed of steel with
 special requirements as detailed on special design sheets in the plans. The posts shall be
 set plumb and firm to the depth indicated and accurately lined, spaced, and graded. After
 the posts are in place, the holes shall be backfilled with suitable material which shall be
 thoroughly compacted in approximate six inch layers by tamping. Posts shall not be sawed
 or cut after treatment. If set posts are found to be in improper position with reference to
 alignment or grade, they shall be removed and reset properly. If the posts are found too
 high they may be driven to the proper elevation provided the tops of the posts are protected
 by suitable driving caps.
 Wood guard rail posts and guard posts may be erected by driving or by a combination of
 drilling and driving when after demonstration at the project site the Engineer approves the
 results as being equal to or better than the results that can be obtained by erecting posts in
 drilled holes and backfilling. Acceptability of driving or combined drilling-driving will be
 contingent on the following conditions:
 (a) Use of approved and proven mechanical driving equipment;
 (b) Maintenance of acceptable results without impairing the structural integrity of
 adjacent materials or structures;
 (c) Use of drills to penetrate courses that may resist penetration by driving. When
 drills of nominal post-size are used the void between the post and the edge of the
 hole shall be filled with Grade AC-13 asphalt. Holes larger than nominal postsize drilled through paved surfaces or cement treated courses shall be properly
 backfilled with hot or cold bituminous pavement;
 (d) Out-of-tolerance posts shall be pulled and properly replaced or reset, and all
 disrupted portions of the roadbed structure restored as directed; and
 
 407
 
 Section 606
 
 Section 606
 
 (e) Mutilated posts shall be pulled and properly replaced, and all disrupted portions
 of the roadbed structure restored in kind or as directed.

 plans.
 606.03.3--Erection of Rails. All fabrication and forming of rail elements shall be
 completed prior to application of the shop paint. Field punching, cutting, burning, or
 welding will not be permitted, except where specifically authorized by the Engineer and
 subject to the conditions thereof.
 The rail shall be erected in a manner that results in a smooth, continuous, taut rail that
 conforms to the line and grade shown on the plans or established. In the erection of rail,
 consideration shall be given to the prevailing temperature and the anticipated rise and fall
 of temperature ultimately affecting the length of the rail.
 Where required, ends of rail shall be flared within the limits shown on the plans or
 established.
 Bolts and clips used for fastening rails or fittings to posts shall be drawn up tightly, and all
 bolts, except "take up" device bolts, shall be of such length as to not project beyond the nut
 more than the limits shown on the plans. Sawing of ends of bolts to meet this requirement
 will be permitted.
 606.03.4--Repairing Rails and Fittings. Where the galvanizing on guardrail or fittings
 has been damaged, the coating shall be repaired by re-galvanizing or the surface repaired
 by painting with two coats of zinc oxide paint approved by the Engineer.
 606.03.5--Reflectors. Reflector units shall be installed in conformity with details shown
 on the plans and in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Where holes
 are required to be bored in posts or other units, the holes shall be bored prior to the required
 painting. The reflectors shall be installed after all painting is completed.
 606.04--Method of Measurement. Guard rail will be measured by the linear foot along
 the face of the rail from center to center of end posts for each complete section and will
 include posts and other elements of the completed section.
 Special sections will be measured per each or linear foot, as indicated on the plans.

 requirements of the plan standards shall be provided and operated to control the speed and
 sequence of movement of the traffic.
 A longitudinal pavement edge that traffic is expected to move across should have an
 elevation difference of not more than 2¼ inches. If the pavement edge is more than 1½
 inches and less than or equal to 2¼ inches, uneven pavement signs will be required as
 shown in the plans or contract documents. If the pavement edge is less than or equal to 1½
 inches, no uneven pavement signs will be required. Transverse pavement joints shall be
 sufficiently tapered to allow for the safe movement of traffic.
 When a paving operation produces a longitudinal pavement edge that traffic is expected to
 move across, the adjacent lane shall be constructed to eliminate any uneven pavement edge
 within 48 hours, unless prohibited by weather conditions or an emergency arises.
 All failed areas that have been removed and all trenches shall be filled and compacted to
 the elevation of the existing pavement before work is discontinued for the day. In
 emergencies, the Engineer may permit the use of approved temporary materials for
 backfill, provided the temporary materials will be adequate to facilitate normal safe
 movement of traffic. Separate measurement for payment will not be made for the
 furnishing, placing, maintaining, removing, and disposing of such temporary materials.
 Except under the following conditions, no portion of the roadway intended to be used for
 maintenance of traffic shall be blocked after work hours. In exceptional cases when all
 efforts have been made to restore the surface of the roadway and because of equipment
 failure or other uncontrollable causes complete restoration is not possible before work must
 be discontinued for that day, the Contractor shall provide adequate warning signals,
 barricades, other appropriate devices, and flaggers, appropriately placed or stationed for
 the protection of the public. The Engineer may also require the use of a pilot vehicle as
 provided herein.
 The Contractor shall be required to place granular material on the shoulders at any time a
 differential of two and one-quarter (2¼) inches or more exists between the present
 pavement edge and the shoulder grade. This condition may exist prior to any preliminary
 leveling, after the placement of the preliminary leveling, after the placement of the surface
 course. In locations where a 2¼-inch differential exists between the pavement edge and
 the shoulder material and along a section which lies outside a work zone delineated with
 traffic control devices such as drums, this condition shall be corrected by the placement of
 the shoulder material to correct the differential.
 All centerline, lane lines, edge lines and no-passing stripes that have been covered or
 removed during the day's operations shall be replaced with temporary stripe before work
 is discontinued for the day or as soon thereafter as weather conditions will permit, except
 that:
 (1) Replacement of no-passing stripes may be delayed for a period not to exceed three
 (3) days for a two or three lane road.
 (2) Temporary edge lines on projects requiring shoulders constructed of granular
 material may be delayed for a period not to exceed three (3) days.
 Temporary edge lines placed on the final pavement course of projects requiring paved
 shoulders with surface treatment may be placed on the adjacent shoulder as close to the
 
 445
 
 Section 618
 
 Section 618
 
 permanent location as possible until the surface treatment is placed. When the edge lines
 are obliterated by the placement of the surface treatment, the edge lines shall be placed in
 the permanent stripe location. The replacement of edge lines may be delayed for a period
 not to exceed three (3) days for a two or three-lane roads.
 Temporary no-passing stripe is not considered a major item of work and such stripe
 eliminated because of placing the next course prior to expiration of the 3-day period shall
 not result in a monetary adjustment to the Contractor as provided in Subsection 104.02.
 All temporary stripe shall be placed in accordance with the plans and Subsection 619.03.2.
 In addition to the temporary no-passing stripe, the Contractor shall erect standard "DO
 NOT PASS," "NO-PASSING ZONE," and "PASS WITH CARE" signs in accordance with
 plan details or as specified in the MUTCD. These signs shall be erected prior to the
 obliteration of the no-passing stripe and shall be maintained in good order until the
 Engineer permits their removal.
 Permanent pavement markings are to be applied no sooner than 10 days nor later than 45
 days after placement of the final lift of pavement. When shoulder paving or placement of
 granular material adjacent to the pavement edge is required and upon approval of the
 Engineer, the permanent edge stripe may be delayed until a section, not to exceed five
 miles, of the shoulder work is complete. When the project length is less than five miles,
 the edge stripe shall be placed no later than 15 days after completion of the adjacent
 shoulder.
 Permanent pavement markings on surface treatment shall be delayed until the maximum
 amount of seal aggregate has embedded and all loose material is broomed from the surface.
 All temporary stripe shall be maintained in good order until placement of the permanent
 pavement markings or placement of the next pavement course or until removed.
 Maintenance of temporary stripe may require more than one application over the life of the
 project. Payment will be made for one application only.

 of individual stripes. In the case of skip lines, the measurement will include skips. The
 length used to measure centerline, lane lines and edge stripes will be the horizontal length
 computed along the stationed control line. Detail traffic stripe will be measured by the
 linear foot from end-to-end of individual stripes. Measurement will be made along the
 surface of each stripe and will exclude nominal skip intervals where specified. Stripes
 more than four inches in width will be converted to equivalent lengths of four-inch stripe.
 Legend, which is to include railroad markings, pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines, will
 be measured by the square foot or linear foot. Pay areas of individual letters and symbols
 will usually be shown on the plans and measured by the square foot. Transverse railroad
 bands, pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines will generally be measured by the linear foot,
 and stripes more than four inches in width will be converted to equivalent lengths of fourinch widths.
 Each impact attenuator installation, including one replacement package, will be measured
 per each installation as shown on the plans. Replacement packages, excluding the package
 included with the initial attenuator, will be measured per each in accordance with these
 specifications.
 Initial snap-back delineators will be measured per each. Replacement will be measured as
 follows:
 (a) Replace reflective material measured as 1/4 unit.
 (b) Replace complete tube measured as 1/3 unit.
 (c) Replace shock cord adapter measured as 1/3 unit.
 Changeable message signs, as described above, will be measured per each. When directed,
 separate measurements will be made for items included in the contract and required for
 temporary site preparation for the sign as referenced in Subsection 619.03.10. Materials
 for which no pay items are included in the contract will not be measured for separate
 payment. Separate measurements will not be made for moving the changeable message
 sign to a new location, but materials used for which pay items are included in the contract
 and are necessary for repositioning the sign as directed by the Engineer will be measured
 
 477
 
 Section 619
 
 Section 619
 
 for separate payment. Removal of materials used for site preparation for changeable
 message signs will not be measured for separate payment.
 Portable traffic signals of the type specified will be measured per each.
 The lengths of median barrier, including remove and reset median barrier, will be measured
 per linear foot by multiplying the number of commercial lengths installed by the nominal
 length of the barrier.
 619.05--Basis of Payment. Traffic control devices will be paid for at the contract unit
 price for the units specified. Devices that have been measured for payment and
 subsequently require repair or replacement will be dropped from payment on future
 estimates unless satisfactorily repaired or replaced.
 Payment for devices for which no pay items are contained in the contract will be included
 in the unit prices of contract items and/or in the lump sum contract price for Maintenance
 of Traffic.
 Payment for items required by the Engineer for temporary location of the changeable
 message sign, and for which pay items are included in the contract, will be made by the
 individual pay item. No additional payment will be made for working outside the planned
 indicated project limits.
 Payment for removal of materials used for site preparation at changeable message sign
 locations shall be included in the contract price for Maintenance of Traffic.
 Portable traffic signals of the type specified will be paid for at the contract unit price per

 SECTION 623 - DRAINAGE WICKS
 623.01--Description. This section shall cover the work of furnishing and installing
 drainage wicks of the types, sizes and at the designated locations, all in accordance with
 the details specified on the plans and in these specifications or as directed by the Engineer.
 This section shall also cover the work of drilling holes through the embankment layer at
 locations specified on the plans or directed by the Engineer. Jetting methods will not be
 permitted.
 
 487
 
 Section 623
 
 Section 623
 
 The Engineer may vary the depths, spacings or number of drainage wicks to be installed,
 and may revise the plan limits for this work as necessary.
 623.02--Materials. The drainage wick shall be a prefabricated type composed of a
 drainage plastic core wrapped in a non-woven geotextile. The core shall be fabricated with
 suitable drainage channels.
 The non-woven geotextile wrap shall meet the following minimum specifications:
 
 Property
 Tensile Strength
 Permittivity
 
 Value
 30 lbs./in.
 0.15 sec-1
 
 Test Method
 ASTM D 4632
 ASTM D 4491
 
 The core material shall be constructed in such a manner that the filter geotextile has a
 minimum surface area of 3.50 square inches per inch that is not in contact with the core
 material. The core channels shall have a minimum free volume of 0.16 cubic inch per inch.
 The Contractor will be required to furnish to the Engineer three copies of a certified test
 report from the producer, showing all data required to indicate compliance with the above
 specifications and with certification that the material meets such specifications.
 The certifications by the manufacturer or distributor will be prima-facie evidence of the
 materials meeting the specified requirements. All drainage wick materials will, however,
 be subject to approval by the Engineer.
 623.03--Construction Requirements.
 623.03.1--Equipment. In general, it shall be the Contractor's responsibility to select the
 proper size and amount of equipment to provide the desired results, but certain basic items
 shall be provided, as outlined herein. The type of carrier to be used will depend upon the
 desired installation force, but it shall be equipped with a mandrel or sleeve of minimum
 cross sectional area not to exceed fourteen square inches which will protect the wick
 material from tears, cuts and abrasions during installation.
 The Contractor shall secure approval of all equipment prior to beginning work and any
 equipment found unsatisfactory shall be promptly replaced or supplemented. All
 equipment approved for use shall be on a trial basis. If the equipment proves unsatisfactory
 after a short test section, it shall be removed, replaced or supplemented as deemed
 necessary to accomplish the desired results.
 623.03.2--Installation. At least two weeks prior to the installation of the drainage wicks,
 the Contractor shall submit details of the sequence and method of installation to the
 Engineer for review and approval. Approval by the Engineer of the sequence and method
 of installation shall not necessarily constitute acceptance for the duration of the project. If,
 at any time, the Engineer considers that the method of installation does not produce a
 satisfactory drainage wick, the Contractor shall alter the installation method and/or
 equipment as necessary to comply with these specifications.
 The Contractor will be permitted to use augers or other approved methods to loosen stiff
 upper soils prior to the installation of the drainage wicks. These holes shall have a
 
 488
 
 Section 623
 
 Section 623
 
 maximum diameter just large enough to permit the mandrel or sleeve carrying the wick
 and wick anchorage to penetrate the embankment and shall extend not more than two feet
 into the underlying highly compressible soil.
 The drainage wick shall be installed at the designated locations using a mandrel or sleeve
 that completely encloses the drainage wick, thereby protecting it from tears, cuts and
 abrasions during installation. The mandrel, with the wick inside, shall be forced vertically
 into the ground to an elevation specified on the plans or directed by the Engineer. The
 mandrel shall be retracted leaving the wick in place to function as a vertical drain. The
 wick shall be cut neatly at its upper end with an eight-inch length of wick material
 protruding above the existing embankment surface.
 The equipment shall be carefully checked for plumbness prior to advancing each wick and
 must not deviate more than one inch per foot from the vertical. Wicks that are out of their
 proper location by more than six inches, damaged in construction or improperly completed
 shall be rejected by the Engineer, and no compensation will be allowed for said rejected
 wicks.
 The Contractor shall provide a suitable means of making a linear determination of the depth
 of the drainage wick at any given time and of the quantity of wick material used at each
 vertical drain location.
 The Contractor shall observe precautions necessary for protection of instrumentation
 devices and shall replace at no additional cost to the State any equipment that is damaged
 or becomes unreliable as a result of the Contractor’s operations.
 Embankment or surcharge to be placed over an area in which drainage wicks are installed
 shall be allowed to settle the period of time as specified on the plans. In the case of bridge
 approach embankment fills, no end bent piling may be driven until the specified waiting
 period has elapsed. The waiting period begins when the total embankment and/or
 surcharge has been constructed to grade.
 If no settlement monitoring devices are specified on the plans, the Contractor may propose
 to provide, install and maintain subsidence/settlement plates and essential appurtenances
 for the Engineer to measure the amount of settlement that occurs. If the data taken from
 these settlement plates show that the amount of settlement is sufficient, or that the rate of
 settlement has declined to the point that little additional settlement will occur during the
 specified waiting period, the Contractor will be relieved of the total waiting period
 requirement. In the case of bridge approach embankment fills, the end bent piling may
 then be driven without further delay. The settlement measuring devices shall be approved
 by the Engineer.
 623.04--Method of Measurement. Drainage wicks will be measured by the linear foot
 for the full length of drainage wicks, complete and in place. No separate measure for
 payment will be made for loosening of stiff upper soils by augering or other approved
 methods.
 623.05--Basis of Payment. Drainage wicks, measured as prescribed above, will be paid
 for at the contract unit price per linear foot, which price shall be full compensation for all
 drilling of holes, furnishing all materials, installation of drainage wicks and for all labor,
 equipment, tools and incidentals necessary to complete the work.

 providing constant agitation of paint, traveling at controlled speeds, with one or more paint
 "guns" synchronized to begin and cut off paint flow automatically for skip lines, and
 subject to manual control for continuous lines of varying length. The machine, or a
 separate machine, shall be equipped with a glass bead dispenser adjusted and so
 synchronized with the paint applicator as to distribute the beads uniformly on the painted
 lines within 10 seconds. Calibration charts and devices for measurement of tanks shall be
 provided by the Contractor for determining the quantity being applied.
 All painting equipment and operations shall be under the control of an experienced
 technician thoroughly familiar with the equipment, materials, and marking layouts.
 625.03.2--Preparation of Surface. All areas to be painted shall be thoroughly cleaned.
 Cleaning may be done by hand brooms, rotary brooms, air blast, scrapers, or whatever
 combination of equipment is necessary to clean the pavement thoroughly without damage
 to the surface. Before edge striping, particular care shall be taken to remove all vegetation,
 loose soil, and the like from the area to be painted. Should other methods fail, the surface
 shall be wetted with a water jet and scrubbed as necessary to dislodge all foreign material.
 After washing, the surface shall be allowed to dry thoroughly, and all films of dried mud
 apparent after surface drying shall be removed before application of paint. Painting shall
 follow as closely as practicable after the surface has been cleaned and dried, but no paint
 shall be applied until the surface has been inspected and permission given to proceed. The
 cost for preparing the surface shall be included in the contract unit prices for the marking
 items.
 Upon request, the Engineer will establish control points for markings, by type and color,
 
 490
 
 Section 625
 
 Section 625
 
 at necessary intervals not to exceed 600 feet. The Contractor shall preserve and apply
 markings in conformity with control points established.
 625.03.3--Application. The paint shall be applied when the ambient temperature is no less
 than 50oF, the pavement surface is properly prepared and the temperature of the pavement
 surface is no less than 50oF.
 For four-inch temporary traffic stripe, paint and Class A glass beads shall be uniformly
 applied at the rate of not less than one gallon of paint and six pounds of beads per 264
 linear feet of four-inch stripe. For six-inch permanent traffic stripe, paint and Class B glass
 beads shall be uniformly applied at the rate of not less than one gallon of paint and twelve
 pounds of beads per 176 linear feet of six-inch stripe. For six-inch permanent high build
 traffic stripe, paint and Class B glass beads shall be uniformly applied at the rate of not less
 than one gallon of paint and twelve pounds of beads per 140 linear feet of six-inch stripe.
 The length and width of lines shall be within a tolerance of plus or minus three inches and
 plus or minus 1/8 inch, respectively. For skip markings, the tolerance for intervals shall
 not exceed the line length tolerance.
 Markings applied at less than minimum material rates, deviating from true alignment by
 more than one inch in 50 feet, exceeding stipulated length and width tolerances, and
 showing light spots, faulty distribution of beads, smears, or other deficiencies or
 irregularities shall be removed and replaced. Removal methods shall be in accordance with
 Subsection 619.03.2.
 625.03.4--Protection. The newly painted markings shall be protected so that, insofar as
 possible, paint will not be picked up by the tires of passing vehicles. Warning signs shall
 be placed at the beginning of a wet line and at points well in advance of the marking
 equipment. For the benefit of the Contractor, small flags or other similarly effective small
 objects may be placed near freshly applied lines at frequent intervals to reduce crossings
 by traffic. Damaged portions of stripes shall be effaced and replaced by the Contractor at
 no additional cost to the State.
 Operations shall be conducted so that traffic can move without undue hindrance. When
 public traffic is being maintained, warning signs at the starting end shall be moved forward
 as sections of stripe dry sufficiently to prevent pick-up under traffic. Reference is made to
 Subsection 710.02.2.2 for the particular paint involved.
 625.03.5--Detail Traffic Stripe. Detail traffic stripe shall be those short stripes, exclusive
 of lane and edge striping of the main facility, at exit and entrance ramps, turnouts, turn
 bays, and other locations indicated on the plans. When shown on the plans or directed by
 the Engineer, detail stripe of the color, width, and length shall be placed in accordance with
 the provisions and requirements of this section.
 625.03.6--Legend. Legend shall be applied by the use of templates cut to the dimensions
 shown on the plans, or by other methods approved by the Engineer that will provide a clean
 cut, uniform, and workmanlike appearance. All other requirements for legend shall be in
 accordance with the applicable materials and construction requirements of this section.
 Legend that fails to have a uniform, satisfactory appearance either by day or by night shall
 be corrected by the Contractor or removed and replaced at no additional cost to the State.

 625.04--Method of Measurement. Painted traffic markings, of the type specified, will be
 measured by the linear foot, square foot, or mile, from end-to-end of individual stripes.
 In the case of skip lines the measurement will include skips. The length used to measure
 centerline, lane lines and edge stripes will be the horizontal length computed along the
 stationed control line.
 Detail traffic stripe will be measured by the linear foot from end-to-end of individual
 stripes. Measurement will be made along the surface of each stripe and will exclude
 nominal skip intervals where specified. Stripes more than six inches in width will be
 converted to equivalent lengths of six-inch stripe.
 Legend, which includes railroad markings, pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines, will be
 measured by the square foot or linear foot. Pay areas of individual letters and symbols will
 usually be shown on the plans and measured by the square foot. Transverse railroad bands,
 pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines will generally be measured by the linear foot, in which
 case, stripes more than six inches in width will be converted to equivalent lengths of sixinch widths.
 625.05--Basis of Payment. Painted traffic markings will be paid for at the contract unit

 Section 626
 
 that firmly embeds them into the surface of the thermoplastic material for at least one half
 of the diameter of the larger gradation sizes of the beads. The dispensing equipment shall
 be equipped with an automatic cut-off control for the application of the beads that is
 synchronized with the cut-off of the thermoplastic material.
 626.03.1.2--Construction Details. Application of thermoplastic material shall be made
 only in periods of dry weather and when the temperature of the pavement surface is at least
 55°F. The pavement shall be surface dry, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, before
 application will be permitted. The application temperature of the thermoplastic material
 shall be between 400° and 450°F.
 Upon request, the Engineer will establish the control points for markings at necessary
 intervals not to exceed 600 feet on tangents and more often on curves. All additional work
 necessary to establish intermediate control points shall be performed by the Contractor.
 On curves, unsightly variations from the normal curvature will not be permitted unless
 specifically shown on the plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 Immediately before application, the areas to receive markings shall be cleaned thoroughly
 in accordance with Subsection 625.03.2. On areas of pavement cured with compound, the
 membrane shall be removed completely by shot blasting, sand blasting or other approved
 method.
 Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, traffic stripes that are coincidental with the
 thermoplastic stripe shall be removed prior to placement of the thermoplastic material,
 except that temporary paint stripe may be left in place when satisfactorily placed in the
 proper location. Any temporary stripe not covered shall be removed. Payment for removal
 of stripe, except temporary stripe, will be made under Section 202.
 When thermoplastic material is to be applied to concrete pavements or bridge surfaces, a
 binder-sealer of the type and amount recommended by the manufacturer of the
 thermoplastic material shall be applied prior to placement of the thermoplastic material.
 On other pavement surfaces, a binder-sealer shall be applied under those conditions
 recommended by the manufacturer of the thermoplastic material.
 The thickness of the thermoplastic material, when measured above the surface plane of the
 pavement, shall be within tolerance of the specified thickness. Unless otherwise specified
 in the plans or contract documents, the thickness shall be 90 mils for edge lines, center
 lines, lane lines, barrier lines and detail stripe including gore markings, and 120 mils for
 crosswalks, stop lines, and railroad, word and symbol markings. The measured thickness
 at the center of the line shall be no less than the specified thickness with the edge of the
 line not thinner than 75% of the specified center thickness and will be checked at intervals
 of one mile or less as directed by the Engineer.
 Any thermoplastic traffic marking less than the required thickness shall be corrected by
 overlaying with an additional application of thermoplastic material. Any such required
 overlay will be no less than 30 mils. Although a tolerance of 25 percent from center to
 edge is allowed, a consistent underrun of any amount in thickness will not be acceptable.
 Additional beads by the drop-on method shall be applied at a rate of not less than three
 pounds of beads per 100 feet of six-inch stripe. When double drop thermoplastic stripe is

 from end-to-end of individual stripes. In the case of skip lines the measurement will
 include skips. The length used to measure centerline, lane lines and edge stripes will be
 the horizontal length computed along the stationed control line.
 Detail traffic stripe will be measured by the linear foot from end-to-end of individual
 stripes. Measurements will be made along the surface of each stripe and will exclude skip
 intervals where skips are specified. Stripes more than six inches in width will be converted
 to equivalent lengths of six-inch stripe.
 Legend, which is to include railroad markings, pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines, will
 be measured by the square foot or linear foot. Pay areas of individual letters and symbols
 will usually be shown on the plans and measured by the square foot. Transverse railroad
 bands, pedestrian crosswalks and stop lines will generally be measured by the linear foot,
 in which case, stripes more than six inches in width will be converted to equivalent lengths
 of six-inch widths.

 necessary, to remove adhesive from exposed faces of pavement markers. No other solvent
 shall be used.
 All markers shall be installed in a uniform line, with controls established by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will establish controls for each line of markers by setting control points at
 not less than approximately 600-foot intervals on tangents and 50-foot intervals on curves.
 All additional work necessary to establish intermediate control points and individual
 marker points shall be performed by the Contractor, including smoothing out minor
 irregularities in any line established by the Engineer. On curves, the line of markers on
 lane lines and edge lines shall follow the normal curvature of the curve and placement on
 chords or other variations from the normal curvature will not be permitted, unless
 specifically shown on the plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 Reflective markers shall be installed in such a manner that the reflective face of the marker
 is perpendicular to a line parallel to the roadway centerline. No markers shall be installed
 over longitudinal or transverse joints of the pavement surface.
 The marker shall be protected against impact until the adhesive has hardened. The
 Engineer shall be the judge as to the minimum time necessary to cure the adhesive for
 sufficient set to bear traffic.
 The adhesive may be reheated and reused.
 temperatures shall not be exceeded.
 
 However, the pot life at application
 
 Clean-out of equipment and tanks may be performed using petroleum solvents such as
 diesel fuel or similar materials. CAUTION: Be sure that all heating is off before cleaning
 operations are begun. All solvent must be removed from the equipment tanks and lines
 before the next use of the melter.
 627.04--Method of Measurement. Raised pavement markers of the type specified will
 be measured per each as determined from actual count in place.

 to each anchor bolt.
 Install the base plate onto the leveling nut washers, place structural plate washers on
 top of the base plate; one (1) washer corresponding to each anchor bolt, and turn the
 top nuts onto the anchor bolts.
 Tighten top nuts to a “snug-tight” condition in a star pattern. Snug-tight is defined
 as the maximum nut rotation resulting from the full effort of one person on a 12inch long wrench or equivalent. A star tightening pattern is one in which the nuts
 on opposite or near opposite sides of the bolt circle are successively tightened in a
 pattern resembling a star.
 Tighten leveling nuts to a “snug-tight” condition in a star pattern. The distance from
 the bottom of the leveling nuts to the top of the concrete must not exceed one (1)
 anchor bolt diameter.
 Before final tightening of the top nuts, mark the reference position of each tip nut in
 a snug-tight condition with a suitable marking on one flat with a corresponding
 reference mark on the base plate at each bolt. Then incrementally turn the top nuts
 using a star pattern until achieving the required nut rotation specified in the
 following table. Turn the nuts in at least two (2) full tightening cycles (passes).
 After tightening, verify the nut rotation. Do not exceed the value specified in the
 following table by more than 20 degrees.

 Volume - The volume (count) of vehicles in each lane collected by the video detection
 system must be within five percent (±5%) of the manually counted volume for that lane.
 These levels of accuracy shall be provided during both day and night conditions. A
 minimum of 300 vehicles shall be used as a sample size for the entire field of view for

 the percent error will be calculated for the entire field of view.
 Stopped Vehicle Detection - The Vehicle Detection System shall be capable of detecting
 95% of all vehicles stopped on the shoulders or in lanes and triggering an alarm. Because
 of the possible dangers to motorists and workers during this test, the test will be completed

 shoulder in an active detection zone. An inspector or TMC operator will observe to verify
 
 605
 
 Section 643
 
 Section 643
 
 the detection of the stopped vehicle. This test will be performed on all of the video
 detection system installations up to five (5), or on a random sample of five (5) if the total
 number of Video Detection System installations is greater than this. If all parameters are
 met for all locations tested, all that are installed on the project will be considered
 acceptable. If one (1) or more locations fail, a second set of five (5) locations will be
 examined. If a failure in the second set is recorded, the Contractor will be required to take
 remedial action until a pass of five (5) locations is achieved.
 Speed - The system shall provide an average vehicle speed measurement within ±10% of
 actual speeds. These levels of accuracies shall be provided for traffic traveling between 20

 conditions. Personnel participating in and observing these tests will use either radar
 detectors or probe vehicles to conduct this accuracy demonstration. This test will be
 performed after the system is in operation as described in the stopped vehicle tests. Failure
 to achieve accuracy will require remedial/corrective action by the Contractor and repeated
 testing until accuracy is achieved.
 Other Parameters (Occupancy, Flow Rate, Headway, and Density) - If the measurements
 of speed and volume as described above fall within acceptable specified limits of accuracy,
 and the system is demonstrated to be able to provide the calculated values for these
 parameters, no further testing will be required. The formulas/algorithms used for the
 calculations by the system shall be provided to the Engineer as part of the documentation

 detection channel, in the event of unacceptable interference or loss of the sensor
 signal.
 The system shall be capable of automatically detecting a low-visibility condition
 such as fog and respond by placing all effected detection zones in a constant call
 mode. A user-selected alarm output shall be active during the low-visibility
 condition that can be used to modify the controller operation if connected to the
 appropriate controller input modifier(s). The system shall automatically revert to
 normal detection mode when the low-visibility condition no longer exists.
 Up to 24 detection zones per camera input shall be supported and each detection
 zone can be sized to suit the site and the desired vehicle detection region.
 The DP shall support two (2) independent trigger points for radar outputs for
 dilemma zone applications.
 The DP shall provide up to 24 open collector output channels per sensor input using
 one or more extension modules.
 A single detection zone shall be able to replace multiple inductive loops and the
 detection zones shall be OR'ed as the default or may be AND'ed together to indicate
 vehicle presence on a single approach of traffic movement.
 Placement of detection zones shall be done by using only a pointing device, and a
 graphical interface built into the DP and displayed on a video monitor or laptop
 computer to draw the detection zones on the video image from each video camera.
 When a vehicle is detected within a detection zone, a visual indication of the
 detection shall activate on the video overlay display to confirm the detection of the
 vehicle for the zone.
 Detection shall be at least 98% accurate in good weather conditions, with slight
 degradation possible under adverse weather conditions (e.g. rain, snow, or fog)
 which reduce visibility. Detection accuracy is dependent upon site geometry,
 camera placement, camera quality and detection zone location, and these accuracy
 levels do not include allowances for occlusion or poor video due to camera location
 or quality.
 The DP shall provide dynamic zone reconfiguration (DZR). DZR enables normal
 operation of existing detection zones when one zone is being added or modified
 during the setup process. The new zone configuration shall not go into effect until
 the configuration is saved by the operator.
 Detection zone setup shall not require site specific information such as latitude and
 longitude to be entered into the system.
 The DP shall process the video input from each camera at 30 frames per second.
 Multiple camera processors shall process all video inputs simultaneously.
 The DP shall output a constant call during the background learning period of no
 more than three (3) minutes.
 Detection zone outputs shall be configurable to allow the selection of presence,

 Section 643
 
 pulse, extend, and delay outputs. Timing parameters of pulse, extend, and delay
 outputs shall be user definable between 0.1 to 25.0 seconds.
 Up to six (6) video detection zones per sensor input shall have the capability to count
 the number of vehicles detected. The count value shall be internally stored for later
 retrieval through the communications port.
 In addition to the count type zone, the DP shall be able to calculate and/or acquire
 average speed and lane occupancy using both video and radar sensors. These values
 shall be stored in non-volatile memory for later retrieval.
 The DP shall have an “advance” zone type where detection outputs to the traffic
 controller are compensated for angular occlusion and distance.
 The user shall have the ability to enable or disable the display of the phase
 information on the video output.
 The DP shall have the capability to change the characteristics of a detection zone
 based on external inputs such as signal phase. Each detection zone shall be able to
 switch from one zone type (i.e. presence, extension, pulse, etc.) to another zone type
 based on the signal state. For example, a zone may be a “count” zone when the
 phase is green but change to a “presence” zone type when the phase is not green.
 Another application would be zone type of “extension” when the signal phase is
 green and then “delay” when red.
 The DP shall aid the user in drawing additional detection zones by automatically
 drawing and placing zones at appropriate locations with only a single click of the
 mouse. When the user wishes to modify the location of a zone, the DP shall allow
 the user move a single zone, multiple zones or all zones simultaneously.
 On screen zone identifiers shall be modifiable by the user. The user shall be allowed
 to select channel output assignments, zone type, input status, zone labels or zone
 numbers to be the identifier.
 For multiple camera input DPs, the user shall have the ability to enable automatic
 video output switching. The dwell time for each sensor input shall be user
 programmable.
 For the radar sensor zones the output can be triggered by presence of a vehicle only
 or by presence of a vehicle above a speed defined by the user.

 656.03.2.7--Burn-In Period. Following the Engineer’s written notice of successful
 completion of the CSAT, the entire newly installed system must operate successfully for a
 three (3) month burn-in period. During this burn-in period the Contractor shall be
 responsible for the full maintenance of the newly installed equipment. However, no
 separate payment will be made for the burn-in period activities and shall be included in the
 cost of other items. Successful completion of the burn-in period will occur at the end of
 three complete months of operation without a major system failure attributable to hardware,
 software or communications components. Each system failure during the burn-in period
 
 654
 
 Section 656
 
 Section 656
 
 will require an additional month of successful operation prior to being eligible for Final
 Acceptance. (i.e., if there are two system failures during the initial three month period, the
 burn-in period would be increased to five (5) months.)
 Burn-In General Requirements. Determination of a system failure shall be at the sole
 discretion of the Engineer. System failure is defined as a condition under which the system
 is unable to function as a whole or in significant part to provide the services as designed.
 While a single component failure will not constitute a system failure, chronic failure of that
 component or component type may be sufficient to be considered a system failure. Chronic
 failure of a component or component type is defined as 3 or more failures for the same
 component during the burn-in period.
 Components are defined as contract items or major material elements in a contract item.
 For electrical and electronic contract items, components are defined as the complete
 assembly of materials that makes up the contract item.
 Specifically exempted as system failures are failures caused by accident, acts of God, or
 other external forces that are beyond the control of the Contractor. However, failure of the
 contractor to respond to the repair request for that failure within 24 hours may be
 considered a system failure.
 The Department will advise the Contractor in writing when it considers that a system
 failure has occurred or chronic failure exists.
 If multiple system and/or chronic failures continue to occur throughout the burn-in period
 due to a single component type, the Contractor may be required to replace all units of that
 component type with a different model or manufacturer.
 The Contractor shall document all failures and subsequent diagnosis and repair. The repair
 documentation shall include as a minimum:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Description of the problem
 Troubleshooting and diagnosis steps
 Repairs made
 List of all equipment and materials changed including serial numbers.
 Update of the equipment inventory where needed.
 
 The Contractor shall provide the repair documentation to the Engineer within two (2) days
 of completing the repair; failure to provide acceptable documentation as required shall be
 reason to not approve the repair as complete. The Engineer will provide acceptance or
 rejection of the repair and documentation within seven (7) days.
 The Engineer reserves the right to require, at no additional expense to the State, the
 presence of a qualified technical representative of the equipment and/or software
 manufacturers as related to the diagnosis and/or repair of any system failure.
 During the burn-in period the Contractor shall perform incidental work such as touching
 up, cleaning of exposed surfaces, leveling and repair of sites, sodding/grassing and other
 maintenance work as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer to ensure the effectiveness
 and neat appearance of the work sites.
 
 655
 
 Section 656
 
 Section 656
 
 During the burn-in period the Engineer shall maintain a “burn-in period punch list” that
 contains required Contractor actions but that the Engineer does not define as a system
 failure. Each burn-in period punch list action item shall be completed by the Contractor to
 the Engineer’s satisfaction within seven (7) days of Contractor notification of the action
 item.
 During the burn-in period the Contractor is required to meet the following response times
 once notified there is a problem. A response is defined as being on-site to begin diagnosing
 the problem.
 
 
 
 Monday thru Friday: The Contractor shall respond no later than 9:00 a.m. the
 following morning after being notified.
 Weekends: If the Contractor is notified on Friday afternoon or during the weekend,
 the Contractor shall respond by 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
 
 During the burn-in period the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and
 replacement parts to completely maintain, troubleshoot and repair all items installed under
 this contract. No separate payment will be made for any labor, materials, equipment, or
 replacement parts needed during the burn-in period.
 The overall burn-in period will be considered complete upon the successful completion of
 the burn-in time periods, the Engineer’s acceptance of all repairs and repair documentation,
 completion of all burn-in period punch list actions and a final inspection as described
 below.
 656.03.2.8--DMS Final Inspection. Upon successful completion of the burn-in period,
 the project shall be eligible for the DMS final inspection. The DMS final inspection will
 be conducted provided the burn-in period has demonstrated the entire system is operating
 successfully. The DMS final inspection shall include but is not limited to;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 monitoring of all system functions at the TMC to demonstrate the overall system is
 operational
 a field visit to each site to ensure all field components are in their correct final
 configuration
 verification that all burn-in punch list items have been completed
 verification that all final cleanup requirements have been completed
 approval of final as-built documentation
 
 Prior to conducting the DMS final inspection, the burn-in period shall demonstrate that all
 requirements defined in the specifications have been met.
 The Contractor shall request in writing the Engineer’s approval to start the DMS final
 inspection a minimum of 14 days prior to the requested start date. The Engineer reserves
 the right to reschedule the start date if needed. The start date for the DMS final inspection
 cannot be prior to the successful completion of the overall burn-in period.
 An unsuccessful or incomplete DMS final inspection shall require a new DMS final
 inspection after the Contractor has made the necessary corrections. Up to 14 days shall be
 allowed for the Engineer to conduct a DMS final inspection.

 Material requiring specified tests used by a plant for producing composite material(s) or
 product(s) to be used in the work will be tested and approved by the Engineer. If such
 materials, composite materials, or products are stored separately for the exclusive use in
 the work, the cost of testing will be borne by the Department. If such materials, composite
 materials or products are not stored separately for the exclusive use in the work, the cost
 of testing shall be borne as set out in the Department's issued SOP in effect at the time bids
 are received.
 700.04--Determination of Conformity. The determination of conformity with each
 required measurable characteristic under the intent of Subsection l05.03 will be made in
 accordance with the following:
 All test values or test results used to determine compliance will be rounded off to the
 nearest decimal point as expressed in the specifications for the particular characteristic
 under consideration. Fractions beyond the point of rounding amounting to less than 0.50
 will be dropped. Similar fractions amounting to more than 0.50 will be rounded off by
 increasing the last digit within the rounding. Similar fractions amounting to even 0.50 will
 be rounded toward the specifications by dropping or by increasing the last digit within the
 rounding, as applicable.
 The various frames of materials or work will be divided into lots as specified in the contract
 or conforming to the Department's SOP for frequency of sampling and testing.
 In the case of borderline quality products or a demonstrated trend toward borderline quality
 products, the Engineer will require the Contractor to improve the quality of the materials
 or work to more nearly conform to the specifications and may require a suspension of the
 operations that have resulted in the borderline product or the trend toward borderline
 quality until such corrective measures have been taken as deemed necessary to produce the
 contemplated quality products.
 All increments of tests for determination of acceptance will be taken by random sampling.
 However, during or as a result of visual inspection, the Engineer will take increments for
 testing for progress checks or spot checks at any time and place the Engineer may deem
 necessary to determine weak spots or other progress information. The results of any such
 progress or spot checks may be used to determine whether or not additional work or
 corrective action is considered necessary prior to acceptance testing.
 Minimum and maximum requirements in these specifications are set out on the basis that
 the desirable average test value of the materials or work is appreciably above the minimum
 requirement or appreciably below the maximum requirement established.
 700.05--Material Certifications and Certified Test Reports. All certifications and

 SECTION 703 - AGGREGATES
 703.01--General. All aggregate sources shall be approved by the Department prior to use.
 All approved aggregate sources will be re-examined periodically for conformance to the
 quality requirements set herein.
 The term "thin or elongated piece" is intended to mean a piece whose length is more than
 five times its average thickness. Suspected pieces will be chosen from a representative
 sample, and the length and average thickness will be determined visually.
 The term "fractured face" is intended to mean that the approximate area of a fractured face
 shall not be less than the approximate cross-sectional area at the minor axis of the particle.
 This area will be visually determined. A piece of aggregate with a small chipped area will
 not be considered as crushed.

 construction of culverts, headwalls, retaining walls, steps, or other minor structures shall
 consist of natural sand or manufactured limestone sand. Fine aggregate used in major
 construction, such as concrete pavements and bridges, shall be natural sand unless
 otherwise designated on the plans or in any special provisions. Natural sand, or
 manufactured limestone sand, shall be composed of clean, hard, durable, and uncoated
 particles free of deleterious substances and organic impurities. Fine aggregate from more
 than one source shall not be used alternately, or mixed, without the written consent of the
 Engineer. Fine aggregates will be added to the APL based on new source approval testing
 by the Department. Source approval of fine aggregate sources will be based on the
 following:
 (a) Soundness of aggregate shall meet the requirements set out in Subsection
 703.02.2.3.
 (b) Expansion of mortar bars shall not exceed 0.10% in 16 days when tested in

 720.03.7.8--Test Procedure for Flexibility. The following procedures shall be followed
 for flexibility.
 Sample Preparation - One-eighth inch thick steel shims are used to enclose an opening that
 is one-inch wide and four-inches long on a sheet of release paper or a release treated metal
 plate. The heated adhesive is poured into the opening until it is slightly overfilled. After
 one hour of cooling the excess adhesive is trimmed flush with the shims using a hot knife
 and then the sample is removed from the shims.
 Conditioning - The trimmed samples are placed in a freezer maintained at 20 ±2°F for a
 minimum of four hours.
 Testing - The conditioned samples are removed from the freezer and immediately bent over
 a one-inch diameter mandrel through an arc of 90 degrees in 10 seconds at a uniform rate
 of nine degrees per second. A passing result is one in which no cracking occurs in the test
 sample. At least two of the three specimens tested must meet the flexibility requirement at
 20°F for a passing result.

 TESTING PROCEDURE FOR
 REFRACTIVE INDEX OF BEADS BY LIQUID IMMERSION
 EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
 a. Microscope, minimum 100X magnification
 b. Light Source - preferably sodium light or other monochromatic source, but not
 absolutely essential
 c. Refractive Index Liquids*
 d. Microscope Slide and Slide Cover
 e. Mortar and Pestle
 * Available from R.P. Cargille Laboratories, Inc., Cedar Grove, NJ
 PROCEDURE:
 a) Using the mortar and pestle, crush a few representative beads and place a few of
 these crushed particles on a microscope slide.
 b) Place a drop of a refractive index liquid, with an index as close to that of the glass
 as can be estimated, on the crushed bead particles.
 c) Cover the slide with a microscope slide cover and view the crushed particles by
 transmitted light normal to the slide surface by illumination from the bottom.
 d) Adjust the microscope mirror to allow a minimum light intensity for viewing.
 This is important when sodium light is not used.
 e) Bring a relatively flat and transparent particle into focus.
 f) By slightly raising and lowering the microscope tube, look for one or both of the
 following:
 1. Becke Line - This light line will appear to move either into the particle or
 away from it. In general, when the microscope tube is raised, the line will
 move toward the material of higher refractive index. When the microscope
 tube is lowered, the line will move toward the material of lower index.
 2. Variation in Particle Brightness - When raising the microscope tube from
 sharp focus, the particle will appear to get brighter or darker than the
 
 852
 
 Section 720
 
 Section 720
 
 surrounding field. If it becomes brighter, the glass has a higher refractive
 index than the liquid. If it becomes darker, the glass has a lower refractive
 index than the liquid. In both cases, the opposite will be true when the
 microscope tube is lowered.
 g) This test can be used to confirm that the beads are above or below a specified
 index. It can also be used to give an accurate determination of the index, ±0.001.
 This is done by using several refractive index liquids until a match or near match
 of indices occurs. The index of the glass will equal that of the liquid when no
 Becke line and no variation in bead brightness can be observed.
 720.07.3.3.2--Acid Resistance. The beads shall show resistance to corrosion of their
 surface after exposure to a 1% solution by weight of sulfuric acid. The 1% acid solution
 shall be made by adding 5.7 mL of concentrated acid into 1000 mL of distilled water.
 CAUTION: Always add the concentrated acid into the water, not the reverse. The test
 shall be performed as follows:
 Take a 1" x 2" sample, adhere it to the bottom of a glass tray and place just enough acid
 solution to completely immerse the sample. Cover the tray with a piece of glass to prevent
 evaporation and allow the sample to be exposed for 24 hours under these conditions. Then
 decant the acid solution, but do not rinse, touch, or otherwise disturb the bead surfaces, and
 dry the sample while adhered to the glass tray in a 150°F oven for approximately 15
 minutes.
 Microscopic examination at 20X shall show no more than 15% of the beads having a
 formation of a very distinct opaque white, corroded, layer on their entire surface.
 720.07.3.4--Color. The preformed pavement markings shall consist of white and yellow
 films with pigments selected and blended to conform to standard highway colors.
 720.07.3.5--Skid Resistance. The patterned surface of the retroreflective pliant polymer
 shall provide an initial average skid resistance value of 45 BPN when tested according to
 ASTM E 303, except values will be taken at downweb and at a 45 degree angle from
 downweb. These two values will then be averaged to find the skid resistance of the
 patterned surface.
 720.07.3.6--Patchability. The pavement marking material shall be capable of use for
 patching worn areas of the same type in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
 720.07.3.7--Thickness. The patterned material, without adhesive, shall have a minimum
 caliper of 0.065 inch at the thickest portion of the patterned cross-section and a minimum
 caliper of 0.020 inch at the thinnest portion of the cross-section.
 720.07.4--Effective Performance Life. The film, when applied according to the
 recommendations of the manufacturer, shall provide a neat, durable marking that will not
 flow or distort due to temperature if the pavement surface remains stable. The film shall
 be weather resistant and, through normal traffic wear, shall show no appreciable fading,
 lifting or shrinkage throughout the useful life of the marking, and shall show no significant
 tearing, roll back, or other signs of poor adhesion.
 720.07.5--Manufacturer’s Certification. The Contractor shall furnish the Engineer three
 copies of the manufacturer's certification stating that each lot in a shipment complies with
 
 853
 
 Section 720
 
 Section 720
 
 the requirements of the contract.

 on results of tests performed by the Department on verification samples submitted from
 each lot shipped to the project. The Engineer will select one sample at random from each
 lot in the shipment for testing. A sample extending full width of the randomly selected
 sample and five linear feet in length will be obtained and submitted by the Engineer. The
 sample from each shipment shall be provided at no cost to the State.

 801.01--Description. Foundation excavation shall include the removal of all material, of
 whatever nature, necessary for the construction of foundations and substructures of
 structures in accordance with the plans or as directed by the Engineer. When shown as a
 pay item, it shall include the furnishing of all necessary equipment and the construction of
 all cribs, cofferdams, dewatering, etc. necessary for execution of the work. It shall also
 include the subsequent removal of cofferdams and cribs and the placement of all necessary
 backfill as hereinafter specified. It shall also include the disposal of excavated material
 that is not required for backfill or other specified usage, in a manner and in locations that
 will not affect the carrying capacity of the channel or other drainage or be unsightly.
 Unless a greater area is necessary for construction, the bridge site shall be the area defined
 in Subsection 101.02. Clearing and grubbing shall be in accordance with the provisions of
 Subsection 201.04.
 All substructures, where practicable, shall be constructed in open excavation, and where
 necessary, the excavation shall be shored, braced, or protected by cofferdams in accordance
 with approved methods. When footings can be placed in the dry without the use of cribs
 or cofferdams, backforms may be omitted with the approval of the Engineer and the entire
 excavation filled with concrete to the top of the footing. The additional concrete required
 shall be placed at the expense of the Contractor.
 801.02--Materials. Unless designated otherwise, all material used for backfill shall meet
 the requirements of Subsection 203.03.8.6.
 801.03--Construction Requirements.
 801.03.1--Preservation of Channel. Unless otherwise specified, no excavation shall be
 made outside of cribs, cofferdams, or sheet piling, and the natural stream bed adjacent to
 the structure shall not be disturbed without permission of the Engineer. If any excavation
 or dredging is made at the site of the structure before cribs or cofferdams are in place, the
 Contractor shall, without extra compensation and after the foundation base is in place,
 backfill all such excavation to the original ground surface or river bed with material
 satisfactory to the Engineer. Material deposited within the stream area from foundation or
 other excavation or from the filling of cofferdams shall be removed and the stream area
 freed from obstruction thereby.
 801.03.2--Depth of Footings. The elevations shown on the plans for bottoms of footings
 shall be considered as approximate, and the Engineer may order in writing changes in
 dimensions or elevations necessary for a satisfactory foundation.
 801.03.3--Preparation of Foundations for Footings. All rock or other hard foundation
 material shall be cut to a firm surface, either level, stepped, or roughened as may be directed
 by the Engineer, and then cleaned of all loose material. All seams shall be cleaned out and
 filled with concrete, mortar, or grout.
 
 895
 
 Section 801
 
 Section 801
 
 When masonry is to rest on an excavated surface other than rock, special care shall be taken
 not to disturb the bottom of the excavation, and the final removal of the foundation material
 to grade shall not be made until just before the masonry is to be placed.
 Excavation and preparation of foundations for footings for box bridges shall be in
 accordance with the provisions of Section 206.
 801.03.4--Cofferdams and Cribs.
 801.03.4.1--General. Cofferdams and cribs shall be safely designed and constructed to
 adequate depths and heights, and be made as water-tight as is necessary for the proper
 performance of the work to be done inside them. In general, the interior dimensions of
 cofferdams and cribs shall be sufficient to permit construction of forms and the inspection
 of their exteriors and to permit pumping outside of the forms. Cofferdams or cribs which
 tilt or move laterally during the process of sinking shall be righted, reset, or enlarged so as
 to provide the necessary clearance. All corrective work shall be at the expense of the
 Contractor.
 When conditions are encountered that, in the opinion of the Engineer, make it impracticable
 to dewater the foundation, the Engineer may require the construction of a concrete seal of
 the dimensions necessary. The foundation shall then be pumped out and the balance of the
 masonry placed in the dry. When weighted cribs are employed, and the weight is utilized
 to partially overcome the hydrostatic pressure acting against the bottom of the foundation
 seal, special anchorage such as dowels or keys shall be provided to transfer the entire
 weight of the crib into the foundation seal. During the placing of a foundation seal, the
 water elevation inside the cofferdam shall be controlled to prevent any flow through the
 seal, and if the cofferdam is to remain in place, it shall be vented or ported at low water
 level.
 801.03.4.2--Protection of Concrete. Cofferdams or cribs shall be constructed so as to
 protect green concrete against damage from a sudden rising of the stream and to prevent
 damage to the foundation by erosion. Timber or bracing that will extend into the
 substructure masonry shall not be left in cofferdams without written permission from the
 Engineer.
 801.03.4.3--Drawings Required. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer four copies
 of structural design analysis and detail drawings that show the proposed method of
 constructing the cofferdam. These drawings shall include the types and sizes of sheeting,
 wales, bracing, and struts, the connections therefore, and the proposed method of installing,
 sealing, dewatering, cut-off and/or removal. The cofferdam analysis and details shall be
 prepared by and bear the seal of a Registered Professional Engineer experienced in
 cofferdam design.
 The Registered Professional Engineer shall certify that the actual material and material
 fabrication used for cofferdam construction are capable of supporting the loads.
 When submitting drawings and design analysis, the Contractor shall list the bent numbers
 on which the construction of cofferdams is proposed.

 and bracing shall be removed after the completion of the substructure. Care shall be taken
 not to disturb or otherwise injure the finished masonry.
 801.03.5--Pumping. Pumping from the interior of a foundation enclosure shall be done so
 as to preclude the possibility of movement of water through fresh concrete. There shall be
 no pumping during the placing of concrete or for a period of at least 24 hours thereafter,
 unless it can be done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete work by a watertight wall or other effective means.
 Pumping to dewater a sealed cofferdam shall not commence until the seal has set
 sufficiently to withstand the hydrostatic pressure.
 801.03.6--Inspection. After each excavation is completed, the Contractor shall notify the
 Engineer, and no masonry shall be placed until the Engineer has approved the depth of the
 excavation and the character of the foundation material.
 801.03.7--Backfill. Backfill of solid structures may commence upon removal of forms.
 Backfill of wall structures shall be in accordance with Subsection 601.03.6.3.

 surface of the surrounding ground or to the typical section indicated on the plans. All
 backfill shall be thoroughly compacted and sufficient allowance shall be made for
 settlement.
 Where it provides drainage, bearing strength, or lateral support to the permanent
 construction, all backfilling shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of
 Subsection 203.03.8.6. In general, the top surface of backfilled area shall be neatly graded
 to the section indicated on the plans or established.
 801.03.8--Approach Embankment. When approach embankments are required, they
 shall be constructed and will be paid for in accordance with Section 203.
 801.04--Method of Measurement. Foundation excavation, satisfactorily performed, will
 be measured by the cubic yard in the original position with dimensions determined as
 follows:
 (a) Bottom - the elevation of the bottom of the footing, seal, or web wall as
 applicable.
 (b) Top - the elevation of the original ground or graded section, whichever is lower.
 (c) Sides - vertical planes no more than 18 inches outside the outer edges shown
 on the plans, or directed, for the footing, seal and web wall.
 The measurement will not include water or other liquids, but will include mud, muck, and

 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 A different pile driving system, modifications to the existing system, or different pile
 installation procedures shall be proposed by the Contractor if the pile installation stresses
 predicted by the wave equation analysis or calculated by the Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA)
 are not within the AASHTO values. All approvals are conditional and subject to trial and
 satisfactory performance in the field. Unless otherwise permitted by the Bridge Engineer
 in writing, test piles and permanent piles shall be driven with the approved driving system.
 803.03.1.7.3--Pile Hammers. Piles may be driven with an approved single-acting or
 double-acting pile hammer in combination with water jets or pre-formed pile holes. The
 pile driving system shall be constructed so as to afford freedom of movement of the pile
 hammer and to drive the piles to the required depth within the tolerances specified without
 undue injury to the piles.
 The pile hammer shall be in good working condition and produce the energy required to
 install piles to the depth or penetration required in the plans. Single or double-acting
 Steam/Air, Diesel/Internal Combustion, or Hydraulic hammers may be submitted for
 review and approval.
 In no case shall a gravity or drop hammer be used to drive concrete or steel piles supporting
 the permanent bridge structure. A drop hammer may be used to install timber or steel piles
 for temporary construction, but in no case shall a gravity or drop hammer be used to drive
 concrete piles.
 803.03.1.7.3.1--Pipe Pile Hammers.
 803.03.1.7.3.1.1--Impact Hammers. Piles may be driven with an approved single-acting
 or double-acting pile hammer, as recommended on the plans, in combination with water
 jets or pre-formed pile holes. The pile driving system shall be constructed so as to afford
 freedom of movement of the pile hammer and to drive the piles to the required depth within
 the tolerances specified without undue injury to the piles.
 The pile hammer shall be in good working condition and produce the energy required to
 install piles to the depth or penetration required in the plans. Single or double-acting
 Steam/Air, Diesel/Internal Combustion, or Hydraulic hammers may be submitted for
 review and approval.
 In no case shall a gravity or drop hammer be used to drive concrete or steel piles supporting
 the permanent bridge structure. A drop hammer may be used to install timber or steel piles
 for temporary construction, but in no case shall a gravity or drop hammer be used to drive
 concrete piles.
 803.03.1.7.3.1.2--Vibratory Hammers. Vibratory hammers in good working condition
 may be used to advance steel pipe piles to within twenty feet (20’) of minimum tip elevation
 of production pile for PDA Test Piles and five feet (5’) of minimum pile tip elevation for
 permanent piles. Vibratory hammers shall be attached centrally to the pile head. Under
 no circumstances can vibratory hammers be used to advance steel pipe piles for the last
 five feet (5’) of pile length. The Contractor may have the option to use a vibratory hammer
 to drive the steel pipe pile within five feet (5’) of minimum pile tip elevation for permanent
 piles.

 dimensions of the pile cushion shall be included in the appropriate place on the Pile and
 Driving Equipment Data Form.
 803.03.1.7.4.3--Water Jets. Water jets may be used in conjunction with the pile hammer
 to install piles to the required depth or penetration called for in the plans. The use of water
 jets, where the stability of embankments or other improvements would be endangered, will
 not be permitted. When water jets are used, the number of jets and the volume and pressure
 of water shall be sufficient to adequately facilitate driving without undue damage to the
 pile or the soil adjacent to or below the pile. Unless otherwise specified, water jets shall
 not be used within five feet of the final tip elevation of the pile. In addition, it shall be the
 Contractor’s responsibility to withdraw the water jets sufficiently above the five foot
 requirement to obtain the specified bearing at the required cut off elevation.
 In the event a jetted pile fails to obtain the specified bearing at the required penetration and
 a determination is made by the Engineer that the Contractor has failed to properly control
 the jetting operation, the Contractor should submit detailed corrective measures for
 founding the pile to the Engineer for approval. Any required corrective measures to the
 pile due to the Contractor’s operation shall be performed at no additional cost to the State.
 803.03.1.7.4.4--Followers. Followers are considered to be part of the Driving System and
 should be included for approval with the Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form. Included

 depth of each hole required or permitted.
 If it is determined from the Geotechnical Investigation or from the site survey that preformed pile holes are necessary, a pay item and estimated quantities will be included on
 the plans, and the Bridge Engineer will furnish the Contractor with an itemized list showing
 the location, size and bottom elevation of each hole.
 If the plans do not specify pre-formed pile holes and the Bridge Engineer, with the
 concurrence of the Construction Engineer, determines during construction that subsurface
 conditions are encountered that necessitate pre-formed pile holes, at certain locations, an
 
 904
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 adjustment in the contract unit price for furnishing and driving piling at these locations
 may be made under the provisions of Subsection 104.02.
 If in the judgment of the Engineer pre-formed pile holes are not required and the Contractor
 desires to use them, the Contractor may be permitted to do so under conditions prescribed
 by the Bridge Engineer and at no additional cost to the State.
 For pipe piling, the indicator pile and the first production steel pipe test pile shall be driven
 without a pre-formed hole. Based on the results, the Director of Structures, State Bridge
 Engineer, will make all determinations as to the necessity for pre-formed holes on all
 subsequent steel pipe test piles and steel pipe production piles. If it is determined that
 preformed holes are necessary, the Director of Structures, State Bridge Engineer, will
 furnish the Contractor with an itemized list showing the location, size, and bottom elevation
 of each hole.
 If in the judgment of the Director of Structures, State Bridge Engineer, pre-formed holes
 for pipe piling are not required and the Contractor desires to use them, the Contractor may
 be permitted to do so under conditions prescribed by the Director of Structures, State
 Bridge Engineer, and at no additional cost to the State.
 803.03.1.7.4.6--Additional Equipment. When a minimum penetration is indicated on the
 plans and is not obtained by the use of an approved hammer, the Contractor shall submit
 to the Engineer for approval a completed Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form for a
 heavier hammer or resort to jetting at no additional cost to the State.
 803.03.1.8--Defective Piles. Prior to driving, piles shall not be subjected to handling that
 causes damage either through bending, crushing or spalling of concrete, or deformation of
 the steel. All piles damaged because of internal defects or by improper driving, driven out
 of the proper location or driven below the specified elevation shall be corrected at the
 Contractor’s expense by one of the following methods approved by the Engineer for the
 pile in question:
 (a) The pile shall be withdrawn and replaced by a new and, if necessary, a longer
 pile.
 (b) A second pile shall be driven adjacent to the defective or low pile.
 (c) The pile shall be spliced or built up or a sufficient portion of the footing shall be
 extended to properly embed the pile. All piles pushed up by the driving of
 adjacent piles or by any other cause shall be driven down to grade.
 803.03.1.9--Determination of Bearing Value of Piling.
 803.03.1.9.1--General. The ability of the pile to transfer load to the ground will be
 determined to the satisfaction of the Bridge Engineer. Such determination will be made by
 the Department’s Geotechnical Engineer and Foundation Engineer from a subsurface
 investigation conducted by the Department’s Geotechnical Branch of Materials Division
 and test piles that are driven out-of-position or driven to be incorporated in the structure as
 permanent piles.

 the Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent damage to such structures.
 This shall include newly constructed bridge components. If not otherwise provided for in
 the plans, the Contractor shall be solely responsible for taking measures to prevent damage
 to existing structures resulting from pile driving operations. These measures shall include,
 but are not limited to, monitoring and controlling the vibrations resulting from pile driving
 activities. Driving of piling within 30 feet of recently placed concrete will not be permitted
 unless the concrete in that structure has attained a compressive strength of 2500 psi, as
 determined by cylinder tests, or maturity meter probe when maturity meter readings
 indicate that the required concrete strength is achieved. Test samples shall be prepared and
 tested by the Department from material representative of the recently constructed structure

 The Engineer will evaluate the evidence of qualifications submitted for conformance with
 these specifications. Should the information submitted be incomplete or not conform to
 
 911
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 the project specifications, the information will be rejected and the Contractor shall submit
 changes for reevaluation.
 If the Contractor wishes to replace the drilled shaft superintendent or the driller during the
 life of the project, the name and experience record of the replacement superintendent or
 driller shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval.
 803.03.2.1.2--Drilled Shaft Installation Plan. At the Preconstruction Conference, or no
 later than 45 calendar days before drilled shaft construction begins, the Contractor shall
 submit to the Engineer an installation plan for review. This plan shall provide information
 on the following:
 (a) A copy of the proposed drilled shaft concrete mix design as submitted with the

 The Engineer will evaluate the Contractor’s Drilled Shaft Installation Plan for
 conformance with the plans and specifications, after which the Engineer will notify the
 Contractor within 14 calendar days of any additional information and/or changes that may
 be required. Any part of the plan that is unacceptable will be rejected and the Contractor
 shall submit changes for reevaluation.
 All approvals given by the Engineer shall be subject to trial and satisfactory field
 performance, and shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to satisfactorily
 complete the work as detailed on the plans and in the specifications.

 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 803.03.2.2--Trial Shaft Construction. The Contractor shall demonstrate the adequacy of
 the methods and equipment during construction of an out of position trial shaft. This trial
 shaft shall be positioned as far as practical from the production shafts, in the position shown
 on the plans or as directed by the Engineer, and shall be drilled to the minimum tip elevation
 as required on the plans. When shown on the plans, the reaming of bells at specified trial
 shafts will be required to establish the feasibility of belling in a specific soil strata. Failure
 to demonstrate the adequacy of the Contractor's methods and equipment to construct the
 trial shaft shall be cause for the Engineer to require alterations in equipment and/or method
 by the Contractor, to eliminate unsatisfactory results. Backfilling of unsuccessful
 excavations and any additional trial shafts required to demonstrate the adequacy of altered
 methods of construction or equipment shall be performed by the Contractor at no additional
 cost to the State. Once the Contractor has completed the excavation for the trial shaft to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Contractor shall set the reinforcement and pour the
 concrete to finish construction of the trial shaft. This shall be demonstration that the entire
 plan for drilled shaft construction is satisfactory. Failure to successfully construct the trial
 shaft shall be cause for rejection of the trial shaft, and shall be reason for the Engineer to
 require alterations necessary to eliminate unsatisfactory results. Additional trial shafts
 necessary to demonstrate correction of deficiencies shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 If differing soil conditions require two (2) or more methods for construction of production
 shafts, said methods shall be demonstrated by trial shaft prior to construction of any
 production shaft.
 After the successful trial shaft has been completed, the Contractor shall submit in writing
 for review the successful methods and equipment used. This submittal, once reviewed,
 will serve as the approved method of construction for all the production shafts covered by
 that successful trial shaft. Once approval has been given to construct production shafts, no
 changes will be permitted in the methods, equipment, drilled shaft superintendent, or driller
 from those used during the construction of the trial shaft without written approval of the
 Engineer.
 Trial shafts shall be cut off two (2) feet below finish grade or two (2) feet below the mud
 line and left in place. The portions of the shafts cut off and removed shall remain the
 property of the Contractor. The disturbed areas in the vicinity of the trial shaft shall be
 restored as nearly as practical to their original condition.
 803.03.2.3--Construction Methods and Equipment.
 803.03.2.3.1--General.
 803.03.2.3.1.1--Protection of Existing Structures. When the plans require drilled shaft
 excavations within close proximity to existing structures or utilities, the Contractor shall
 take all reasonable precautions to prevent damage to such structures. This shall include
 newly constructed shafts. If not otherwise provided for in the plans, the Contractor shall
 be solely responsible for evaluating the need for, design of, and providing all reasonable
 precautionary features to prevent damage. These measures shall include, but are not
 limited to, selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent caving of the
 shaft excavation, and monitoring and controlling the vibrations from construction
 activities, including the driving of casings, driving of sheeting, or from blasting, when
 permitted. Advancing an uncased drilled shaft excavation or the use of a vibratory hammer
 
 913
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 to install casings within three times the diameter of a newly constructed shaft will not be
 permitted unless the concrete in that shaft has attained a compressive strength of 2500 psi,
 as determined by cylinder tests, or maturity meter probe when maturity meter readings
 indicate that the required concrete strength is achieved. Test samples shall be prepared and
 tested by the Department from material representative of the upper mass of the newly
 constructed shaft and cured in conditions similar to the drilled shaft. Based upon
 observations, the Engineer may adjust this distance accordingly. During shaft construction,
 the Contractor shall take into account and make provisions for vibrations caused by
 activities other than the Contractor’s, such as adjacent traffic.
 If a maturity meter probe is used, it shall be located in the upper portion of the drilled shaft
 concrete. Procedures for using the maturity meter and developing the strength/maturity
 relationship shall follow the requirements of AASHTO T 325 and ASTM C 1074
 specifications. Technicians using the maturity meter or calculating strength/maturity
 graphs shall be required to have at least two hours of training prior to using the maturity
 equipment. The training shall be approved by the Department.
 Such structures shall be monitored for settlement in an approved manner, recording
 elevations to 0.01 foot. The number and location of monitoring points shall be as approved
 by the Engineer. Elevations shall be taken before construction begins, during the driving
 of any required casings, and during excavation as directed by the Engineer.
 When shown on the plans, or as directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall monitor and
 record vibration levels during the driving of casings, sheeting, or during blasting
 operations. Vibration monitoring equipment shall be capable of detecting particle
 velocities of 0.1 inch/second or less.
 At any time the Contractor detects settlement of 0.03 foot, vibration levels reaching 1.5
 inches per second, or damage to the structure, the Contractor shall immediately stop the
 source of vibrations, backfill the excavation, and contact the Engineer for instructions.
 803.03.2.3.1.2--Construction Sequence for Site Preparation. Excavation to the plan
 footing elevation, if required, shall be completed before shaft construction begins. Any
 disturbance to the footing area caused by shaft installation shall be repaired by the
 Contractor prior to the footing pour.
 When drilled shafts are to be installed in conjunction with embankment placement, the
 Contractor shall construct the drilled shafts after placement of the embankment material.
 803.03.2.3.1.3--General Methods and Equipment. The Contractor shall perform the
 excavations required for the shafts and bell footings, through whatever materials
 encountered to the dimensions and elevations shown on the plans, or otherwise required by
 the specifications, at no additional cost to the State. The Contractor's methods and
 equipment shall be suited for the intended purpose and the materials encountered.
 Drilled shafts shall be constructed by the dry method, wet method, casing method, or
 permanent casing method, as necessary to produce a sound, durable, concrete foundation
 free of defects. The permanent casing method shall be used only when required by the
 plans or authorized by the Engineer. When the plans describe a particular method of
 construction, this method shall be used unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer. The
 Engineer may permit an alternate method than designated on the plans, only after
 
 914
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 successful construction of an out of position trial shaft. When the plans do not describe a
 particular method, the Contractor shall utilize a method on the basis of its suitability to the
 site conditions. Blasting shall only be permitted if specifically stated on the plans or
 approved by the Engineer.
 Once approval is given to construct production shafts, no changes will be permitted in the
 methods or equipment from those used in constructing the accepted trial shaft without
 written approval of the Engineer.
 803.03.2.3.2--Dry Construction Method. The dry construction method shall be used only
 at sites where the groundwater level and soil conditions are suitable to permit construction
 of the shaft in a relatively dry excavation, and where the sides and bottom of the shaft may
 be visually inspected by the Engineer prior to placing the concrete. The dry method
 consists of drilling the shaft excavation, placing the reinforcing cage, and concreting the
 shaft in a relatively dry excavation.
 The dry construction method shall be used only when the trial shaft excavation
 demonstrates that: concrete can be placed with less than three (3) inches of accumulated
 water in the bottom of the shaft; the sides and bottom of the hole remain stable without
 caving, sloughing, or swelling over a two-hour period immediately following completion
 of the excavation; and any loose material and excess water can be satisfactorily removed
 prior to inspection and prior to concrete placement.
 803.03.2.3.3--Wet Construction Method. The wet construction method shall be used at
 all sites where it is impractical to provide a dry excavation for placement of the shaft
 concrete.
 The wet construction method consists of drilling the shaft excavation below the water table,
 keeping the shaft filled with water or mineral slurry, desanding or cleaning the slurry, final
 cleaning of the excavation by means of a bailing bucket, air lift, submersible pump or other
 approved devices, and placing the rebar cage and the shaft concrete, with a tremie or
 concrete pump beginning at the shaft bottom, which displaces the water or slurry as the
 shaft is concreted. Temporary surface casings shall be provided to aid shaft alignment and
 position and to prevent sloughing of the top of the shaft, except when the Contractor
 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the surface casing is not required.
 Where drilled shafts are located in open water areas, the shafts shall be constructed by the
 wet method using casings extending from above the water elevation into the ground to
 protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete.
 The casing shall be installed in a manner that will produce a positive seal at the bottom of
 the casing so that there is no intrusion or extrusion of water or other materials into or from
 the shaft excavation. Casings for this application may include multiple casings, temporary
 casings, and/or designed permanent casings.
 The wet construction method may be used in combination with the dry method and
 temporary or permanent casing methods.
 803.03.2.3.4--Casing Construction Method. The casing construction method may be
 used at sites when the dry or wet construction methods are inadequate to prevent hole
 caving or excessive deformation of the hole. In this method, the casing may be either
 
 915
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 placed in a predrilled hole if no caving, swelling, or yielding occurs, or advanced through
 the ground by twisting, driving, or vibration before being cleaned out.
 When a formation is reached that is nearly impervious, a casing shall be placed in the hole
 and seated in the nearly impervious formation. Drilling may proceed as with the dry
 method to the projected depth. If seepage occurs at this point, temporary casing may be
 advanced further to create the dry condition. In the event seepage conditions prevent use
 of the dry method, excavation shall be completed using wet methods. The placement of
 the concrete shall proceed as with the wet or dry method, except that the casing shall be
 withdrawn after the concrete is placed.
 When caving soils occur near the ground surface and/or if the top of the concrete for the
 drilled shaft is below the ground surface, the Contractor shall set a suitable temporary
 removable surface casing. The minimum surface casing length shall be the length required
 to prevent caving of the surface soils and to aid in maintaining shaft position and alignment.
 Predrilling with slurry and/or overreaming to the outside diameter of the casing may be
 acceptable if required to install the surface casing at some sites.
 Where drilling is through materials having a tendency to cave, the drilling shall be
 advanced by drilling in a mineral slurry. In the event that a caving layer or layers are
 encountered that cannot be controlled by slurry, the Contractor shall install temporary
 removable casing through such caving layer or layers. Overreaming to the outside diameter
 of the casing may be required. However, the final dimensions of the drilled shaft shall not
 be altered to accommodate these construction practices unless approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall take whatever steps that are required to prevent caving during shaft
 excavation including installation of deeper casings. If the Contractor elects to remove a
 casing and replace it with a longer casing through caving soils, the Contractor shall
 adequately stabilize the excavation with slurry or backfill the excavation. Other approved
 methods that will control the size of the excavation and protect the integrity of the
 foundation soils may be used to excavate through caving layers.
 803.03.2.3.5--Permanent Casing Method. The permanent casing method shall be used
 when required by the plans. In this method, a casing is driven to the prescribed depth
 before excavation begins. If full penetration cannot be attained, the Contractor may
 excavate material from inside the casing and the casing may be driven again until reaching
 the desired penetration. In some cases overreaming to the outside diameter of the casing
 may be required before driving the casing.
 The casing shall be cut off at the prescribed elevation upon reaching the proper construction
 sequence, and the remainder of the casing is left in place.
 803.03.2.3.6--Excavation and Drilling Equipment. The excavation and drilling
 equipment shall have adequate capacity including power, torque, and down thrust to
 excavate a hole of both the maximum diameter and to a depth 20 percent greater than the
 longest shaft shown on the plans.
 The excavation and overreaming tools shall be of adequate design, size, and strength to
 perform the work shown on the plans or described herein. When the material encountered
 cannot be drilled using conventional earth augers with soil or rock teeth, drill buckets,
 and/or underreaming tools, the Contractor shall provide special drilling equipment
 including but not limited to: rock core barrels, rock tools, air tools, blasting materials, and
 
 916
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 other equipment as necessary to construct the shaft excavation to size and the depth
 required. Approval of the Engineer is required before excavation by blasting is permitted.
 Sidewall overreaming shall be required when the sidewall of the hole is determined by the
 Engineer to have either softened due to excavation methods or delays in excavation
 completion, swelled due to delays in concreting, or degraded because of slurry cake buildup. Overreaming thickness shall be a minimum of one-half inch (½”) and a maximum of
 three inches (3”) beyond the shaft radius. Overreaming may be accomplished with a
 grooving tool, overreaming bucket, or other approved equipment. The thickness and
 elevation of sidewall overreaming shall be as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor
 shall bear all costs associated with both sidewall overreaming and additional shaft concrete
 placement.
 803.03.2.3.7--Excavations.
 803.03.2.3.7.1--General. Shaft excavations shall be made at locations and to the top of
 shaft elevations, estimated bottom of shaft elevations, shaft geometry and dimensions
 shown in the plans. The Contractor shall extend drilled shaft tip elevations when the
 Geotechnical Engineer determines that the material encountered during excavation is
 unsuitable and/or differs from that anticipated in the design of the drilled shaft.
 The Contractor shall maintain a drilling log during shaft excavation. The log shall contain
 information such as: the description and approximate top and bottom elevation of each
 soil or rock strata, seepage or groundwater, and remarks. Three (3) copies of the final
 Contractor's log shall be furnished to the Engineer with a copy to the Geotechnical
 Engineer at the time the drilled shaft is completed and accepted.
 When shown on the plans, bells shall be excavated to form the height and bearing area of
 the size and shape shown. The bell shall be excavated by mechanical methods. Any drilled
 shaft concrete over the theoretical amount required to fill any excavations for the bells and
 shafts dimensioned on the plans shall be furnished at no additional cost to the State.
 The Contractor shall not permit workmen to enter a shaft excavation for any reason unless
 (a) both a suitable size casing has been installed and the water level has been lowered and
 stabilized below the level to be occupied, and (b) adequate safety equipment and
 procedures have been provided to workmen entering the excavation. The Contractor is
 responsible for complying with all State and Federal safety regulations.
 803.03.2.3.7.2--Obstructions. Surface and subsurface obstructions at drilled shaft
 locations shall be removed by the Contractor. Such obstructions may include man-made
 materials such as old concrete foundations and natural materials such as boulders. Special
 procedures and/or tools shall be employed by the Contractor after the hole cannot be
 advanced using conventional augers fitted with soil or rock teeth, drilling buckets and/or
 underreaming tools. Such special procedures/tools may include, but are not limited to,
 chisels, boulder breakers, core barrels, air tools, hand excavation, temporary casing, and
 increasing the diameter of the hole. Blasting shall not be permitted unless specifically
 approved in writing by the Engineer.
 Drilling tools that are lost in the excavation shall be promptly removed by the Contractor
 at no cost to the State. All costs due to lost tool removal shall be borne by the Contractor
 
 917
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 including, but not limited to, costs associated with hole degradation due to removal
 operations or the time the hole remains open.
 803.03.2.3.7.3--Exploration. When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall take
 soil samples or rock cores to determine the character of the material directly below the
 completed shaft excavation. The soil samples shall be extracted with a standard penetration
 test split spoon sampler or undisturbed sample (Shelby) tube. Rock cores, if required, shall
 be cut with an approved double or triple tube core barrel to a minimum of five (5) feet
 below the bottom of the drilled shaft excavation at the time the shaft excavation is
 approximately complete. Rock core, undisturbed tube, and/or standard penetration test
 samples shall be measured, visually identified, and described on the Contractor's log. The
 samples shall be placed in suitable containers, identified by shaft location, elevation, and
 project number, and delivered with the Contractor's field log to the Engineer within 24
 hours after the exploration is completed. The Engineer will inspect the samples or cores
 and determine the final depth of required excavation based on the evaluation of the
 material.
 803.03.2.3.7.4--Excavation Completion. Concrete placement must begin within two (2)
 hours of completion of shaft excavation. If the drilled shafts are five (5) feet in diameter
 or larger and in excess of sixty (60) feet in length, the elapsed time from completion of the
 drilled shaft excavation until beginning of concrete placement may extend past two hours
 provided the excavation remains stable and the extended time is demonstrated on the trial
 shaft. Completion of shaft excavation is defined as the time at which the specified tip
 elevation is initially achieved. Before concrete placement begins, bottom cleaning
 operations, any necessary slurry desanding, and placement of the reinforcing steel must be
 completed. These operations are included in the two hour time limit.
 If it becomes apparent, as the excavation of the shaft is nearing completion, that it will not
 be feasible or possible to place concrete within the specified limit, the Contractor shall halt
 excavation operations a minimum of five (5) feet above the specified tip elevation. In the
 event that the wet construction method is being used, the slurry should be desanded at this
 point so that the remaining excavation will not cause the slurry to be too heavily
 contaminated and delay concrete placement due to final desanding operations.
 In no case shall any excavation within the bearing zone(s) be allowed to remain open and
 idle for more than 24 hours. The bearing zone(s) are those soil strata located below the
 scour line, in the case of hydraulic structures, or five feet (5’) below the ground line,
 whichever is greatest in depth. In no instance shall any uncased excavation, except for trial
 shafts, be allowed to remain open and idle for more than 24 hours. For partially completed
 excavations that stand idle for more than six (6) hours but less than 24 hours, sidewall
 overreaming may still be required by the Engineer.
 If completion of shaft excavation has been achieved and concrete placement has not begun
 within the specified limit, the Contractor shall backfill and/or stabilize the excavation. The
 Engineer shall then direct the Contractor as to the additional shaft excavation that will be
 required to produce a sound drilled shaft due to shaft wall and bottom degradation. The
 cost of the additional excavation, concrete, reinforcing steel, and other incidentals will be
 borne by the Contractor at no additional cost to the State.
 803.03.2.3.7.5--Casings.
 
 918
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 803.03.2.3.7.5.1--General. Casings shall be steel, smooth, clean, watertight, and of ample
 strength to withstand both handling and driving stresses and the pressure of both concrete
 and the surrounding earth materials. The outside diameter of casing shall not be less than
 the specified size of the shaft. No extra compensation will be allowed for concrete required
 to fill an oversized casing or oversized excavations. All casings, except permanent casing,
 shall be removed from the shaft excavation. Any length of permanent casing installed
 below the shaft cutoff elevations shall remain in place.
 When the shaft is to extend above the ground or through a body of water, the portion
 exposed above the ground or through a body of water may be formed with removable
 casing, except when permanent casing is specified. Removable casing shall be stripped
 from the shaft in a manner that will not damage the concrete. Casings can be removed
 when (a) the concrete is cured for a full 72 hours; (b) the shaft concrete is not exposed to
 salt water or moving water for seven (7) days; and (c) the concrete reaches a compressive
 strength of at least 2500 psi as determined from concrete cylinder tests prepared and tested
 by the Department. The concrete cylinders will be prepared from material representative
 of the upper 10% mass of the newly constructed shaft and cured in conditions similar to
 the drilled shaft.
 803.03.2.3.7.5.2--Temporary Casing. All subsurface casing shall be considered
 temporary unless specifically shown as permanent in the contract documents. All
 temporary casing shall be removed. Telescoping, predrilling with slurry, and/or
 overreaming to beyond the outside diameter of the casing may be required to install the
 casing. When temporary casing larger than called for on the plans is used for telescoping
 or overreaming, no additional compensation will be made.
 If the Contractor elects to remove a casing and substitute a longer or larger diameter casing
 through caving soils, the excavation shall be either stabilized with slurry or backfilled
 before the new casing is installed, as directed in Subsection 803.03.2.3.4. Other methods,
 as approved by the Engineer, may be used to control the stability of the excavation and
 protect the integrity of the foundation soils.
 When temporary casings that are to be removed become fouled or bound in the shaft
 excavation and cannot be practically removed, and concreting has not yet begun, the
 Engineer may direct that the shaft excavation be drilled deeper to compensate for the loss
 of capacity due to the presence of the casing. No additional compensation will be paid for
 the casing left in the excavation. No additional length of shaft will be paid for beyond the
 current depth of excavation or the plan tip elevation of the production shaft, whichever is
 lower.
 Temporary casings that become bound or fouled during concreting of the shaft and that
 cannot be practically removed before the concrete begins to set up, shall constitute a defect
 in the drilled shaft. When the Engineer, in writing, notifies the Contractor of a defective
 shaft, the Contractor shall be responsible for improving such defective shafts to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. Improvements may consist of, but are not limited to, removing
 the shaft concrete and extending the shaft deeper to compensate for loss of frictional
 capacity in the cased zone, providing straddle shafts to compensate for capacity loss, proof
 load testing or providing replacement shafts. All corrective measures, including redesign
 of footings or drilled shaft caps, shall be performed to the satisfaction of the Engineer by
 the Contractor without either additional compensation or extension of Contract Time. No
 
 919
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 compensation will be paid for casing remaining in place. Any redesigns submitted must
 be approved in writing by the Bridge Engineer.
 Temporary casing extraction shall be slow and uniform, pulling along the axis of the shaft.
 The elevation of the concrete in the casing shall be maintained high enough to displace the
 drilling slurry between the outside of the casing and the edge of the hole as the casing is
 removed. Temporary casings shall be removed while the concrete remains workable. No
 temporary casings will be removed if the concrete slump is less than four (4) inches.
 Should this condition occur, the shaft will be considered defective, and corrections to the
 situation shall be as described above.
 Special casing systems may be used in open water areas, when approved and must be
 designed to permit removal after the concrete has hardened. Special casings shall be
 designed so that no damage occurs to the drilled shaft concrete during their removal. Any
 defects either cosmetic or structural that are apparent after removal of the casing or are due
 to the removal of the casing shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no
 additional cost to the State.
 In the event that permanent casing is not specified in the plans, and the Contractor elects
 to use a temporary casing and leave it in place, it shall be cut off at a maximum of 12 inches
 above the low water elevation as shown on the plans, or painted. Written approval from
 the Engineer is required in this event, and payment for the temporary casing left in place
 will be at the contract bid price for temporary casing.
 803.03.2.3.7.5.3--Permanent Casings. Permanent casing shall be used when shown on
 the plans. The casing shall be continuous between top and bottom elevations prescribed
 on the plans or as directed by the Engineer. Exterior surfaces of permanent casing shall be
 painted in accordance with the plans unless otherwise noted. After installation is complete,
 the permanent casing shall be cut off at the prescribed elevation and the shaft completed.
 In general, permanent casing shall not be placed in an overreamed shaft hole.
 803.03.2.3.8--Slurry. Mineral slurries shall be employed when slurry is used in the drilling
 process, unless other drilling fluids are approved in writing by the Engineer. The slurry
 shall have both a mineral grain size that will remain in suspension and sufficient viscosity
 and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to a suitable screening system. The
 percentage and specific gravity of the material used to make the suspension shall be
 sufficient to maintain the stability of the excavation and to allow proper concrete
 placement. During construction, the level of the slurry shall be maintained at a height
 sufficient to prevent caving of the hole. In the event there is a sudden, significant loss of
 slurry within the drilled shaft excavation, the construction of the drilled shaft shall be
 stopped until a method to stop slurry loss or an alternate construction procedure has been
 approved by the Engineer.
 Mineral slurry shall be premixed thoroughly with clean, fresh water, and an adequate time
 (as prescribed by the mineral manufacturer) shall be allotted for hydration, prior to
 introduction into the shaft excavation. Slurry tanks of adequate capacity will be required
 for slurry circulation, storage, and treatment. No excavated slurry pits will be allowed in
 lieu of slurry tanks, without the written permission of the Engineer. Desanding equipment
 shall be provided by the Contractor as necessary to control slurry sand content to less than
 two percent (2%) by volume at any point in the borehole. Desanding will not be required
 
 920
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 for setting sign posts or lighting mast foundations unless shown on the plans. The
 Contractor shall take all steps necessary to prevent the slurry from "setting up" in the shaft.
 Such methods may include, but are not limited to: agitation, circulation, and/or adjusting
 the properties of the slurry. Disposal of all slurry shall be performed offsite in suitable
 areas by the Contractor, and subject to all environmental regulations pertaining to slurry
 disposal.
 Control tests using suitable apparatus shall be carried out on the mineral slurry mixture by
 a qualified individual or qualified professional testing laboratory approved by the Engineer.
 Tests to be conducted will be density, sand content, viscosity, and pH. The acceptable
 range of values for those physical properties is as follows:

 Notes: a. Tests should be performed when the slurry temperature is above 40 degrees
 Fahrenheit.
 b. If desanding is required, sand content shall not exceed two percent (2%) by
 volume at any point in the borehole as determined by the American Petroleum
 Institute sand content test.
 The limits in the above table may be adjusted when field conditions warrant, as successfully
 demonstrated on the trial shaft or as directed by the Engineer. All changes must be
 approved in writing by the Engineer before continued use.
 Tests to determine density, viscosity, and pH value shall be performed during the shaft
 excavation to establish a consistent working pattern. A minimum of four (4) sets of tests
 shall be made during the first eight (8) hours of slurry use. When the results show
 consistent behavior, the testing frequency may be decreased to one set every four (4) hours
 of slurry use.
 The Contractor shall insure that heavily contaminated slurry suspension, that could impair
 the free flow of concrete, has not accumulated in the bottom of the shaft. Prior to placing
 concrete in any shaft excavation, the Contractor shall take slurry samples using a sampling
 tool approved by the Engineer or similar to that shown in Figure 2. Slurry samples shall
 be extracted from the base of the shaft and at intervals not exceeding 10 feet up the shaft,
 
 921
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 until two consecutive samples produce acceptable values for density, viscosity, pH, and
 sand content.
 When any slurry samples are found to be unacceptable, the Contractor shall take whatever
 action is necessary to bring the mineral slurry within specification requirements. Concrete
 shall not be poured until resampling and testing produce acceptable results.
 Reports of all tests required above, signed by an authorized representative of the
 Contractor, shall be furnished to the Engineer at the completion of each drilled shaft.
 Representatives of the Department may perform comparison tests as determined necessary
 during mineral slurry operations.
 During construction, the level of mineral slurry in the shaft excavation shall be maintained
 at a level not less than four (4) feet above the highest expected piezometric pressure head
 along the depth of the shaft. If at any time the slurry construction method fails to produce
 the desired final results, the Contractor shall discontinue this method and propose an
 alternate method for approval by the Engineer.
 Drilling tools should contain vents to stabilize hydrostatic pressure above and below the
 tool during extraction. The rate of tool extraction should not cause any noticeable
 turbulence in the hole.
 In locations where saline or chemically contaminated groundwater exists, the slurry should
 be adjusted with appropriate chemical additives, or developed with a mineral material not
 affected by such conditions.
 803.03.2.4--Excavation Inspection. The Contractor shall provide equipment for checking
 the dimensions and alignment of each drilled shaft excavation. The dimensions and
 alignment shall be determined by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer or the
 Engineer’s inspector. Final shaft depths shall be measured with a weighted tape or other
 approved methods after final cleaning. Unless otherwise stated on the plans, a minimum
 of 50 percent of the base of each shaft shall have less than 1/2 inch of sediment at the time
 of placement of the concrete. Shaft cleanliness will be determined by the Engineer, by
 visual inspection for dry shafts, or other methods deemed appropriate to the Engineer for
 wet shafts. In addition, for dry excavations, the maximum depth of water shall not exceed
 three (3) inches prior to concrete pour.

 803.03.2.5--Construction Tolerances. The following construction tolerances apply to
 drilled shafts unless otherwise stated in the contract documents:
 (a) The drilled shaft shall be within three (3) inches of plan position in the horizontal
 plane at the plan elevation for the top of the shaft.
 (b) The vertical alignment of a vertical shaft excavation shall not vary from the plan
 alignment by more than 1/4 inch per foot of depth.
 (c) After all the concrete is placed, the top of the reinforcing steel cage shall be not
 more than three (3) inches below plan elevation.
 (d) All casing diameters shown on the plans refer to O.D. (outside diameter)
 dimensions. The dimensions of casings are subject to American Pipe Institute
 tolerances applicable to regular steel pipe. When approved, the Contractor may
 elect to provide a casing larger in diameter than shown on the plans.
 (e) Bells shall be excavated to the plan bearing area and height shown on the plans
 as a minimum. The actual diameter of the bells shall not exceed three (3) times
 the specified shaft diameter. All other plan dimensions shown for the bells may
 be varied, when approved, to accommodate the Contractor’s equipment.
 (f) Top elevation of the shaft shall have a tolerance of plus one (1) inch or minus
 three (3) inches from the plan top of shaft elevation.
 (g) Excavation equipment and methods shall be designed so that the completed shaft
 excavation will have a planar bottom. The cutting edges of excavation equipment
 shall be normal to the vertical axis of the equipment within a tolerance of ±3/8
 inch per foot of shaft diameter.
 Drilled shaft excavations and completed shafts not constructed within the required
 tolerances are unacceptable. The Contractor shall be responsible for correcting all
 unacceptable shaft excavations and completed shafts to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Materials and work necessary, including engineering analysis and redesign, to complete
 corrections for out of tolerance drilled shaft excavations shall be furnished without either
 cost to the State or an extension of the completion dates of the project. Any redesign shall
 be performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Mississippi and engaged
 by the Contractor. Redesign drawings and computations prepared by the Contractor's
 engineer shall be signed and sealed.
 Out of tolerance shaft holes shall be backfilled in an approved manner, when directed by
 the Engineer, until the redesign is complete and approved.
 803.03.2.6--Reinforcing Steel Construction and Placement. The reinforcing steel cage,
 consisting of longitudinal bars, ties, cage stiffener bars, spacers, centralizers, and other
 necessary appurtenances, shall be completely assembled and placed as a unit immediately
 after the shaft excavation is inspected and accepted, and prior to concrete placement.
 Details of reinforcing steel will be as shown in the plans.
 The reinforcing steel in the shaft shall be double-wire tied at all junctions and supported so
 that the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable tolerances given in Subsection
 803.03.2.5. Stiff tie wire may be required for long reinforcing steel cages. Free-rolling
 concrete centralizers or other approved noncorrosive rolling centralizer devices shall be
 used at sufficient intervals. The centralizers shall be attached to the reinforcing steel cage
 near the bottom, and at intervals not exceeding 10 feet up the shaft for shaft lengths less
 than 60 feet, and intervals not exceeding seven (7) feet for shaft lengths greater than 60
 
 924
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 feet, to ensure concentric spacing for the entire cage length. Centralizers shall be
 constructed of approved material equal in quality and durability to the concrete specified
 for the shaft. The centralizers shall be of adequate dimension to insure a minimum five (5)
 inch annular space between the outside of the reinforcing cage and the side of the excavated
 hole. Approved cylindrical feet (bottom supports) shall be provided to ensure that the
 bottom of the cage is maintained the proper distance above the base.
 The elevation of the top of the steel cage shall be checked before and after the concrete is
 placed. If the rebar cage is not maintained within the specified tolerances, corrections shall
 be made by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Engineer. No additional shafts shall
 be constructed until the Contractor has modified the rebar cage support in a manner
 satisfactory to the Engineer.
 If the bottom of the excavated shaft elevation is lower than the bottom of the shaft elevation
 shown on the plans, all reinforcement required in the upper portion of the shaft shall be
 achieved by splicing the additional length at the bottom of the cage, to avoid congestion in
 the upper portion of the shaft.
 803.03.2.7--Concrete Placement.
 803.03.2.7.1--General. Drilled Shaft concrete shall meet the requirements in Section 804.
 Concrete placement during cold weather shall be allowed when ambient air conditions are
 at or expected to drop below 40°F, but protection of the fresh concrete shall be in
 accordance with the provisions stated in Sections 804 and 501. The Contractor shall
 assume all responsibility for protection of fresh concrete in cold weather.
 Concrete shall be placed as soon as possible after reinforcing steel placement. Concrete
 placement shall be continuous from the bottom to the top elevation of the shaft. Concrete
 placement shall continue after the shaft excavation is full until good quality concrete is
 evident at the top of the shaft. Concrete shall be placed either through a tremie, concrete
 pump or free fall. Free fall placement shall require prior written approval of the Engineer
 and shall be restricted for use in dry excavations only.
 For tremied or pumped concrete, the elapsed time from the beginning of concrete placement
 in the shaft to the completion of the placement shall not exceed four (4) hours, except as
 noted below. Retarders and/or water reducers in the concrete mixture shall be adjusted as
 approved for the conditions encountered on the project, so that the concrete remains in a
 workable plastic state throughout the four-hour placement limit. A workable plastic state
 is defined as a minimum slump of four inches (4”) existing everywhere within the concrete
 shaft after placement has been completed. Prior to concrete placement, the Contractor shall
 provide test results meeting the requirements of Subsection 804.02.10 and a slump loss test
 per the requirements in Subsection 804.02.10.3.1. The Contractor may request a longer
 placement time, provided a concrete mixture is supplied that will maintain a slump of four
 inches (4”) or greater over the longer placement time, as demonstrated by slump loss tests.
 In the event that free-fall concrete placement is approved and used, the 4-inch slump in four
 hours requirement will be waived.
 The Contractor shall place the concrete within the approved time and temperature
 limitations determined by the trial mix demonstration.
 
 925
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 Before the casing is withdrawn, the fresh concrete shall be at such a level that the fluid
 trapped behind the casing is displaced upward. As the casing is withdrawn, care shall be
 exercised to maintain the level of concrete within the casing so that the fluid trapped behind
 the casing is displaced upward out of the shaft excavation without mixing with or
 displacing the shaft concrete.
 803.03.2.7.2--Tremies. Tremies used for concrete placement in either wet or dry
 excavations shall consist of a tube of sufficient length, weight, and diameter to discharge
 concrete at the shaft base elevation. The tremie shall not contain aluminum parts that will
 have contact with the concrete. The tremie inside diameter shall be at least six (6) times
 the maximum size of aggregate used in the concrete mix but shall not be less than 10 inches.
 The inside and outside surfaces of the tremie shall be clean and smooth to permit both flow
 of concrete and unimpeded withdrawal during concreting. The wall thickness of the tremie
 shall be adequate to prevent crimping or sharp bends that restrict concrete placement.
 The tremie used for wet excavation concrete placement shall be watertight. Underwater
 placement shall not begin until the tremie is placed at the bottom of the excavation. Valves,
 bottom plates, or plugs may be used only if concrete discharge can begin within one tremie
 diameter of the base. Plugs and plates shall either be removed from the excavation or be
 of a material, approved by the Engineer, that will not cause a defect in the shaft if not
 removed. The discharge end of the tremie shall be constructed to permit the free radial
 flow of concrete during placement operations. The tremie discharge end shall remain at
 the excavation bottom as long as possible, and thereafter be immersed at least two shaft
 diameters but not less than 10 feet in concrete at all times after starting the flow of concrete.
 The flow of concrete shall be continuous. The concrete in the tremie shall be maintained
 at a positive pressure differential at all times to prevent water or slurry intrusion into the
 shaft concrete.
 If, at any time during the concrete pour in a wet excavation, the tremie line orifice is
 removed from the fluid concrete column and discharges concrete above the rising concrete
 level, the shaft shall be considered defective. In such case, the Contractor shall remove the
 reinforcing cage and concrete, complete all necessary sidewall removal directed by the
 Engineer and repour the shaft. All costs of replacement of defective shafts shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor.
 803.03.2.7.3--Pumping Concrete. Concrete pumps and lines may be used for concrete
 placement in either wet or dry excavations. All pump lines shall have a minimum 5-inch
 diameter and be constructed with watertight joints. The use of aluminum pipe as a
 conveyance for the concrete will not be permitted. Concrete placement shall not begin
 until the pump line discharge orifice is at the bottom of the excavation.
 For wet excavations, a plug or similar device shall be used to separate the concrete from
 the fluid in the hole until pumping begins. The plug shall either be removed from the
 excavation or be of a material, approved by the Engineer, that will not cause a defect in the
 shaft if not removed.
 The discharge orifice shall remain at least two shaft diameters but not less than 10 feet
 below the surface of the fluid concrete at all times after starting the flow of concrete. When
 lifting the pump line during concreting, the Contractor shall temporarily reduce the line
 pressure until the orifice has been repositioned at a higher level in the excavation.
 
 926
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 If, at any time during the concrete pour, the pump line orifice is removed from the fluid
 concrete column and discharges concrete above the rising level, the shaft shall be
 considered defective. In such case, the Contractor shall remove the reinforcing cage and
 concrete, complete all necessary sidewall removal directed by the Engineer and re-pour the
 shaft. All costs of replacement of defective shafts shall be the responsibility of the
 Contractor.
 803.03.2.7.4--Free Fall Method. Placement of concrete by the free fall method will be
 permitted only when approved in writing by the Engineer. Approval of concrete placement
 by the free fall method shall be contingent upon the following conditions:
 (a) The clear opening inside the reinforcing cage is not less than 24 inches in
 diameter.
 (b) The dry construction method is used in constructing the drilled shafts.
 (c) The height of free fall placement shall not exceed 75 feet.
 (d) Concrete shall fall directly to the placement location without contacting either the
 reinforcing cage or shaft walls.
 (e) A hopper shall be used at the top of the shaft to center and direct free fall
 placement.
 (f) The Engineer will observe the falling of the concrete within the shaft. The
 Contractor shall reduce the rate of concrete placement or reduce the height of free
 fall as directed by the Engineer when the concrete strikes the reinforcing cage or
 shaft sidewalls, when there is excessive spatter from the impact of the falling
 concrete, or when concrete placement causes the shaft excavation to cave or
 slough.
 (g) When in the opinion of the Engineer, placement cannot be satisfactorily
 accomplished by the free fall method, the Contractor shall change to either the
 tremie or pumping method to accomplish the pour.
 803.03.2.8--Drilled Shaft Load Tests. The methods required for the load testing of drilled
 shafts shall be Static and/or Static with Special Instrumentation. Load testing of drilled
 shafts shall be completed before construction of any production drilled shafts, and the
 results used by the Bridge Engineer to determine the drilled shaft lengths given on the order
 list. The method, number, and locations of load tests shall be as shown on the plans or as
 designated by the Engineer.
 After completion of any load test, the order list providing the final production lengths will
 be provided within two weeks of receiving the load test results. The production shaft
 lengths provided by the Bridge Engineer may differ from the individual shaft lengths
 shown on the plans. Requests for adjustment to the contract due to changes in shaft lengths
 shall be subject to the provisions of Subsection 104.02.1. Before any consideration will be
 given for an adjustment to the contract, it must be determined that a significant change in
 the character of the work has occurred.
 803.03.2.8.1--Static Load Tests. Static load testing shall not begin until the concrete has
 attained a compressive strength of 3000 psi as determined from cylinder tests, or maturity
 meter probe in accordance with Subsection 803.03.2.3.1.1. If a maturity meter probe is
 used, it shall be located in the last concrete placed. During the curing time, no other
 
 927
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 construction or operations that will induce excessive vibration levels, as previously
 discussed, shall be performed.
 Static axial load tests shall be performed by personnel of the Department’s Geotechnical
 Branch assisted by the Contractor’s personnel using the procedures as described in ASTM
 D 1143, quick test method. No weighted platforms to totally supply the axial load are
 allowed.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing the following:
 (a) A reaction frame capable of resisting a total load of at least four (4) times the
 design load of the test shaft shall be provided. The frame shall consist of a
 beam(s) or girder(s) that will carry the required load while sustaining only minor
 deflections in the reaction system. The beam or girder shall be attached to a
 system of anchor shafts or piles. The anchor piles shall not be closer than three
 (3) diameters measured from the center of the test shaft.
 (b) A hydraulic jack that has been calibrated for the full range of anticipated loads in
 accordance with AASHTO T 67 (ASTM E 4) at least once shall be provided. The
 maximum anticipated load shall be assumed to be four (4) times the design load
 for the test shaft. The pressure gauge shall be calibrated within one year preceding
 time of use. The Contractor shall furnish a certificate of calibration for the
 hydraulic jack at the time of load testing.

 movement. Each dial gauge will be actuated by its stem or by a stem attachment
 resting on the measuring frame. The supports for the measuring frame shall be
 placed the maximum practical distance from the test pile and the anchor shafts or
 piles. In no case shall the measuring frame be affected by movement of the test
 shaft or the anchor shafts or piles.
 The Geotechnical Branch will furnish the load cell, gages, any needed details of the shaft
 gauge locations and personnel to run the test. The Geotechnical Branch shall also be
 responsible for reviewing and submitting the results to the Bridge Engineer. The Contractor

 Section 803
 
 After the completion of testing, the test shafts and any anchor shafts shall be cut off at an
 elevation two (2) feet below the finished ground surface. The portion of the shafts cut off
 and removed shall remain the property of the Contractor.
 803.03.2.8.2--Load Testing of Drilled Shafts With Special Instrumentation.
 803.03.2.8.2.1--General. When designated on the plans, a dedicated test shaft shall be
 constructed as detailed in the plans with instrumentation and hydraulic jack(s) cast in the
 concrete of the drilled shaft. The Contractor will be required to furnish all materials,
 equipment, labor, and incidentals necessary for conducting the load test and reporting the
 results. The Contractor shall subcontract the instrumenting, conducting, and reporting of
 the load test to the company supplying the instrumentation with the cost included in the
 contract unit price for test shaft.
 No reaction systems and extra drilled shaft installations such as anchor shafts are required
 for conducting the load test. The load test is a non-destructive test, and if the test shaft
 designated on the plans is a production shaft, it shall be left in a condition suitable for use
 as a production shaft in the finished structure.
 803.03.2.8.2.2--Materials. When called for in the plans, instrumentation shall be supplied
 to meet the requirements set forth in the plans. Instrumentation required in the plans is

 and/or instrumentation supplier, for testing over water or in otherwise unstable
 foundation conditions.
 803.03.2.8.2.4--Procedure. The test shaft shall be constructed by the shaft construction
 technique approved by the Engineer after trial shaft construction. The test shaft shall then
 be constructed in accordance with the plans and at the direction of the Engineer.
 The instrumentation shall be assembled and made ready for installation under the direction
 of the instrumentation supplier, in a suitable area that is adjacent to the test shaft. When a
 reinforcing cage is required for the test shaft, the instrumentation shall be placed as directed
 in the plans.
 When the test shaft excavation has been completed and accepted by the Engineer, the
 Contractor shall then install the instrumentation and, if required, the reinforcing cage
 assembly in the test shaft under the direction of the Engineer. The Contractor shall use the
 utmost care in handling the reinforcing cage and test equipment assembly so as not to
 damage the instrumentation during installation.
 After the installation of the instrumentation, the test shaft shall be concreted in the manner
 approved from the trial shaft construction. Load testing shall not begin until the concrete
 has attained a compressive strength of 3000 psi as determined from cylinder tests. During
 the curing period, no other construction or operations that will induce excessive vibration
 levels shall be performed.
 After completion of the load test, and at the direction of the Engineer, the Contractor shall
 remove any items, including equipment and material that are not to be a part of the finished
 structure.
 The Contractor shall supply the Engineer with six (6) copies of the final load test report.
 803.04--Method of Measurement.
 803.04.1--Test Piles. Test piles will be measured per each complete-in-place. Piles
 measured as test piles will not be included in the measurement of pay footage for permanent
 piles.
 Test piles constructed in accordance with the lengths indicated on the plans and that are
 required to be extended or built up will be measured as a percentage, calculated by dividing
 
 930
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 the sum of the plan length plus the length of the ordered extension or build-up, by the plan
 length. Splices required for the extension(s) will not be measured for payment.
 No measurement for payment will be made for cut-off of a test pile.
 803.04.2--Conventional Static Pile Load Tests. Conventional static pile load tests will
 be measured by the actual number of static load tests conducted on either a test pile or
 permanent production pile in accordance with these specifications.
 In the event a pile is reloaded in accordance with these specifications, the reloading will be
 measured for payment as 50 percent of a separate conventional static pile load test.
 803.04.3--Pile Shoes. Pile shoes of approved design, ordered and used, will be measured
 and paid as set out in Subsection 803.05.3.
 803.04.4--Piling. Piling, exclusive of those measured as test piles, will be measured by
 the linear foot for each class and size of piling, furnished and installed in accordance with
 the lengths shown on the plans or as approved by the Department’s Bridge Engineer. Cutoffs for each individual pile will be measured and deducted as set forth in Subsection
 803.04.5.
 Pile lengths in excess of those shown on the plans or approved by the Bridge Engineer will
 not be measured for payment unless such additional lengths below cut-off are approved in
 writing by the Bridge Engineer for incorporation in the structure.
 803.04.5--Cut-Off. The summation of all cut-offs shall be deducted at 40 percent to
 determine the length for payment of in-place permanent piling.
 The summation of all cut-offs for pile lengths in excess of those shown on the plans or
 approved by the Bridge Engineer will be deducted at 100 percent to determine the length
 for payment of in-place permanent piling.
 An allowance will be made for prestressed concrete piling cut-offs in accordance with the
 provisions of Subsection 803.05.5. Cut-offs shall be measured for payment per each for
 each pile requiring cut-off.
 All piling cut-offs shall become the property of and shall be disposed of by the Contractor.
 803.04.6--Extensions or Build-Ups. Extensions or build-ups will not be measured for
 payment as such, but will be included in the length of piling remaining in the finished
 structure. In determining the amount to be included in piling footage, no allowance will
 be made for cut-offs necessary to accomplish the extensions or build-ups.
 803.04.7--Falsework and Defective Piles. No allowance will be made for furnishing or
 driving of falsework piles, for piles driven out of place, for defective piles, or for piles
 damaged by handling or driving.
 803.04.8--Splices. Splices necessary for extensions or build-ups on bearing piles will be
 measured by the linear foot. For prestressed concrete piles, the number of linear feet will
 be determined by allowing seven linear feet of piling for each splice. For other piles, the
 number of linear feet will be determined by allowing four linear feet of piling for each
 
 931
 
 Section 803
 
 Section 803
 
 splice. The total number of linear feet of piling to be paid for shall be determined by adding
 seven feet or four feet, as applicable, to the net length of piling for each splice in place in
 the finished structure.
 No measurement or payment will be made for splices except those made at the direction
 and under the supervision of the Engineer.
 803.04.9--Pre-formed Pile Holes. Pre-formed pile holes, when included as a pay item on
 the plans, will be measured by the linear foot. For trestle type bents, the footage for each
 hole will be determined by subtracting the elevation of the bottom of the hole shown on
 the itemized list from the elevation of the natural ground at the pile site or from the
 elevation of the excavated section, whichever is lower. For foundations and end bents, the
 footage will be determined by subtracting the elevation of the bottom of the hole as shown
 on the itemized list from the elevation of the bottom of the footing or the bottom of the end
 bent caps, as applicable.
 803.04.10--PDA Test Piles and Special Instrumentation Load Test. PDA test piles and
 special instrumentation load test will be measured per each, which shall include a static
 load test with special instrumentation. Piles paid for as PDA test piles, special
 instrumentation load test, will not be included in the measurement of pay lengths for
 permanent piles.
 Completion of this pay item shall include the 1-day restrike after the initial pile driving,
 the special instrumentation load test, and the restrike within 24 hours after the static load
 test and the individual components will not be considered separately. Any additional
 restrike required by the Engineer on this type test pile will be paid for as a PDA Restrike.
 803.04.11--PDA Test Piles and Conventional Load Test. PDA test piles and
 conventional load test, will be measured per each, which shall include a static load test.
 Piles paid for as PDA test piles and conventional load test will not be included in the
 measurement of pay lengths for permanent piles.

 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 Also, an approved synthetic structural fiber meeting the requirements of Subsection 711.04 shall
 be incorporated into the mixture at 1.25 times the approved dosage rate. For each additional
 pound of fibers per cubic yard added in excess of the requirement stated above, an additional
 inch of slump will be allowed up to a maximum permitted slump of eight (8) inches.
 2
 
 Entrained air is not required for Class F, FX, and DS concrete unless exposed to seawater. For
 concrete not exposed to seawater, the total air content shall not exceed 6.0%. For concrete
 exposed to seawater, the nominal total air content shall be 4.5%.
 Note: Brackets [#] indicate minus slump tolerances.

 The design slump selected by the Contractor for the mix design approval is the maximum slump
 permitted.
 
 Lightweight aggregate (LWA) meeting the requirements of Subsection 703.19.2 may also
 be used as a partial replacement for fine aggregate. The replacement limits of hydraulic
 cement by weight by other cementitious materials (such as fly ash, GGBFS, silica fume, or
 others) shall be in accordance with the values in Subsection 701.02. Other hydraulic
 cements may be used in accordance with the specifications listed in Section 701
 At least one water-reducing admixture or water-reducing/set-retarding admixture shall be
 used in all classes of concrete in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended dosage
 range. Admixtures providing a specific performance characteristic other than those of
 water reduction or set retardation may be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommended dosage range. Accelerating admixtures shall not be used unless approved
 by the State Materials Engineer. Any combinations of admixtures shall be approved by
 the Engineer before their use.
 804.02.10.1--Proportioning of Hydraulic Cement Concrete Mixture Design.
 Proportioning of hydraulic cement concrete shall be based on an existing mixture of which
 the producer has field experience and documentation or based on a recently batched
 laboratory mixture tested according to the required specifications.
 804.02.10.1.1--Proportioning on the Basis of Previous Field Experience of Trial
 Mixtures. Where a concrete production facility has a record, based on at least 10
 consecutive strength tests from at least 10 different batches within the past 12 months from
 a mixture not previously used on Department projects, the standard deviation shall be
 calculated. The record of tests from which the standard deviation is calculated shall:
 (a) Represent similar materials and conditions to those expected. Changes in
 materials and proportions within the test record shall not have been more closely
 restricted than those for the proposed work.
 (b) Represent concrete produced to meet a specified strength.
 (c) Consist of 10 consecutive tests, average of two cylinders per test, tested at 28
 days. For concrete categorized as a self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixture,
 the test data for the plastic concrete shall include the slump flow data, instead of
 the slump data, and at least one test to determine the static segregation. For all
 mixture designs, for each of these tests on the plastic concrete the test data shall
 meet the acceptance criteria of Subsection 804.02.13.1.
 
 942
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 The standard deviation, s, shall be calculated as:
 	
 
 	
 
 1
 
 /
 
 where:
 Xi
 
 = the strength result of an individual test
 
 X = the average of individual tests in the series
 N
 
 = number of tests in the series
 
 When the concrete production facility does not have a record of tests for calculation of
 standard deviation, as required in the above formula, the requirements of Subsection
 804.02.10.1.2 shall govern.
 The required average compressive strength (f’cr) used as the basis for selection of concrete
 proportions shall conform to the inequality listed below, while using a standard deviation,
 s, calculated as shown above.
 
 X  f’cr
 where:
 f’cr = f’c + 1.43s
 where:
 f’c = specified compressive strength of concrete, psi
 f’cr = required average compressive strength of concrete, psi
 s = standard deviation, psi
 1.43 represents the Lower Quality Index necessary to assure that 93% of
 compressive strength tests are above f’c.
 804.02.10.1.2--Proportioning on the Basis of Laboratory Trial Mixtures. When an
 acceptable record of field test results is not available, concrete proportions shall be
 established based on laboratory trial mixtures meeting the following restrictions:
 (a) The combination of materials shall be those intended for use in the proposed work.
 (b) Trial mixtures having proportions and consistencies suitable for the proposed
 work shall be made using the ACI 211.1 as a guide to proportion the mixture
 design.
 (c) Trial mixtures shall be designed to produce a slump within ¾ inch of the design
 slump allowed, and for air-entrained concrete, 0.5 percent of the maximum
 permitted air content in Table 3. The temperature of freshly mixed concrete in

 concrete mixtures that do not meet the cement replacement requirements of Subsection
 701.02.2, the maximum acceptance temperature is 95°F.
 The maximum acceptance temperature for all other concrete mixtures meeting the cement
 replacement requirements of Subsection 701.02.2 is 95°F. The maximum acceptance
 temperature for all other concrete mixtures that do not meet the cement replacement
 requirements of Subsection 701.02.2 is 90°F.
 804.02.13.1.6--Compressive Strength. Standard cured concrete compressive strength
 tests shall conform to the specified strength (f’c) listed in the specifications. Concrete
 represented by compressive strength test below the specified strength (f’c) may be removed
 and replaced by the Contractor. If the Contractor elects not to remove the material, it will
 be evaluated by the Department as to the adequacy for the use intended. All concrete
 evaluated as unsatisfactory for the intended use shall be removed and replaced by the
 Contractor at no additional cost to the Department. For concrete allowed to remain in
 place, reduction in payment will be as follows:
 Projects with 1000 Cubic Yards and More. When the evaluation indicates that the work
 may remain in place, a statistical analysis will be made of the QC and QA concrete test
 results. If this statistical analysis indicates that at least 93% of the material would be
 expected to have a compressive strength equal to or greater than the specified strength (f’c)
 and 99.87% of the material would be expected to have a compressive strength of at least
 one standard deviation above the allowable design stress (fc), the work will be accepted.
 If the statistical analysis indicates that either of the two criteria is not met, the Engineer

 804.02.13.1.7--Static Segregation. For concrete categorized as a SCC mixture, the static
 segregation of the plastic concrete shall meet the requirements of Subsection 804.02.10.1.2.
 If the static segregation of the concrete mix design exceeds this requirement, the mix shall
 be adjusted by a Class III Certified Technician representing the Contractor to ensure a static
 segregation less than the maximum allowable. If batching of the proportions of the mixture
 design varies outside the batching tolerance range of the originally approved proportions
 by more than the tolerances allowed in Subsection 804.02.12.1, the new proportions shall
 be field verified per Subsection 804.02.10.3.
 804.02.14--Dispute Resolution. Disputes over variations between the Contractor’s QC
 test results and the Department’s QA test results shall be resolved at the lowest possible
 
 954
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 level using the latest edition of the Department’s Concrete Field Manual. When there are
 significant discrepancies between the QC test results and the QA test results, the
 Contractor’s QC Manager, the Project Engineer, and/or the District Materials Engineer
 shall look for differences in the procedures, and correct the inappropriate procedure before
 requesting a third party resolution.
 If the dispute cannot be resolved at the project or District level, the Department’s Materials
 Division will serve as a third party to resolve the dispute. The Materials Division’s
 decision shall be binding.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the cost associated with the third party resolution
 if the final decision is such that the Department’s QA test results were correct. Likewise,
 the Department will be responsible for the cost when the final decision is such that the
 Contractor’s QC test results were correct.
 804.03--Construction Requirements.
 804.03.1--Measurement of Materials.
 804.03.1.1--General. The accuracy for measuring materials shall be in accordance with
 AASHTO M 157.
 804.03.1.2--Measurement by Weighing. Except when otherwise specified or authorized,
 the materials shall be measured by weighing. The apparatus provided for weighing
 materials shall be suitably designed and constructed for this purpose. Cementitious
 materials and aggregates shall be weighed separately. Cement in standard bags need not
 be weighed, but bulk cement and other cementitious materials shall be weighed. The
 mixing water shall be measured by volume or by weight. All measuring devices shall be
 subject to approval.
 804.03.2--Blank.
 804.03.3--Blank.
 804.03.4--Hand Mixing. Hand mixing of concrete will not be allowed.
 804.03.5--Delivery. The plant supplying concrete shall have sufficient capacity and
 transporting apparatus to ensure continuous delivery at the rate required. The rate of
 delivery shall be such as to provide for the proper continuity in handling, placing, and
 furnishing of the concrete. The rate shall be such that the interval between batches shall
 not exceed 20 minutes. The methods of delivering and handling the concrete shall be that
 which will facilitate placing with minimum re-handling and without damage to the
 structure or the concrete.
 804.03.6--Handling and Placing Concrete.
 804.03.6.1--General. Prior to placing concrete, all reinforcement shall have been
 accurately placed in the position shown on the plans and fastened as set out in Section 805.
 All sawdust, chips, and other construction debris and extraneous matter shall have been
 removed from the interior of the forms. Temporary struts, braces, and stays holding the
 forms in correct shape and alignment shall be removed when the concrete placing has
 
 955
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 reached an elevation rendering their service unnecessary. These temporary members shall
 be entirely removed from the forms and shall not be buried in the concrete.
 No concrete shall be placed until the forms and reinforcement have been inspected.
 Except as provided for truck mixers and truck agitators, concrete shall be placed in the
 forms within 30 minutes after the time that the cement is first added to the mixture.
 Concrete shall be placed so as to avoid segregation of materials and displacement of
 reinforcement. The use of troughs, chutes, and pipes over 25 feet in length for gravity
 conveyance of concrete to the forms will not be permitted except when authorized by the
 Engineer and subject to the production of quality concrete.
 Only approved mechanical conveyors will be permitted.
 Open troughs and chutes shall be metal or metal lined. The use of aluminum pipes, chutes,
 or other devices made of aluminum that come into direct contact with the concrete shall
 not be used. Where steep slopes are required, the chutes shall be equipped with baffles or
 be in short sections that change the direction of movement.
 All chutes, troughs, and pipes shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened
 concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after each run. Water used for flushing shall
 be discharged clear of the structure.
 When placing operations involve dropping the concrete more than five feet, it shall be
 deposited through sheet metal or other approved pipes to prevent segregation and
 unnecessary splashing. The pipes shall be made in sections to permit discharging and
 raising as the placement progresses. A non-jointed pipe may be used if sufficient openings
 of the proper size are provided to allow for the flow of the concrete into the shaft. As far
 as practicable, the pipes shall be kept full of concrete during placing, and their ends shall
 be kept buried in the newly placed concrete.
 Except as herein provided, concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers not more than 12
 inches thick. When, with the Engineer's approval, less than the complete length of a layer
 is placed in one operation, it shall be terminated in a vertical bulkhead. Each layer shall be
 placed and compacted before the preceding layer has taken its initial set and shall be
 compacted so as to avoid the formation of a construction joint with the preceding layer.
 If the Department determines that there is an excessive number of projections, swells,
 ridges, depressions, waves, voids, holes, honeycombs, or other defects in the completed
 structure, removal of the entire structure may be required as set out in Subsection 105.12.
 804.03.6.2--Consolidation. Immediately after depositing the concrete mixture, the
 concrete mixture shall be thoroughly consolidated by the use of approved mechanical
 vibrators and suitable spading tools. Only concrete mixture that has not achieved initial
 set shall be consolidated. Hand spading alone will be permitted on small structural
 members such as railing, small culvert headwalls, and as necessary to ensure smooth
 surfaces and dense concrete along form surfaces, in corners, and in locations impossible to
 reach with vibrators. When hand spading is used for consolidation, a sufficient number of
 workmen with spading tools shall be provided. For hand spading, flush a thin layer of
 
 956
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 mortar to all the surfaces and thoroughly and satisfactorily consolidate the concrete. SCC
 concrete shall not be consolidated by vibration.
 The Contractor shall conduct operations of depositing and consolidating the concrete
 mixture such that the operation produces concrete that is uniformly smooth and dense,
 having no honeycombing or pockets of segregated aggregate.
 Movement of personnel through the consolidated concrete shall not be permitted. If it is
 determined that it is necessary to step into previously consolidated concrete, the concrete
 in the stepped into area shall be consolidated again.
 804.03.6.2.1--Requirements for Vibrators. Mechanical vibrators shall be subject to the
 following:
 
 (a) To verify compliance with these requirements, the Contractor shall provide the
 Engineer with a copy of the manufacturer’s specifications for each type and brand
 of vibrator used on the project.
 (b) The Contractor shall provide a sufficient number of personnel with vibrators to
 properly consolidate each batch immediately after the concrete is placed in the
 forms. The Contractor shall provide at least one stand-by vibrator and required
 power source.
 (c) Concrete that has been consolidated shall not be walked in or through. If it is
 determined it is necessary to step into previously consolidated concrete, the concrete
 in the stepped into area shall be consolidated again.
 (d) Internal vibrators shall be of the spud or tube type, meeting the following
 characteristics and performance:
 (1) The diameter of the head of the vibrator shall be 1¼ to 2½ inches.
 (2) The frequency of vibration shall be 8000 to 12000 vibrations per minute (Hz)
 while operating in the concrete.
 (3) The average amplitude shall be 0.025 to 0.05 inch while operating in air.
 (4) The minimum radius of influence shall be seven (7) inches.
 (5) The length of the vibrator head shall be nearly equal to the depth of the layer of
 concrete placed.
 (e) When the reinforcing steel is coated with epoxy, internal vibrators with heads of
 rubber or other resilient material shall be used. Rubber covers securely fastened
 over steel heads shall be acceptable.
 (f) For consolidation of concrete used in concrete bridge decks, the following additional
 requirements shall apply:
 (1) Only internal vibration shall be used.
 (2) Internal vibrators shall all be of the same type and size.
 (3) The configuration of the internal vibrators shall meet the requirements of
 Subsection 804.03.6.2.3.
 804.03.6.2.2--Operation of Internal Vibration. Mechanical vibrators used for internal
 vibration shall be operated as follows:
 
 (a) Vibrators shall not be dragged or moved laterally through the concrete to transport
 concrete. Vibrators shall not be used in such a manner that the concrete segregates
 or forms pockets of grout. Vibrators shall not be applied directly or through the
 reinforcement to sections or layers of concrete that have taken initial set.
 
 957
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 (b) Vibrators shall only be inserted into the concrete while operating and at the point of
 placement to consolidate the concrete for such a length of time that there is a general
 cessation in the escape of large entrapped air bubbles at the surface.
 (c) Vibrators shall be inserted slowly into the concrete and allowed to penetrate into the
 concrete under their own weight.
 (d) Vibrators shall be inserted into the concrete while they are in a vertical position with
 enough flexibility to work themselves around the reinforcing steel.
 (e) The head of the vibrator shall be completely submerged in the concrete for a time
 of consolidation between 3 and 15 seconds prior to removal, unless otherwise
 defined by the Engineer.
 (f) For consolidation of two or more layers of concrete, the vibrator shall be inserted
 into the bottom most layer at least six (6) inches. The vibrator shall be manipulated
 in a series of up-and-down motions to knit the layers together.
 (g) Vibrators shall be removed slowly from the concrete after the consolidation has been
 accomplished. However, once the head of the vibrator has become only partially
 immersed in the concrete, vibrators shall be removed rapidly.
 (h) The insertions of the vibrators shall be systematically spaced such that the entire
 surface of the concrete comes under the influence of the vibrator during
 consolidation. This includes areas around the reinforcing steel, imbedded fixtures,
 the corners and angles of forms, and any irregular areas. The distance between
 insertions shall not exceed 1.5 times the radius of influence such that the area visibly
 affected by the vibrator overlaps the adjacent, just-vibrated area.
 (i) For additional information, refer to ACI 309-07, Chapter 7, Sections 7.1 through 7.3
 804.03.6.2.3--Method of Consolidation. The Contractor will accomplish consolidation
 by internal vibration using vibrators mounted on a mechanical device or an orchestrated
 effort utilizing personnel. Regardless of the chosen method, the method shall be included
 in the QCP in accordance with Subsection 804.02.12.1 and shall only receive tentative
 approval until the method is demonstrated as effectively meeting the requirements of
 Subsection 804.03.6.2.
 804.03.6.3--Discontinuance of Placing. When placing is temporarily discontinued, the
 concrete, after becoming firm enough to retain its form, shall be cleaned of laitance and
 other objectionable material to a sufficient depth to expose sound concrete. To avoid
 visible joints insofar as possible upon exposed faces, the top surface of the concrete
 adjacent to the forms shall be smoothed with a trowel. Where a "feather edge" might be
 produced at a construction joint, such as in the sloped top surface of a wing wall, an inset
 form work shall be used in the preceding layer to produce a blocked out portion that will
 provide an edge thickness of at least six inches (6”) in the succeeding layer. Work shall
 not be discontinued within 18 inches of the top of any face unless provision has been made
 for a coping less than 18 inches thick. In this case, and if permitted by the Engineer, the
 construction joint may be made at the underside of the coping.
 
 Immediately following the discontinuance of placing concrete, all accumulations of mortar
 splashed on the reinforcement and the surface of forms shall be removed. Dried mortar
 chips and dust shall not be puddled into the unset concrete. If the accumulations are not
 removed prior to the concrete becoming set, care shall be exercised not to break or injure
 the concrete-steel bond at and near the surface of the concrete while cleaning the
 reinforcement. After initial set the forms shall not be jarred, and no strain shall be placed
 on the ends of projecting reinforcement until the concrete has sufficiently set to ensure
 against any damage by such jarring or strain.
 
 958
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 804.03.6.4--Placing Bridge Concrete. The method and sequence of placing concrete shall
 conform to the provisions and requirements set forth for the particular type of construction.
 804.03.6.4.1--Foundations and Substructures. Concrete seals shall be placed in
 accordance with Subsection 804.03.9. All other concrete for foundations shall be poured
 in the dry unless otherwise stipulated or authorization is given in writing by the Engineer
 to do otherwise. Concrete shall not be placed in foundations until the foundation area has
 been inspected and approved.
 
 Unless otherwise specified, the placement of concrete in the substructure shall be in
 accordance with the general requirements of Subsection 804.03.6.
 Unless otherwise directed, concrete in columns shall be placed in one continuous operation,
 and shall be allowed to set at least 12 hours before the caps are placed.
 804.03.6.4.2--Superstructure. For simple spans, concrete shall preferably be deposited
 by beginning at the center of the span and working toward the ends. For continuous spans,
 concrete shall be deposited as shown on the plans. Concrete in girders shall be uniformly
 deposited for the full length of the girder and brought up evenly in horizontal layers.
 Concrete in areas below the bridge deck but which is deposited at the same time as concrete
 for the bridge deck like a diaphragm, shall be placed and consolidated sufficiently ahead
 of placing the concrete for the bridge deck such that the placing, consolidating, finishing,
 and curing of concrete for the bridge deck shall not be impeded or slowed.
 
 Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, concrete shall not be placed in the
 superstructure until the column forms have been stripped sufficiently to determine the
 character of the concrete in the columns. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, the
 load of the superstructure shall not be placed on pile bents until the caps have been in place
 at least seven (7) days and shall not be placed on other types of bents until the bents have
 been in place at least 14 days.
 In placing concrete around steel shapes, it shall be placed on one side of the shape until it
 flushes up over the bottom flange of the shape on the opposite side, after which it shall be
 placed on both sides to completion.
 Concrete in girder haunches less than three feet (3’) in height shall be placed at the same
 time as that in the girder stem. Whenever a haunch or fillet has a height of three feet (3’)
 or more at the abutment or columns, the haunch and the girder shall be poured in three
 successive stages: (a) up to the lower side of the haunch; (2) to the lower side of the girder;
 and (3) to completion.
 Except when intermediate construction joints are specified, concrete in slab, T-beam, or
 deck-girder spans shall be placed in one continuous operation for each span.
 The floors and girders of through-girder superstructures shall be placed in one continuous
 operation unless otherwise specified, in which case special shear anchorage shall be
 provided to ensure monolithic action between girder and floor.
 Concrete in box girders shall be placed as shown on the plans.
 
 959
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 Concrete shall not be chuted directly into the forms of the span and shall be placed
 continuously with sufficient speed to be monolithic and to allow for finishing before initial
 set.
 804.03.6.4.3--Bridge Deck. When using the Transverse Method in accordance with
 Subsection 804.03.19.7.3, the period of time between concrete placement and completion
 of the final curing shall be kept to a minimum, as directed by the Engineer.
 804.03.7--Pneumatic Placing. Pneumatic placing of concrete will be permitted only if
 specified in the contract or if authorized by the Engineer. The equipment shall be so
 arranged that no vibrations result that might damage freshly placed concrete.
 
 Where concrete is conveyed and placed by pneumatic means, the equipment shall be
 suitable in kind and adequate in capacity for the work. The machine shall be located as
 close as practicable to the place of deposit. The position of the discharge end of the line
 shall not be more than 10 feet from the point of deposit. The discharge lines shall be
 horizontal or inclined upwards from the machine. At the conclusion of placement the entire
 equipment shall be thoroughly cleaned.
 804.03.8--Pumping Concrete. Placement of concrete by pumping will be permitted only
 if specified in the contract or if authorized in writing by the Engineer. If used, the
 equipment shall be arranged so that no vibrations result that might damage freshly placed
 concrete.
 
 Where concrete mixture is conveyed and placed by mechanically applied pressure
 (pumping), the equipment shall be suitable in kind and adequate in capacity for the work.
 The Contractor shall select concrete mixture proportions such that the concrete mixture is
 pumpable and placeable with the selected equipment.
 The pumping equipment shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to concrete placement. Excess
 form release agent shall be removed from the concrete pump hopper. The Contractor shall
 prime the pump at no additional cost to the Department by pumping and discarding enough
 concrete mixture to produce a uniform mixture exiting the pump. At least 0.25 cubic yard
 of concrete mixture shall be pumped and discarded to prime the pump. Only concrete
 mixture shall be added directly into the concrete pump hopper after placement has
 commenced. If anything other than concrete mixture is added to the concrete pump hopper,
 all concrete mixture in the concrete pump hopper and pump line shall be discarded and the
 pump re-primed at no additional cost to the Department.
 The discharge end of the pump shall be of such a configuration that the concrete does not
 move in the pump line under its own weight. The intent of this requirement is to ensure
 that entrained air in the concrete mixture remains entrained during pumping and depositing
 the concrete mixture. This shall be accomplished with one or both of the following:
 (a) a minimum 10-foot flexible hose attached to the discharge end of a steel reducer
 having a minimum length of three (3) feet and a minimum reduction in area of 20%
 which is attached to the discharge end of the pump line, or
 (b) a flexible reducing hose to the discharge end of the pumpline with a minimum
 reduction in area of 20% over a minimum 10-foot hose length.
 
 960
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 Regardless of the configuration chosen, the Contractor shall ensure that the concrete is
 pumped and does not free-fall more than five (5) feet within the entire length of pump line
 and after discharge from the end of pump line.
 The Contractor shall not have any type of metal elbow, metal pipe, or other metal fitting
 within five (5) feet of any person during discharge of concrete mixture.
 Boom pumps shall have a current Concrete Pump Manufacturers Association’s
 ASME/ANSI B30.27 certification. Equipment added to the boom and pump line shall meet
 the pump manufacturer’s specifications and shall not exceed the manufacturer’s maximum
 recommended weight limit for equipment added to the boom and pump line.
 The operation of the pump shall be such that a continuous stream of concrete without air
 pockets is produced. When pumping is completed, the concrete remaining in the pipe line,
 if it is to be used, shall be ejected in such a manner that there will be no contamination of
 the concrete or separation of the ingredients. After this operation, the entire equipment
 shall be thoroughly cleaned.
 The use of aluminum pipe as a conveyance for the concrete will not be permitted.
 804.03.9--Depositing Concrete Under Water. Concrete shall not be deposited in water
 except with the approval of the Engineer.
 
 Concrete deposited under water shall be Class S.
 Concrete deposited under water shall be carefully placed in a compact mass in its final
 position by means of a tremie, a bottom dump bucket, or other approved method and shall
 not be disturbed after being deposited. Special care shall be exercised to maintain still
 water at the point of deposit. No concrete shall be placed in running water and all form
 work designed to retain concrete under water shall be water-tight. The consistency of the
 concrete shall be carefully regulated, and special care shall be exercised to prevent
 segregation of materials.
 Concrete seals shall be placed continuously from start to finish, and the surface of the
 concrete shall be kept as nearly horizontal as practicable at all times. To ensure thorough
 bonding, each succeeding layer of a seal shall be placed before the preceding layer has
 taken initial set.
 When a tremie is used, it shall consist of a tube having a diameter of at least 10 inches and
 constructed in sections having flanged couplings fitted with gaskets. The means of
 supporting the tremie shall be such as to permit the free movement of the discharge over
 the entire top surface of the work and to permit it to be lowered rapidly when necessary to
 choke off or retard the flow of concrete. The discharge end shall be closed at the start of
 the work so as to prevent water entering the tube and shall be entirely sealed. The tremie
 tube shall be kept full to the bottom of the hopper. When a batch is dumped into the hopper,
 the flow of concrete shall be induced by slightly raising the discharge end, always keeping
 it in the deposited concrete. The flow is then stopped by lowering the tremie. The flow
 shall be continuous until the work is completed.
 Depositing of concrete by the drop bottom bucket method shall conform to the following:
 
 961
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 (a) The top of the bucket shall be open.
 (b) The bottom doors shall open freely downward and outward when tripped.
 (c) The bucket shall be completely filled and slowly lowered to avoid backwash. It
 shall not be dumped until it rests on the surface upon which the concrete is to be
 deposited and when discharged shall be withdrawn slowly until well above the
 concrete.
 Dewatering may proceed when the concrete seal is sufficiently hard and strong. As a
 general rule, this time will be 48 hours for concrete made with high-early-strength cement
 and three days for concrete made with other types of cement. All laitance and other
 unsatisfactory material shall be removed from the exposed surface by scraping, chipping,
 or other means that will not injure the surface of the concrete.
 804.03.10--Construction Joints.
 804.03.10.1--General. Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, construction joints
 shall be made only where located on the plans or shown in the pouring schedule. If not
 detailed on the plans, or in the case of emergency, construction joints shall be placed as
 directed by the Engineer. Shear keys or inclined reinforcement shall be used where
 necessary to transmit shear or to bond the two sections together.
 
 For continuous spans, bridge deck concrete shall be deposited as shown on the plans.
 Deviation from the pouring schedule shown in the plans is not permitted.
 804.03.10.2--Bonding. Before depositing new concrete on or against concrete that has
 hardened, the forms shall be retightened. The surface of the hardened concrete shall be
 roughened as required by the Engineer and in a manner that will not leave loosened
 particles of aggregate or damaged concrete at the surface. It shall be thoroughly cleaned
 of foreign matter and laitance and saturated with water. When directed by the Engineer,
 the cleaned and saturated surfaces, including vertical and inclined surfaces, shall first be
 thoroughly covered with a coating of mortar or neat cement grout against which the new
 concrete shall be placed before the grout has attained its initial set.
 
 The placing of concrete shall be carried continuously from joint to joint. The face edges
 of all joints that are exposed to view shall be carefully finished, true to line and elevation.
 In order to bond successive courses suitable depressed or raised keys of the designated size
 shall be constructed. Raised keys shall be monolithic with the concrete of the lower course.
 804.03.11--Concrete Exposed to Seawater. Unless otherwise specifically provided,
 concrete for structures exposed to seawater shall be Class AA concrete as referenced in
 Subsection 804.02.10. The clear distance from the face of the concrete to the nearest face
 of reinforcing steel shall be at least four inches. The mixing time and the water content
 shall be carefully controlled and regulated so as to produce concrete of maximum
 impermeability. The concrete shall be thoroughly compacted, and stone pockets shall be
 avoided. No construction joints shall be formed between the levels of extreme low water
 and extreme high water as determined by the Engineer. Between these levels, seawater
 shall not come in direct contact with the new concrete until at least 30 days have elapsed.
 The surface concrete as left by the forms shall be left undisturbed.
 804.03.12--Blank.

 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 804.03.13--Falsework. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer four copies of
 structural design analysis and detail drawings that show the method of falsework or
 centering. These designs and detail plans shall be prepared and bear the seal of a Registered
 Professional Engineer with experience in falsework design.
 
 Falsework plans shall include falsework elevations together with all other dimensions and
 details that are considered necessary for the construction. Other pertinent data needed is
 size and spacing of all falsework members and minimum bearing requirements for false
 piles.
 Upon completion of falsework erection, the Registered Professional Engineer shall certify
 that the erected falsework is capable of supporting the load for construction.
 Falsework piling shall be spaced and driven so that the bearing value of each pile is
 sufficient to support the load that will be imposed upon it. The bearing value of the piles
 should be calculated according to the appropriate formula given in Section 803.
 For designing falsework and centering, a weight of 150 pounds per cubic foot shall be
 assumed for green concrete. All falsework shall be designed and constructed to provide
 the necessary rigidity and to support the loads without appreciable settlement or
 deformation. The Contractor may be required to employ screw jacks or hardwood wedges
 to take up slight settlement in the falsework either before or during the placing of concrete.
 An allowance shall be made for anticipated compressibility of falsework and for the
 placement of shims, wedges, or jacks to produce the permanent structural camber shown
 on the plans. If during construction, any weakness develops and the falsework shows any
 undue settlement or distortion, the work shall be stopped, the part of the structure affected
 removed, and the falsework strengthened before work is resumed. Falsework that cannot
 be founded on a satisfactory footing shall be supported on piling, which shall be spaced,
 driven, and removed, as referenced in Subsection 804.03.15, in a manner approved by the
 Engineer.
 All structures built across a public street or highway on which maintenance of traffic is
 required, shall have falsework so arranged that a vertical clearance of at least 12' 6" is
 provided. Unless otherwise specified, a horizontal clearance of at least the width of the
 traveled way shall be provided at all times. If the vertical clearance is less than 13' 6" or
 the horizontal clearance is less than the full crown width of the roadway, the Contractor
 shall install and maintain appropriate safety devices, clearance signs and warning lights,
 and shall notify the Engineer sufficiently in advance of restricting the clearance for the
 Engineer to advise both the Traffic Engineering and the Maintenance Divisions. All traffic
 control and safety devices shall be in accordance with the MUTCD.
 804.03.14--Forms.
 804.03.14.1--General. Forms shall be wood, metal, or other material approved by the
 Engineer. All forms shall be built mortar-tight and sufficiently rigid to prevent distortion
 due to pressure of the concrete and other loads incident to the construction operations.
 Forms shall be constructed and maintained so as to prevent warping and the opening of
 joints due to shrinkage. The forms shall be substantial and unyielding and shall be so
 designed that the finished concrete will conform to the proper dimensions and contours.
 
 963
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 The design of the forms shall take into account the effect of vibration of concrete as it is
 placed.
 Minimum requirements for slab overhang forms shall be 3/4-inch plywood supported on
 2-inch x 6-inch S4S wood timbers placed flatwise on 16-inch centers.
 Adjustable brackets for support of slab overhang forms shall be spaced at a maximum
 distance of 3' 0" center to center unless specifically approved otherwise. Grade points for
 forms shall coincide with the location of the adjustable form brackets.
 Forms for surfaces exposed to view shall be of uniform thickness with a smooth inside
 surface of an approved type. Joints in forms for exposed surfaces shall be closely fitted to
 eliminate fins, stone pockets, or other variations in the surface of the concrete that would
 mar a smooth and uniform texture.
 Forms shall be filleted at all sharp corners and shall be given a bevel or draft in the case of
 all projections, such as girders and copings, to ensure easy removal.
 Metal ties or anchorages within the forms shall be so constructed as to permit their removal,
 without injury to the concrete, to a depth of at least the reinforcing steel clearance shown
 on the plans. In case ordinary wire ties are permitted, all wires, upon removal of the forms,
 shall be cut back at least 1/4 inch from the face of the concrete with chisels or nippers.
 Nippers shall be used for green concrete. All fittings for metal ties shall be designed so
 that upon their removal the cavities that are left will be the smallest practicable size. The
 cavities shall be filled with cement mortar and the surface left sound, smooth, even, and
 uniform in color.
 Forms shall be set and maintained to the lines designated until the concrete is sufficiently
 cured for form removal. Forms shall remain in place for periods determined as hereinafter
 specified. If forms are deemed to be unsatisfactory in any way, either before or during the
 placing of concrete, the Engineer will order the work stopped until the defects have been
 corrected.
 The shape, strength, rigidity, water-tightness, and surface smoothness of reused forms shall
 be maintained at all times. Warped or bulged lumber shall be resized before being reused.
 Forms that are unsatisfactory in any respect shall not be reused.
 Access to the lower portions of forms for narrow walls and columns shall be provided for
 cleaning out extraneous material immediately before placing the concrete.
 All forms shall be treated with an approved oil or saturated with water immediately before
 placing the concrete. For rail members or other members with exposed faces, the forms
 shall be treated only with an approved oil to prevent the adherence of concrete. Any
 material that will adhere to or discolor the concrete shall not be used.
 When metal forms are used they shall be kept free from rust, grease, or other foreign matter
 that will discolor the concrete. They shall be of sufficient thickness and so connected that
 they will remain true to shape and line, and shall conform in all respects as herein
 prescribed for mortar tightness, filleted corners, beveled projections, etc. They shall be
 constructed so as to ensure easy removal without injury to concrete. All inside bolt and
 rivet heads shall be countersunk.
 
 964
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 All chamfer strips shall be dressed, straight, and of uniform width and shall be maintained
 as such at all times.
 804.03.14.2--Stay-In-Place Metal Forms. Stay-in-place (SIP) metal forms are corrugated
 metal sheets permanently installed between the supporting superstructure members. After
 the concrete has cured, these forms shall remain in place as permanent, non-structural
 members of the bridge.
 
 Pay quantities for deck concrete will be computed from the dimensions shown in the
 contract plans with no allowance for changes in deflection and /or changes in dimensions
 necessary to accommodate the SIP metal forms.
 There will be no direct payment for the cost of the forms and form supports, or any material,
 tools, equipment, or labor incidental thereto, but the cost shall be considered absorbed in
 the contract unit price for concrete.
 Before fabricating any material, three (3) complete sets of SIP metal form shop drawings and
 design calculations, bearing the Design Engineer’s seal, shall be submitted to the Director of
 Structures, State Bridge Engineer, through the Engineer, for review. The Contractor’s SIP
 metal form Design Engineer shall be a Mississippi Registered Professional Engineer who is
 knowledgeable in the field of structural design.
 In no case shall additional dead load produced by the use of SIP metal forms overstress any
 bridge component. Design calculations shall indicate any additional dead load from SIP
 metal form self-weight, form support hangers, concrete in flutes, concrete due to form
 deflection, etc., that are not included in the plans. The additional dead loads shall be clearly
 labeled and tabulated on the shop drawings. Bridge Division will evaluate the additional
 load for overstress of the bridge components. In the event that the additional dead load
 produces an overstress in any bridge component, Bridge Division will reject the
 Contractor’s design. Deflection and loads produced by deflection of the SIP metal forms
 shall be considered and indicated in the design calculations.
 The cambers and deflections provided in the plans do not consider the effects of SIP metal
 forms. The Contractor’s Engineer shall take into account the weight of the forms and any
 additional dead load when developing the “Bridge Superstructure Construction Plan”.
 For the purpose of reducing any additional dead load produced by the SIP metal forms, the
 flutes of SIP metal forms may be filled with polystyrene foam. When polystyrene foam is
 used to fill the forms, the form flutes shall be filled completely. No portion of the
 polystyrene foam shall extend beyond the limits of the flutes. The Contractor shall ensure
 that the polystyrene foam remains in its required position within flutes during the entire
 concrete placement process. The Contractor shall not use reinforcing steel supports or
 other accessories in such a manner as to cause damage to the polystyrene foam. All
 damaged polystyrene foam shall be replaced to the satisfaction of the Engineer. All
 welding of formwork shall be completed prior to placement of polystyrene foam.
 For bridges not located in horizontal curves, the Contractor may reduce the additional dead
 load by matching the flute spacing with the transverse steel spacing of the bottom layer.
 The bottom longitudinal layer of steel shall have one (1) inch of minimum concrete cover
 measured from the bottom of the reinforcing to the top of the flute. The Contractor will
 
 965
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 not be allowed to vary the reinforcing steel spacing or size from the plans for the purpose
 of matching flute spacing.
 804.03.14.2.1--Materials. SIP metal forms and supports shall meet the requirements of
 ASTM A653 having a coating designation G165. Form materials that are less than 0.03inch uncoated thickness shall not be allowed.
 804.03.14.2.2--Certification. The Contractor shall provide written certification from the
 manufacturer stating that the product meets the requirements of this specification to the
 Engineer along with the delivery of the coated forms to the job site.
 804.03.14.2.3--Polystyrene Foam. The polystyrene foam shall be comprised of expanded
 polystyrene manufactured from virgin resin of sufficient density to support the weight of
 concrete without deformation. The polystyrene foam shall be extruded to match the
 geometry of the flutes and provide a snug fit. The polystyrene foam shall have a density
 of not less than 0.8 pounds per cubic foot. The polystyrene foam shall have water
 absorption of less than 2.6% when tested according to ASTM C272. The Contractor shall
 provide written certification from the manufacturer stating the polystyrene foam product
 meets the requirements of this specification to the Engineer along with the delivery of the
 coated forms to the job site.
 804.03.14.2.4--Design. The design of the SIP metal forms shall meet the following criteria.
 
 (a) The maximum self-weight of the stay in place metal forms, plus the weight of the
 concrete or expanded polystyrene required to fill the form flutes (where used), shall
 not exceed 20 psf.
 (b) The forms shall be designed on the basis of dead load of form, reinforcement, and
 plastic concrete plus 50 pounds per square foot for construction loads. The design
 shall use a unit working stress in the steel sheet of not more than 0.725 of the
 specified minimum yield strength of the material furnished, but not to exceed 36,000
 psi.
 (c) Deflection under the weight of the forms, reinforcement, and plastic concrete shall
 not exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2 inch, whichever is less, for form spans of
 10 feet or less, or 1/240 of the form span or 3/4 inch, whichever is less, for form
 spans greater than 10 feet.
 (d) The design span of the form shall equal the clear span of the form plus two (2)
 inches. The span shall be measure parallel to the form flutes.
 (e) Physical design properties shall be computed in accordance with requirements of
 the AISI Specifications for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members,
 latest published edition.
 (f) The design concrete cover required by the plans shall be maintained for all
 reinforcement.
 (g) The plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck reinforcement from the top
 surface of the concrete deck shall be maintained.
 (h) The SIP metal form shall not be considered as lateral bracing for compression
 flanges of supporting structural members.
 (i) SIP metal forms shall not be used under closure pours or in bays where longitudinal
 slab construction joints are located. SIP metal forms shall not be used under
 cantilevered slabs such as the overhang outside of fascia members.
 (j) Forms shall be secured to the supporting members by means other than welding
 directly to the member. Welding to the top flanges of steel stringers and/or girders
 
 966
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 shall not be allowed. Alternate installation procedures shall be submitted addressing
 this condition.
 804.03.14.2.5--Construction. SIP metal form sheets shall not rest directly on the top of
 the stringer of floor beam flanges. Sheets shall be fastened securely to form supports, and
 maintain a minimum bearing length of one (1) inch at each end for metal forms. Form
 supports shall be placed in direct contact with the flange of the stringer or floor beam. All
 attachments for coated metal forms shall be made by bolts, clips, screws, or other approved
 means.
 804.03.14.2.6--Form Galvanizing Repairs. Where forms or their installation are
 unsatisfactory in the opinion of the Engineer, either before or during placement of the concrete,
 the Contractor shall correct the defects before proceeding with the construction work. The
 cost of such corrective work shall be at the sole expense of the Contractor. Minor heat
 discoloration in areas of welds shall not be touched up.
 804.03.14.2.7--Concrete. The Contractor shall ensure concrete placement does not
 damage the SIP metal forms. Approved pouring sequences shall be used. The completed
 SIP metal form system shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar or concrete. The
 concrete shall be consolidated to avoid honeycomb and voids, especially at construction
 joints, expansion joints, valleys, and ends of form sheets. Calcium chloride or any other
 admixture containing chloride salts shall not be used in the concrete.
 804.03.14.2.8--Inspection. The Engineer will observe the Contractor’s method of
 construction during all phases of the construction of the bridge deck slab, including the
 installation of the SIP metal form system, location and fastening of the reinforcement,
 composition of concrete items, mixing procedures, concrete placement, and vibration, and
 finishing of the bridge deck. Should the Engineer determine that the procedures used
 during the placement of the concrete warrant inspection of the underside of the deck, at
 least one section of the metal forms shall be removed in each span for this purpose. This
 shall be done as soon after placing the concrete as practical in order to provide visual
 evidence that the concrete mix and the procedures are obtaining the desired results. An
 additional section shall be removed in any span if the Engineer determines that there has
 been any change in the concrete mix or in the procedures warranting additional inspection.
 
 If, in the Engineer’s judgment, inspection is needed to check for defects in the bottom of
 the deck or to verify soundness, the SIP metal forms shall be sounded with a hammer after
 the deck concrete has been in place a minimum of two days. If sounding discloses areas
 of doubtful soundness to the Engineer, the SIP metal forms shall be removed from such
 areas for visual inspection after the concrete has attained adequate strength. The SIP metal
 bridge deck forms shall be removed at no expense to the State.
 At locations where sections of the metal forms have been removed, the Engineer will not
 require the Contractor to replace the metal forms. The adjacent metal forms and supports
 shall be repaired to present a neat appearance and to ensure their satisfactory retention. As
 soon as the form is removed, the Engineer will examine the concrete surfaces for cavities,
 honeycombing, and other defects. If irregularities are found and the Engineer determines
 that these irregularities do not justify rejection of the work, the concrete shall be repaired
 as directed by the Engineer. If the Engineer determines that the concrete where the form
 is removed is unsatisfactory, additional metal forms as necessary shall be removed to
 inspect and repair the slab, and the Contractor’s method of construction shall be modified
 
 967
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the slab. All unsatisfactory concrete shall be
 removed and replaced as directed at no expense to the State.
 If the method of construction and the results of the inspections as outlined above indicate
 that sound concrete has been obtained throughout the slabs, the amount of sounding and
 form removal may be reduced when approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide a safe and convenient means of conducting the inspection.
 804.03.15--Removal of Falsework, Forms, and Housing. In the determination of the
 time for the removal of falsework, forms and housing and the discontinuance of heating,
 consideration shall be given to the location and character of the structure, the weather and
 other conditions influencing the setting of the concrete, and the materials used in the mix.
 No forms or supports shall be removed prior to approval by the Engineer. During cold
 weather, removal of housing and the discontinuance of heating shall be in accordance with
 Subsection 804.03.16.1.
 
 Concrete in the last pour of a continuous superstructure shall have attained a compressive
 strength of 2,400 psi, as determined by cylinder tests or maturity meter probe, prior to
 striking any falsework. It is important that falsework be removed as evenly as possible to
 prevent excessive deflection stresses in the spans.
 At the Contractor's option and with the approval of the Engineer, the time for removal of
 forms may be determined by cylinder tests, in accordance with the requirements listed in
 Table 6, in which case the Contractor shall furnish facilities for testing the cylinders. The
 facilities shall include an approved concrete testing machine of sufficient capacity and
 calibrated by an acceptable commercial laboratory. Tests shall be conducted in the
 presence of a Department representative to witness and record strengths obtained on each
 break or performed by a Department certified technician in an approved testing laboratory.
 The cylinders shall be cured under conditions that are not more favorable than those
 existing for the portions of the structure that they represent.

 For bridges, non-SIP metal forms for bridge deck slabs overhead and bridge deck slabs
 between beams shall be removed with the approval of the Engineer, between two weeks
 and four weeks after the removal of the wet burlap applied in accordance with Subsection
 804.03.17.1, or the application of liquid membrane applied in accordance with Subsection
 804.03.17.2.
 In lieu of using concrete strength cylinders to determine when falsework, forms, and
 housings can be removed, an approved maturity meter may be used to determine concrete
 strengths by inserting probes into concrete placed in a structure. The minimum number of
 maturity meter probes required for each structural component shall be in accordance with
 Table 7. Falsework, forms, and housings may be removed when maturity meter readings
 indicate that the required concrete strength is achieved. Procedures for using the maturity
 meter and developing the strength/maturity relationship shall follow the requirements of
 AASHTO T 325 and ASTM C 1074 specifications. Technicians using the maturity meter
 or calculating strength/maturity graphs shall be required to have at least two hours of
 training prior to using the maturity equipment.

 Methods of form removal likely to cause overstressing of the concrete shall not be used.
 Forms and supports shall be removed in a manner that will permit the concrete to uniformly
 and gradually take the stresses due to its own weight. Centers shall be gradually and
 uniformly lowered in a manner that will avoid injurious stresses in any part of the structure.
 As soon as concrete for railings, ornamental work, parapets and vertical faces that require
 a rubbed finish has attained a safe strength, the forms shall be carefully removed without
 marring the surfaces and corners, the required finishing performed, and the required curing
 continued.
 Prior to final inspection of the work, the Contractor shall remove all falsework, forms,
 excavated material or other material placed in the stream channel during construction.
 Falsework piles may be cut or broken off at least one foot below the mudline or ground
 line unless the plans specifically indicate that they are to be pulled and completely removed
 from the channel.

 Section 804
 
 804.03.16--Cold or Hot Weather Concreting.
 804.03.16.1--Cold Weather Concreting. In cold weather, the temperature of the concrete
 when delivered to the job site shall conform to the temperature limitations of “Temperature
 Limitations on Concrete when Delivered to Job Site” listed in Table 8 below. Cold weather
 is defined as three consecutive days when there is a probability that the daily average of
 the highest and lowest ambient temperatures is expected to be less than 40°F. This threeday forecast shall be based on the latest information available from the National Weather
 Service.
 
 When the Contractor proposes to place concrete during seasons when there is a probability
 of ambient temperatures lower than 40°F, the Contractor shall have available on the project
 the approved facilities necessary to enclose uncured concrete and to keep the temperature
 of the air inside the enclosure within the ranges and for the minimum periods specified
 herein.
 When there are indications of temperatures of less than 40°F during the first four days after
 placement of the concrete, the concrete shall be protected from cold temperatures by
 maintaining a temperature between 50°F and 100°F for at least four days after placement
 and between 40°F and 100°F for at least three additional days. The Contractor shall use
 such heating equipment such as stoves, salamanders, or steam equipment as deemed
 necessary to protect the concrete. When dry heat is used, means of maintaining
 atmospheric moisture shall be provided.
 At the option of the Contractor with the approval of the Engineer, when concrete is placed
 during cold weather and there is a probability of ambient temperatures lower than 40°F, an
 approved maturity meter may be used to determine concrete strengths by inserting probes
 into concrete placed in a structure. The minimum number of maturity meter probes
 required for each structural component shall be in accordance with Table 7. An approved
 insulating blanketing material shall be used to protect the work when ambient temperatures
 are less than 40°F and shall remain in place until the required concrete strength in Table 6
 is achieved. Procedures for using the maturity meter and developing the strength/maturity
 relationship shall follow the requirements of AASHTO T 325 and ASTM C 1074
 specifications. Technicians using the maturity meter or calculating strength/maturity
 graphs shall be required to have at least two hours of training prior to using the maturity
 equipment.
 One or more of the aggregates and/or mixing water may be heated. The aggregates may
 be heated by steam, dry heat, or by placing in the mixing water that has been heated. Frozen
 aggregates shall not be used. When either aggregates or water are heated above 100°F, the
 aggregates and water shall be combined first in the mixer before the cement is added to
 avoid flash set. Cement shall not be mixed with water or with a mixture of water and
 aggregate having a temperature greater than 100°F.
 The use of salt or other chemical admixtures in lieu of heating will not be permitted.
 Before placing concrete, all ice or frost shall be removed from the forms and reinforcement.
 
 970
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 In the case of concrete placed directly on or in the ground, such as for footings or bottom
 slabs, protection and curing during cold weather may be provided as set for concrete
 pavement under Subsection 501.03.20.3.
 The Contractor shall assume all risk and added cost connected with the placing and
 protecting of concrete during cold weather. Permission given by the Engineer to place
 concrete during such time will in no way relieve the Contractor of responsibility for
 satisfactory results. Should it be determined at any time that the concrete placed under
 such conditions is unsatisfactory, it shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory
 concrete by the Contractor without extra compensation.

 804.03.16.2--Hot Weather Concreting. The manufacture, placement, and protection of
 concrete during hot weather requires special attention to ensure that uniform slump ranges
 and satisfactory placement qualities are maintained, that surface cracking is held to a
 minimum, and that design strengths are produced.
 
 For bridge decks when the ambient temperature is above 90°F, the forms, reinforcing steel,
 steel beam flanges, and other surfaces which will come in contact with the concrete shall
 be cooled to below 90°F by means of a water spray or other approved methods.
 Additionally, when the atmospheric temperature is predicted to be 90°F or above based on
 the latest information available from the National Weather Service any time during the day
 of placement or day after placement, the time of placement shall not begin until 5:00 p.m.
 on the day of placement and shall be completed by 6:00 a.m. the following day.
 804.03.17--Curing Concrete. Curing is defined as all actions taken to ensure the moisture
 and temperature conditions of freshly placed concrete exist so the concrete may develop
 strength and result in a long lasting, durable, structural member. Curing shall take place
 from the time of placement until the developed strength is such that the concrete is not
 damaged by rapid drying or temperature gradients. The Contractor shall use the guidance
 in ACI 308R-01 to:
 
 (a) cure the concrete in such a manner as to prevent premature moisture loss from the
 concrete,
 (b) supply additional moisture to the concrete as required in order to ensure sufficient
 moisture within the concrete, and
 (c) maintain a concrete temperature beneficial to the concrete.
 Curing in accordance with the requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.1 or Subsection
 804.03.17.2 shall be established within 20 minutes after finishing, except as noted for
 
 971
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 bridge decks. Finishing is considered to be complete when the pan drag, burlap drag, or
 other finishing methods are complete.
 The required method of curing for bridge deck concrete is dependent on the method of
 strike-off, the type of formwork used, and whether or not lightweight aggregate (LWA) is
 used for internal curing. The required method of curing for each alternative is as follows:
 (a) When removable forms are used, the bridge deck concrete may be cured in
 accordance with Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With Waterproof Cover or
 Subsection 804.03.17.2 - Liquid Membrane.
 (b) When stay-in-place (SIP) metal forms are used in conjunction with the Transverse
 Method of strike-off, the bridge deck concrete shall be cured in accordance with
 Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With Waterproof Cover. See Subsections
 804.03.14.2 - Stay-In-Place Metal Forms and 804.03.19.7.3 - Transverse Method.
 (c) When the Longitudinal Method or the Transverse Method of strike-off is used for
 repairs to bridge decks or bridge widening, the bridge deck concrete may be cured
 in accordance with Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With Waterproof Cover or
 Subsection 804.03.17.2 - Liquid Membrane. Additionally, the time in which the
 curing is applied to the bridge deck surface may be increased to 30 minutes after
 finishing due to the nature of the work.
 When the bridge deck concrete contains LWA meeting the requirements of Subsection
 703.19.2 and the mixture contains an internal curing water content of 8.0 pounds or greater
 per 100 pounds of total cementitious materials, the bridge deck concrete may be cured in
 accordance with Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With Waterproof Cover or Subsection
 804.03.17.2 - Liquid Membrane.
 The length of time for curing shall be maintained on the bridge deck surface in accordance
 with either of the following:
 (a) Prescribed Length of Time:
 1. Curing following the requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With
 Waterproof Cover shall continue uninterrupted for at least 17 days. This
 includes a 10-day period in which the concrete is kept wet continually through
 the use of wet burlap, soaker hoses, and white polyethylene sheets.
 Immediately following is a 7-day period in which a single layer of liquid
 membrane is applied to allow the concrete to dry slowly. For bridge decks,
 construction traffic may utilize the deck during the 7-day drying period, but the
 Contractor is required to immediately reapply liquid membrane to any marred
 surfaces.
 2. Curing following the requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.2 - Liquid
 Membrane shall continue uninterrupted for at least 10 days.
 (b) Length of Time Defined by Development of Compressive Strength:
 Curing following the application requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.1 or
 Subsection 804.03.17.2 shall continue uninterrupted for concrete within an
 individual pour until the compressive strength of the concrete exceeds 75% of the 28day compressive strength submitted as the Basis of Proportioning per Subsection
 804.02.10.1.
 
 972
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 If cured following the requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.1 - Water With
 Waterproof Cover, once the concrete achieves 75% of the 28-day compressive the
 polyethylene sheeting and wet burlap may be removed and a single layer of liquid
 membrane applied. For bridge decks, construction traffic may utilize the deck
 during the 7-day drying period but the Contractor is required to immediately reapply
 liquid membrane to any marred surfaces.
 804.03.17.1--Water with Waterproof Cover. All burlap shall be completely saturated and
 wet prior to placing it on the concrete. The burlap shall have been fully soaked in water for
 a minimum of 12 hours prior to placement on the concrete.
 
 For bridge decks, the Contractor shall apply one (1) layer of saturated burlap within 20
 minutes of the initial strike-off for bridges without a skew and 25 minutes of the initial strikeoff for bridges with a skew. For all other concrete, the Contractor shall apply one (1) layer
 of saturated burlap within 20 minutes of completing finishing.
 For bridge decks, following the first layer of burlap, the Contractor shall apply a second layer
 of saturated burlap within five (5) minutes of applying the first layer.
 The applied burlap shall completely cover all exposed concrete surfaces. In areas where the
 burlap may not be directly applied due to the concrete surface, for example, in areas where
 reinforcing steel protrudes thru the concrete surface, like in the areas of a bridge deck where
 the bridge railing will be constructed at a later time, the saturated burlap shall be draped over
 the steel. The concrete surface shall not be allowed to dry after strike-off or at any time during
 the curing period.
 The Contractor shall maintain the burlap in a fully wet condition using powered fogging
 equipment capable of producing a fog spray of atomized droplets of water until the concrete
 has gained sufficient strength to allow foot traffic without the foot traffic marring the surface
 of the concrete. Burlap shall not be maintained in the fully wet condition using equipment
 that does not produce a fog spray of atomized droplets of water or by use of manually
 pressurized sprayers.
 For bridge decks, once the concrete has gained sufficient strength to allow foot traffic that
 does not mar the surface of the concrete, soaker hoses shall be placed on the burlap. The
 soaker hoses shall then be supplied with running water continuously to maintain continuous
 saturation of all burlap and the entire concrete surface.
 If there is a delay in the placement of the first layer of saturated burlap outside the time limit,
 the struck-off and finished concrete shall be kept wet by use of the powered fogging
 equipment used to keep the burlap wet.
 White polyethylene sheets shall be placed on top of the wet burlap and, as applicable, soaker
 hoses, covering the entire concrete surface as soon as practical and not more than 12 hours
 after the placement of the concrete. White polyethylene sheets of the widest practical width
 shall be used, overlapping adjacent sheets a minimum of six inches (6”) and tightly sealed
 with an adhesive like pressure sensitive tape, mastic, glue, or other approved methods to form
 a complete waterproof cover of the entire concrete surface. White polyethylene sheets that
 overlap a minimum of two feet (2’) may be held in place using means other than an adhesive.
 The white polyethylene sheets shall be secured so that wind will not displace them. The
 
 973
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 Contractor shall immediately repair the broken or damaged portions or replace sections that
 have lost their waterproof qualities.
 If burlap and/or white polyethylene sheets are temporarily removed for any reason during the
 curing period, the Contractor shall keep the entire exposed area continuously wet. The
 saturated burlap and white polyethylene sheets shall be replaced, resuming the specified
 curing conditions, as soon as possible.
 The Contractor shall inspect the bridge deck surface once every eight (8) hours for the entirety
 of the curing period, so that all areas remain wet for the entire curing period and all curing
 requirements are satisfied and document the inspection in accordance with Subsection
 804.03.17.1.1.
 At the end of the curing period, one coating of liquid membrane shall be applied following
 the requirements of Subsection 804.03.17.1.2. The purpose of the coating of liquid
 membrane is to allow for slow drying of the concrete. The application of liquid membrane
 to any area shall be complete within 30 minutes of the beginning of removal of the white
 polyethylene sheets, soaker hoses, and burlap from this area.
 804.03.17.1.1--Documentation for Bridge Decks.
 Engineer with a daily inspection report that includes:
 
 The Contractor shall provide the
 
 (a) documentation that identifies any deficiencies found (including location of
 deficiency);
 (b) documentation of corrective measures taken;
 (c) a statement of certification that all areas are wet and all curing material is in place on
 the entire bridge deck;
 (d) documentation showing the time and date of all inspections and the inspector’s
 signature; and
 (e) documentation of any temporary removal of curing materials including location, date
 and time, length of time curing was removed, and means taken to ensure exposed area
 was kept continuously wet.
 804.03.17.1.2--Liquid Membrane. At the end of the 14-day wet curing period the wet
 burlap and polyethylene sheets shall be removed and within 30 minutes, the Contractor shall
 apply white liquid membrane to the deck. The liquid membrane shall be thoroughly mixed
 within the time recommended by the liquid membrane producer but no more than an hour
 before use. If the use of liquid membrane results in a streaked or blotched appearance, the
 method shall be stopped and water curing applied until the cause of defective appearance
 is corrected.
 
 The liquid membrane shall be applied when no free water remains on the surface but while
 the surface is still wet. The liquid membrane shall be applied according to the
 manufacturer’s instructions with a minimum spreading rate per coat of one (1) gallon per
 200 square feet of concrete surface. If the concrete is dry or becomes dry, the Contractor
 shall thoroughly wet it with water applied as a fog spray by means of approved equipment.
 The application of liquid membrane shall be accomplished by the use of power applied
 spray equipment using nozzles and other equipment recommended by the liquid membrane
 producer. Manually pressurized or manual pump-up type sprayers shall not be used to
 apply the first application of liquid membrane.
 
 974
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 As a visual guide, the color of concrete covered with the required amount of liquid
 membrane should be indistinguishable from a sheet of commercially available standard
 “letter” size white copier paper placed on top of it when viewed from a distance of about
 five feet (5’) away horizontally if standing on the same grade as the concrete. The
 appearance of the concrete does not supersede applying the minimum spreading rate.
 The coating shall be protected against marring for at least seven (7) days after the
 application of the curing compound. The coating on bridge decks shall receive extra
 attention and may require additional protection as required by the Engineer. All membrane
 marred or otherwise disturbed shall be given an additional coating. Manually pressurized
 or manual pump-up type sprayers may be used for giving marred areas the required
 additional application of liquid membrane. Should the surface coating be subjected
 repeatedly to injury, the Engineer may require that the water curing method be applied at
 once.
 The 7-day period during which the liquid membrane is applied and protected shall not be
 reduced even if the period of wet curing is extended past the required 14 days.
 804.03.17.1.2.1--Liquid Membrane Documentation. The Contractor shall make available
 to the Engineer an application rate verification method and any information necessary
 during application of the liquid membrane to verify that the rate of application meets the
 prescribed rate for the various surfaces of the concrete, including, but not limited to, the
 top surface of the bridge deck and exposed sides of the bridge deck after any forms are
 removed. The Contractor shall submit this application verification method to the Engineer
 in accordance with Subsection 804.02.12.1.1.
 
 One method of verifying the rate of application is as follows:
 (a) Determine the volume of liquid membrane in the container. For a container with a
 uniform cross-sectional area, for example a 55-gallon drum, determine the area of
 the cross-section. Determine the height of the surface of the liquid membrane from
 the bottom of the container. This may be accomplished by inserting a sufficiently
 long, clean dip-stick parallel with the axis of the container into the liquid membrane
 until the inserted end of the dip-stick contacts the bottom of the container. On
 removing the dip-stick, measure the length from the end that was inserted to the
 point on the dip-stick where the liquid membrane ceases to coat the dip-stick.
 Multiply the area of the cross-section by the height of the level of liquid membrane,
 maintaining consistent units, to determine the volume.
 (b) Perform step 1 prior to beginning application of the liquid membrane to establish
 the initial volume.
 (c) During the period of application, perform step 1 each 100 square feet of bridge deck.
 (d) In order to meet the required application rate of one (1) gallon per 200 square feet,
 the amount in the container shall be at least 0.5 gallon less than the previous volume
 in the previous 100 square feet. Other changes in volume may apply depending on
 the manufacturer’s recommended application rate.
 (e) Additional applications to an area shall be applied until the required rate is satisfied.
 Areas that are not visually satisfactory to the Engineer shall have additional liquid
 membrane applied as directed by the Engineer.

 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 The amount of liquid membrane applied shall be determined each day using the application
 verification method. This information shall be submitted to the Engineer within 24 hours
 of applying the liquid membrane.
 804.03.17.2--Liquid Membrane Method. All surfaces on which curing is to be by liquid
 membrane shall be given the required surface finish prior to the application of liquid
 membrane. Concrete surfaces cured by liquid membrane shall receive two applications of
 white liquid membrane. Neither application shall be made from a position supported by or
 in contact with the freshly placed concrete. Both applications shall be applied
 perpendicularly to the surface of the concrete.
 
 When using liquid membrane, the liquid membrane shall be thoroughly mixed within the
 time recommended by the liquid membrane producer but no more than an hour before use.
 If the use of liquid membrane results in a streaked or blotched appearance, the method shall
 be stopped and water curing applied until the cause of defective appearance is corrected.
 The application of liquid membrane shall be accomplished by the use of power applied
 spray equipment using nozzles and other equipment recommended by the liquid membrane
 producer. Manually pressurized or manual pump-up type sprayers shall not be used to
 apply the first two applications of liquid membrane.
 The liquid membrane shall be applied when no free water remains on the surface but while
 the surface is still wet. The liquid membrane shall be applied according to the
 manufacturer’s instructions with a minimum spreading rate per coat of one (1) gallon per
 200 square feet of concrete surface. If the concrete is dry or becomes dry, the Contractor
 shall thoroughly wet it with water applied as a fog spray by means of approved equipment.
 The first application of the liquid membrane shall be made as the work progresses. For
 bridge decks, the first application shall be completed in each area of the deck, including
 the area in which the bridge railing will be later constructed, within 20 minutes of initial
 strike-off for bridges with no skew and within 25 minutes of initial strike-off for bridges
 with skew. For all other concrete, the first application of the liquid membrane shall be
 completed within 20 minutes of finishing.
 The second application shall be applied within 30 minutes after the first application. The
 liquid membrane shall be uniformly applied to all exposed concrete surfaces.
 As a visual guide, the color of concrete covered with the required amount of liquid
 membrane should be indistinguishable from a sheet of commercially available standard
 “letter” size white copier paper placed on top of it when viewed from a distance of about
 five feet (5’) away horizontally if standing on the same grade as the concrete. The
 appearance of the concrete does not supersede applying the minimum spreading rate.
 The Contractor shall make available to the Engineer an application rate verification in
 accordance with Subsection 804.03.17.1.2.1.
 The coating shall be protected against marring for at least 10 days after the application of
 the curing compound. The coating on bridge decks shall receive extra attention and may
 require additional protection as required by the Engineer. All membrane marred or
 otherwise disturbed shall be given an additional coating. Manually pressurized or manual
 pump-up type sprayers may be used for giving marred areas the required additional
 
 976
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 application of liquid membrane. Should the surface coating be subjected repeatedly to
 injury, the Engineer may require that the water curing method be applied at once.
 After the specified time for curing, but prior to constructing the bridge railing, all liquid
 membrane shall be removed from both the exposed surfaces of the reinforcing steel and
 the concrete surfaces on which bridge rail will be constructed. This removal of liquid
 membrane may be accomplish by high pressure washing or other methods approved by the
 Engineer.
 804.03.18--Expansion and Fixed Joints, Bearings, Anchor Bolts, Plates, Castings,
 Pipes, Drains, Conduits, Etc. All joints shall be constructed according to details shown
 on the plans. The edges of the concrete at open or filled joints shall be chamfered or edged
 as indicated on the plans.
 804.03.18.1--Open Joints. Open joints shall be placed in the locations shown on the plans
 and shall be constructed by the insertion and subsequent removal of a wood strip, metal
 plate, or other approved material. The insertion and removal of the template shall be
 accomplished without chipping or breaking the corners of the concrete. Reinforcement
 shall not extend across an open joint unless so specified on the plans.
 804.03.18.2--Filled Joints. Poured expansion joints and joints to be sealed with premolded
 materials shall be constructed similar to open joints. When premolded types are specified,
 the filler shall be placed in correct position as the concrete on one side of the joint is placed.
 When the form is removed, the concrete on the other side shall be placed. Adequate water
 stops of metal, rubber, or plastic shall be carefully placed as shown on the plans.
 804.03.18.3--Premolded and Preformed Joint Seals. When preformed elastomeric
 compressive joint seals are specified, the previously formed and cured open joint shall be
 thoroughly cleaned of all foreign matter, the required adhesive uniformly applied, and the
 seal installed in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer of the seal.
 
 When premolded filler is used for the joints in the roadway slab, the tops shall be
 adequately sealed with poured joint filler in accordance with details on the plans.
 Premolded filler shall be permanently fastened to an adjacent concrete surface by
 appropriate use of copper wire, copper nails, or galvanized nails.
 804.03.18.4--Steel Joints. The plates, angles, or other structural shapes shall be accurately
 shaped at the shop to conform to the section of the concrete floor. Fabrication and painting
 shall conform to the specifications covering those items. When called for on the plans or
 in the special provisions, the material shall be galvanized in lieu of painting. Care shall be
 taken to ensure that the surface in the finished plane is true and free of warping. Positive
 methods shall be employed in placing the joints to keep them in correct position during the
 placing of the concrete. The opening at expansion joints shall be that designated on the
 plans at normal temperature, and care shall be taken to avoid impairment of the clearance
 in any manner.
 804.03.18.5--Water Stops. Adequate water stops of metal, rubber, or plastic shall be
 placed as shown on the plans. Where movement at the joint is provided for, the water stops
 shall be of a type permitting movement without injury. They shall be spliced, welded, or
 soldered to form continuous watertight joints.

 804.03.18.6--Bearing Devices. Bearing plates, rockers, and other bearing devices shall be
 constructed according to details shown on the plans. Unless otherwise specified or set in
 plastic concrete, they shall be set in grout to ensure uniform bearing. Structural steel and
 painting shall conform to the requirements of Sections 810 and 814. When specified, the
 material shall be galvanized in lieu of painting. The rockers or other expansion bearing
 devices shall be set, considering the temperature at the time of erection, so that the required
 position of the device is provided.
 
 At all points of bearing contact, concrete members shall be separated from underlying
 members by dimensioned bearing pads or by methods and/or materials specified on the
 plans.
 When not otherwise specifically provided, contact areas between concrete super-structures
 and substructures shall be separated by three layers of No. 15, Type I, roofing felt.
 804.03.18.7--Friction Joints. Metal friction joints shall consist of plates as indicated on
 the plans and shall be securely anchored in correct position. All sliding surfaces shall be
 thoroughly coated with an approved graphite grease. Movement shall not be impeded by
 the concrete in which the plates are embedded.
 804.03.18.8--Placing Anchor Bolts, Plates, Castings, Grillage, Conduits, Etc. All
 anchor bolts, plates, castings, grillage, conduits, etc. indicated on the plans to be placed in
 or on the concrete shall be placed, set, or embedded as indicated or as directed. These
 items of the construction shall be set in hydraulic cement mortar as referenced in
 Subsection 714.11.5, except that anchor bolts may, as permitted by the Engineer, be built
 into the masonry, set in drilled holes, or placed as the concrete is being constructed by
 inserting encasing pipe or oiled wooden forms of sufficient size to allow for adjustment of
 the bolts. After removal of the pipe or forms, the space around the bolts shall be filled with
 hydraulic cement mortar completely filling the holes. The bolt shall be set accurately and
 perpendicular to the plane of the seat.
 
 Anchor bolts to be set in the masonry prior to the erection of the superstructure shall be
 carefully set to proper location and elevation with a template or by other suitable means.
 When bed plates are set in mortar, no superstructure or other load shall be placed thereon
 until this mortar has been allowed to set for a period of at least 96 hours, subject to the
 restrictions for cold weather concreting in Subsection 804.03.16.1. The mortar shall be
 kept well moistened during this period.
 Weep hole drains shall be installed in abutments and retaining walls, and roadway drains
 or scuppers shall be installed in the roadway slabs in accordance with the details shown on
 the plans.
 Where backfill is to be made at weep holes or openings in the structure, sand or stone
 chimneys or French drains shall be constructed as specified and shall extend through the
 portion of the backfill to be drained. Except as otherwise provided, the sand, stone, or slag
 used in this construction shall meet the requirements of Subsection 704.04.
 804.03.19--Finishing Concrete Surfaces.

 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 804.03.19.1--Classes of Finishes. Surface finishes of exposed concrete surfaces shall be
 classified as follows:
 
 Class 1 - Ordinary Surface Finish
 Class 2 - Rubbed or spray Finish
 Class 3 - Tooled Finish
 Class 4 - Sand-Blast Finish
 Class 5 - Wirebrush or Scrubbed Finish
 Class 6 - Floated Surface Finish
 804.03.19.2--Class 1, Ordinary Surface Finish. Immediately following the removal of
 forms, all fins and irregular projections shall be removed from all surfaces except from
 those that are not to be exposed or not to be waterproofed. On all surfaces, the cavities
 produced by form ties and all other holes, honeycomb spots, broken corners or edges, and
 other defects shall be thoroughly cleaned, and after having been kept saturated with water
 for at least three hours, shall be carefully pointed and trued with a mortar of cement and
 fine aggregate mixed in the proportions used in the class of the concrete being finished.
 Mortar used in pointing shall be not more than one hour old. The mortar patches shall be
 cured as specified under Subsection 804.03.17. All construction and expansion joints shall
 be left carefully tooled and free of mortar and concrete. The joint filler shall be left exposed
 for its full length with clean and true edges.
 
 The resulting surfaces shall be true and uniform. All surfaces that cannot be repaired to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer shall be given a Class 2 rubbed finish.
 804.03.19.3--Class 2, Rubbed or Spray Finish.
 804.03.19.3.1--Rubbed Finish. After removal of forms, the Class 1 finish shall be
 completed and the rubbing of concrete shall be started as soon as its condition will permit.
 Immediately before starting this work, the concrete shall be kept thoroughly saturated with
 water for at least three hours. Surfaces shall be rubbed with a medium course Carborundum
 stone using a small amount of mortar on its face. The mortar shall be composed of cement
 and sand mixed in the proportions used in the concrete being finished. Rubbing shall be
 continued until all form marks, projections, and irregularities have been removed, all voids
 are filled, and a uniform surface has been obtained. The paste produced by this rubbing
 shall be left in place at this time.
 
 After all concrete above the surface being treated has been cast, the final finish shall be
 obtained by rubbing with a fine Carborundum stone and water. This rubbing shall continue
 until the entire surface is of a smooth texture and uniform color.
 After the final rubbing is completed and the surface has dried, it shall be rubbed with burlap
 to remove loose powder and objectionable marks.
 804.03.19.3.2--Spray Finish. Prior to the spray finish, the concrete shall be given a Class
 1 finish in accordance with Subsection 804.03.19.2, supplemented if necessary with a grout
 meeting the requirements of Subsection 714.11 with fine aggregate modified to require 100
 percent passing the No. 16 Sieve.
 
 Grout shall be applied with burlap pads or float sponges. As soon as the grout has dried,
 the surface shall be brushed to remove all loose grout and the surface left smooth and free
 
 979
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 of air holes. Surfaces to be sprayed shall be free of efflorescence, flaking coatings, dirt,
 oil, and other foreign substances. Prior to application of the spray finish, the surfaces shall
 be free of moisture, as determined by sight and touch, and in a condition consistent with
 the manufacturer's published recommendations.
 The spray finish material shall meet the requirements of Subsection 714.12 and shall be
 listed on the Approved Sources of Materials. The spray finish shall be applied with heavy
 duty spray equipment capable of maintaining a constant pressure as necessary for proper
 application. The material shall be applied as recommended by the manufacturer except the
 rate of application shall not be less than one gallon per 50 square feet of surface area
 without prior written approval of the Engineer.
 The completed finish shall be tightly bonded to the structure and present a uniform
 appearance and texture equal to or better than a rubbed finish. If necessary, additional
 coats shall be sprayed to produce the desired surface texture and uniformity. Upon failure
 to adhere positively to the structure without chipping or cracking or to attain the desired
 surface appearance, the coatings shall be completely removed and the surface given a
 rubbed finish in accordance with Subsection 804.03.19.3.1, or other approved methods
 shall be used to obtain the desired surface finish to the satisfaction of the Engineer without
 additional cost to the State.
 804.03.19.4--Classes 3, 4, and 5 Finishes. If required, specifications for these finishes
 will be contained in the special provisions.
 804.03.19.5--Class 6, Floated Surface Finish. After the concrete has been deposited in
 place, it shall be consolidated and the surface shall be struck off by means of a strike board
 and floated with a wooden or cork float. An edging tool shall be used on edges and
 expansion joints. The surface shall not vary more than 1/8 inch under a 10-foot
 straightedge. The surface shall have a granular or matte texture that will not be slick when
 wet.
 804.03.19.6--Required Finishes for Various Surfaces.
 804.03.19.6.1--General. Unless otherwise specified, the top surface of sidewalks, the top
 horizontal surfaces of footings, and the top slabs of box bridges, box culverts, or other
 structures shall be given a Class 6 finish. All formed concrete surfaces shall be given a
 Class 1 finish, except on surfaces that are completely enclosed, such as the inside surfaces
 of cells of box girders, the removal of fins and form marks and the rubbing of mortared
 surfaces to a uniform color will not be required.
 
 In reference to finishing, exposed surfaces are surfaces or faces that may be seen after all
 backfill has been placed. Exposed surfaces requiring a Class 2 finish shall be finished at
 least one foot below the ground line or the low water elevation, whichever is higher.
 The Class 2 finish shall be made upon a Class 1 finish. After the removal of forms, the
 Class 1 finish shall be completed and the rubbing of concrete shall be started as soon as the
 condition of the concrete will permit.
 Bridge floors shall be finished in accordance with Subsection 804.03.19.7.

 804.03.19.7--Finishing Bridge Decks.
 804.03.19.7.1--General. Concrete bridge decks shall be struck off and finished by the
 method(s) designated on the plans.
 
 In the event a method is not designated, the Contractor may use either the longitudinal or
 transverse method subject to the requirements contained in these specifications.
 Except when indicated otherwise on the plans, the finish of the bridge deck shall be a belt
 finish, a broom finish, or one of the following drag methods: pan, double pan, burlap, or
 pan and burlap. Manual finishing of the bridge deck shall be performed only in areas
 inaccessible by the finishing equipment mounted to the strike-off screed, but shall not
 hinder the requirements for curing in accordance with Subsection 804.03.17.1. The surface
 texture specified and surface requirements shall be in accordance with the applicable
 requirements of Subsections 501.03.17 and 501.03.18 modified only as the Engineer deems
 necessary for bridge deck construction operations.
 At no time shall water on the surface of the concrete from bleeding, fogging, curing, or
 other sources be worked into the concrete or used as an aid for finishing.
 Regardless of the method of finishing selected, requirements for curing per Subsection
 804.03.17 shall be completed within the specified time limits. If the requirements in
 Subsection 804.03.17 are not completed within the specific time limits, the Contractor shall
 cease operations, revise his operations up to and including acquiring new or additional
 equipment or additional personnel in order to satisfy the requirements in Subsection
 804.03.17, and, on approval from the Engineer, resume operations.
 804.03.19.7.2--Longitudinal Method. The longitudinal method may be used for repairs
 to bridge decks or bridge widening projects. For bridge widening projects, curing in
 accordance with Subsection 804.03.17 shall be completed within 30 minutes of initial
 strike-off for bridges without skew and within 35 minutes of initial strike-off for bridges
 with skew.
 
 The longitudinal method requires that the strike-off screed be supported on accurately
 graded and supported bulkheads or templates placed across the full width at the end(s) of
 the pour. Before the concrete is placed, approved fixed templates or wooden bulkheads of
 not less than 1¼-inch lumber shall be placed perpendicular to the centerline of the roadway,
 or in the case of skew bridges at the angle of skew. At least one dry run shall be made the
 length of each pour with a "tell-tale" device attached to the screed to assure the specified
 clearance to the reinforcing steel. The upper surface of the template or bulkheads shall be
 accurately set to conform to the required grade and crown.
 Special attention shall be given to the gutter lines where the strike-off screed cannot reach.
 The gutters shall be finished by hand and tested with the straight edge. Floor drains shall
 be set lower than the finished gutter line and finished over. After initial set, the concrete
 shall be dished out and finished around the drains to form an outlet.
 After the concrete has been deposited and rough graded, it shall be struck off by means of
 a strike-off screed resting on the bulkheads or fixed templates. The strike-off screed shall
 be of a type satisfactory to the Engineer and shall have sufficient strength to retain its shape
 
 985
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 under all working conditions. The final surface shall comply with the applicable
 requirements of Subsections 501.03.17.6 and 501.03.18, and unless otherwise specified in
 the contract, the final finish under this method shall be the belt finish.
 In general, the overall strike-off screed should be trussed, with bracing heavy enough to
 support the weight of a man without deflecting, and should be adjustable for camber and
 correction of sag.
 The strike-off screed will ride on the bulkheads or fixed templates at the ends of the section
 being finished. Care shall be taken to see that the bulkhead or fixed template elevations
 are accurately set since the entire span surface will be controlled by them. The
 manipulation of the screed shall be such that neither end is raised from the bulkheads or
 templates during the process.
 The concrete shall be struck off by beginning at one curb and proceeding entirely across
 the span. A slight excess of concrete shall be kept in front of the cutting edge at all times.
 This operation shall be repeated at least three times. In each case, the strike-off screed
 shall be picked up and carried back to the point of beginning. No backward strokes will
 be allowed. The strike-off screed shall be moved along the bulkheads or fixed templates
 with a combined longitudinal and transverse motion. This operation may be manual or
 mechanical. Standing or walking in the fresh concrete ahead of the strike-off screed will
 not be permitted.
 804.03.19.7.3--Transverse Method. The transverse method requires that the screeding
 equipment be supported on accurately graded and supported rails placed beyond the gutter
 lines and parallel with the centerline of the bridge.
 
 The machine shall be constructed and operated in a manner that produces a bridge deck of
 uniform density with minimum manipulation of the fresh concrete in the shortest possible
 time. Manual transverse methods of screeding will not be permitted.
 The finishing machine shall be supported on vertically adjustable rails set a sufficient
 distance from the gutter line to allow free movement of the screed from gutter line to gutter
 line. Satisfactory means of load distribution with minimum rail deflection shall be
 provided. The screed rails for a deck pour shall be completely in place for the full length
 of the pour and shall be firmly secured prior to placing concrete. The screed rails shall be
 adjusted as necessary to compensate for settlement and deflection occurring during the
 screeding operations. Supports for the screed rail shall be located directly over slab
 overhang support brackets as referenced in Subsection 804.03.14.1.
 At least one dry run shall be made the length of each pour with a "tell-tale" device attached
 to the screed carriage to assure the specified clearance to the reinforcing steel.
 The screed shall be equipped with a metal cutting edge or other approved mechanical
 means for accurately fine grading the plastic concrete to the required grade and surface
 smoothness and shall be supported by a bridging structure sufficiently rigid and heavy to
 perform operations satisfactorily on concrete of minimum slump without vibration,
 distortion, and wrecking of forms. The screed shall be mechanically actuated to deliver
 the screeding action and for travel in a longitudinal direction at a uniform rate along the
 bridge deck.
 
 986
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 The screed shall complete sufficient passes to strike off all of the excess concrete with
 ample mortar along the entire leading edge to assure filling of low spots. Care shall be
 taken to remove all objectionable material from the gutters where final hand finishing will
 be required.
 The selection of the transverse method may require the Contractor to furnish bridge deck
 concrete that contains an approved water-reducing set-retarding admixture in the quantities
 approved by the Engineer at no additional cost to the State. See Subsection 713.02 for
 more information.
 Other finishing requirements shall be in accordance with the general requirements in
 Subsection 804.03.19.7.1 and as specified on the plans.
 804.03.19.7.4--Acceptance Procedure for Bridge Deck Smoothness. After the bridge
 decks and bridge end slabs are completed and preferably before the construction of the
 bridge railing, they shall be tested for ride quality using a Contractor furnished
 profilograph. Profile Index Values shall be determined in accordance with Department
 SOPs and these specifications. The profilograph shall meet the requirements of Subsection
 804.03.19.7.5. Profiles will be obtained in the wheel paths of the main thru lanes and,
 where conditions allow, in the wheel paths of any auxiliary lanes or tapers. Profile Index
 Values for bridge decks and bridge end slabs shall be obtained for all State roads with four
 lanes or more, on State roads three lanes or less where the current traffic count is 2000
 ADT or higher, or as designated on the plans. Ride quality tests will begin at a point where
 the rearmost wheel of the profilograph is as close to the beginning of the bridge end slab
 as possible and shall proceed forward across the remainder of the bridge end slab, across
 the bridge deck and continue across the next bridge end slab to a point where the frontmost wheel of the profilograph reaches the far-most edge of the bridge end slab. In addition
 to the Profile Index test, all bridge decks and bridge end slabs shall meet a 1/8 inch in 10foot straightedge requirement in both the longitudinal and traverse directions. Bridges and
 bridge end slabs not requiring a ride quality test must meet a 1/8 inch in 10-foot
 straightedge requirement in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Bridges in
 horizontal curves having a radius of less than 1000 feet at the centerline and bridges within
 the superelevation transition of such curves are excluded from a test with the profilograph.
 
 The Profile Index Value for bridge decks including the bridge end slabs shall be averaged
 for the left and right wheel path for each lane and where applicable, each auxiliary lane and
 taper, and shall not exceed 65 inches per mile for each lane. Auxiliary lanes, tapers,
 shoulders and other areas that are not checked with the profilograph, shall meet a 1/8 inch
 in 10-foot straightedge check made transversely and longitudinally across the deck or slab.
 In addition, individual bumps or depressions exceeding 0.3 of an inch, when measured
 from a chord length of 25 feet, shall be corrected and the surface shall meet a 1/8 inch in
 10-foot straightedge check made transversely across the deck or slab.
 Bridge decks and bridge end slabs not meeting the preceding requirements shall be
 corrected. Corrective work shall be done at no additional cost to the Department.
 Corrective work shall consist of grinding the bridge deck in accordance with this
 specification. All corrective work shall precede final surface texturing. After completion
 of final surface texturing, all surface areas corrected by grinding shall be sealed with a
 nonstaining 40% minimum alkylalkoxysilane penetrating sealant applied per the
 manufacturer’s directions.
 
 987
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 In case the bridge end slabs are to be constructed on a future project, the bridge deck(s)
 alone shall be tested for ride quality using the acceptance procedure outlined above, except
 that the ride quality test will begin at a point where the rearmost wheel of the profilograph
 is as close to the beginning of the bridge as possible and shall proceed forward across the
 bridge deck to a point where the front-most wheel of the profilograph reaches the far-most
 edge of the bridge.
 Expansion joint installation shall be delayed and the joint temporarily bridged to facilitate
 operation of the profilograph and grinding equipment across the joint wherever feasible.
 It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to schedule profilograph testing. The Contractor
 shall notify the Department at least five (5) days in advance of profilograph testing. The
 Contractor shall ensure that the area to be tested has been cleaned and cleared of all
 obstructions. Profilograph testing of bridge decks and bridge end slabs shall be performed
 by the Contractor under supervision of the Engineer. All profilograph testing shall be
 performed at no additional cost to the Department. The Contractor will be responsible for
 traffic control associated with this testing operation.
 804.03.19.7.4.1--Grinding Bridge Decks.
 804.03.19.7.4.1.1--Equipment. The grinding equipment shall be a power driven, selfpropelled machine that is specifically designed to smooth and texture hydraulic cement
 concrete pavement with diamond blades. The effective wheel base of the machine shall
 not be less than 12.0 feet. It shall have a set of pivoting tandem bogey wheels at the front
 of the machine and the rear wheels shall be arranged to travel in the track of the fresh cut
 pavement. The center of the grinding head shall be no further than 3.0 feet forward from
 the center of the back wheels.
 
 The equipment shall be of a size that will cut or plane at least 3.0 feet wide. It shall also

 work area. The equipment shall be capable of grinding the surface without causing spalls
 at cracks, joints, or other locations.
 804.03.19.7.4.1.2--Grinding. The grinding areas will be determined by the Contractor and
 approved by the Engineer. The Contractor shall develop and submit to the Engineer for
 approval a Grinding Plan. The Contractor shall allow up to 45 days for the Department to
 review the Plan prior to starting any grinding operations. This plan shall include as a
 minimum:
 
 Name of the project superintendent in charge of the grinding operation.

 (h) A detailed drawing of the deck showing areas to be ground with station numbers
 and grinding depths clearly indicated.
 (i) A description of grinding in areas where drains are in conflict with grind areas.
 (j) Details of any changes in deck drainage, anticipated ponding, etc.
 The Engineer will evaluate the grinding plan for conformance with the plans and
 specifications, after which the Engineer will notify the Contractor of any additional
 information required and/or changes that may be needed. Any part of the plan that is
 unacceptable will be rejected and the Contractor shall submit changes for reevaluation. All
 approvals given by the Engineer shall be subject to trial and satisfactory performance in
 the field, and shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to satisfactorily complete
 the work.
 The construction operation shall be scheduled and proceed in a manner that produces a
 uniform finished surface. Grinding will be accomplished in a manner that eliminates joint
 or crack faults while providing positive lateral drainage by maintaining a constant crossslope between grinding extremities in each lane. Auxiliary or ramp lane grinding shall
 transition as required from the mainline edge to provide positive drainage and acceptable
 riding surface.
 The operation shall result in a finished surface that conforms as close as possible to the
 typical cross-section and the requirements specified in Subsection 804.03.19.7.4.1.3.
 The Contractor shall establish positive means for removal of grinding residue. Residue
 shall not be permitted to flow across lanes used by public traffic or into gutters or drainage
 facilities.
 804.03.19.7.4.1.3--Final Surface Texture. The grinding process shall produce a finish
 surface that is as close as possible to grade and uniform in appearance with a longitudinal
 line type texture. The line type texture shall contain parallel longitudinal corrugations that
 present a narrow ridge corduroy type appearance. The peaks of the ridges shall be
 approximately 1/16 inch higher than the bottoms of the grooves with approximately 53 to
 57 evenly spaced grooves per foot. Grinding chip thickness shall be a minimum of 0.080
 inches thick.
 
 The finished bridge decks and bridge end slabs shall be retested for riding quality using a
 Contractor furnished profilograph meeting the requirements of Subsection 804.03.19.7.5.
 The finished results shall meet the following conditions:
 (a) Individual bumps or depressions shall not exceed 0.3 inches when measured from
 a chord length of 25 feet.
 (b) The final index value for the bridge deck and bridge end slabs shall be an average
 of both the right and left wheel paths of each lane and shall not exceed 65 inches
 per mile.
 The final profilogram will be furnished to the Engineer for informational purposes.
 804.03.19.7.5--Profilograph Requirements. The smoothness of the bridge deck will be
 determined by using a California Profilograph to produce a profilogram (profile trace) at
 each designated location. The surface shall be tested and corrected to a smoothness index
 as described herein with the exception of those locations or specific projects that are
 
 989
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 excluded from a smoothness test with the profilograph.
 The profilograph, furnished and operated by the Contractor under supervision of the
 Engineer, shall consist of a frame at least 25 feet in length supported upon multiple wheels
 having no common axle. The wheels shall be arranged in a staggered pattern so that no
 two wheels will simultaneously cross the same bump. A profile is to be recorded from the
 vertical movement of a sensing mechanism. This profile is in reference to the mean
 elevation of the contact points established by the support wheels. The sensing mechanism,
 located at the mid-frame, may consist of a single bicycle-type wheel or a dual-wheel
 assembly consisting of either a bicycle-type (pneumatic tire) or solid rubber tire vertical
 sensing wheel and a separate bicycle-type (pneumatic tire) longitudinal sensing wheel. The
 wheel(s) shall be of such circumference(s) to produce a profilogram recorded on a scale of
 one (1) inch equal to 25 feet longitudinally and one (1) inch equal to one (1) inch (full
 scale) vertically. Motive power may be provided manually or by the use of a propulsion
 unit attached to the center assembly. In operation, the profilograph shall be moved
 longitudinally along the pavement at a speed no greater than 3 MPH so as to reduce bounce
 as much as possible. The testing equipment and procedure shall comply with the
 requirements of Department SOP.
 The Contractor may elect to use a computerized version of the profilograph in lieu of the
 standard profilograph. If the computerized version of the profilograph is used, it shall meet
 the requirements of Subsection 804.03.19.7.5.1.
 804.03.19.7.5.1--Computerized Profilograph.
 804.03.19.7.5.1.1--General. The computerized profilograph, furnished and operated by
 the Contractor under the supervision of the Engineer, shall be equipped with an on-board
 computer capable of meeting the following conditions of this subsection.
 
 Vertical displacement shall be sampled every three (3) inches or less along the bridge deck.
 The profile data shall be bandpass filtered in the computer to remove all spatial
 wavelengths shorter than two (2) feet. This shall be accomplished by a third order, low
 pass Butterworth filter. The resulting band limited profile will then be computer analyzed
 according to the California Profilograph reduction process to produce the required inches
 per mile index. This shall be accomplished by fitting a linear regression line to the length
 of bridge. This corresponds to the perfect placement of the blanking band bar by a human
 trace reducer. Scallops above and below the blanking band are then detected and totaled
 according to the California protocol. Bump/Dip analysis shall take place according to the
 California Profilograph reduction process.
 The computerized profilograph shall be capable of producing a plot of the profile and a
 printout that gives the following data: Stations every twenty five (25) feet, bump/dip height
 and bump/dip length of specification (3/10 of an inch and 25 feet respectively), the
 blanking band width, date of measurement, total profile index in inches per mile for the
 measurement, total length of the measurement, and the raw inches for each segment.
 804.03.19.7.5.1.2--Mechanical Requirements. The profilograph shall consist of a frame
 twenty five (25) feet long supported at each end by multiple wheels. The frame shall be
 constructed to be easily dismantled for transporting. The profilograph shall be constructed
 from aluminum, stainless steel and chromed parts. The end support wheels shall be
 arranged in a staggered pattern such that no two wheels cross a transverse joint at the same
 
 990
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 time. The relative smoothness shall be measured by the vertical movement of an eight (8)
 inch or larger diameter sensing wheel at the midpoint of the 25-foot frame. The horizontal
 distance shall be measured by a twenty (20) inch or larger diameter pneumatic wheel. This
 profile shall be the mean elevation referenced to the twelve points of contact with the
 pavement established by the support wheels. Recorded graphical trace of the profile shall
 be on a scale of one inch equals one inch (full scale) vertical motion of the sensing wheel
 and one inch equals 25 feet horizontal motion of the profilograph.
 804.03.19.7.5.1.3--Computer Requirements. The computer shall have the ability to
 produce output on sight for verification. The computerized output shall indicate the profile
 index for each specified section of bridge deck. Variable low and high pass third-order
 Butterworth filtering options shall be available. The printout shall be capable of showing
 station marks automatically on the output. Blanking band positioning for each specified
 section of the bridge deck shall be placed according to the least squares fit line of the
 collected data. Variable bump and dip tests shall be available to show “must correct”
 locations on the printout. The computer must have the ability to display on screen “must
 correct” conditions and alert the user with an audible warning when a “must correct”
 location has been located. The computer must have the ability to store profile data for later
 reanalysis. The measurement program must be menu driven and PC compatible. User
 selected options, identification, calibration factors, and time and date stamps shall be
 printed at the top of each printed report for verification. The control software must be
 upgradeable. A power source shall be included for each profilograph and be capable of
 supplying all power needs for a full days testing.
 804.03.19.8--Finishing Horizontal Surfaces of Footings or Top Slabs of Box Bridges,
 Culverts, or Other Structures. The finishing of horizontal surfaces of footing or top slabs
 of box bridges, culverts, or other structures shall be achieved by placing an excess of
 material in the form and removing or striking off the excess with a template, forcing the
 coarse aggregate below the mortar surface. After the concrete has been struck off the
 surface shall be given a Class 6 finish.
 804.03.19.9--Finishing Exposed Surfaces of Sidewalks. After the concrete has been
 deposited in place it shall be consolidated and the exposed surface shall be given a Class 6
 finish. An edging tool of the required radius shall be used on all edges and at all expansion
 joints. The surface shall have a granular texture that will not be slick when wet.
 
 Sidewalk surfaces shall be laid out in blocks with an approved grooving tool as shown on
 the plans or as directed.
 804.03.20--Opening Bridges.
 804.03.20.1--Public Traffic. Unless otherwise specified, concrete bridge decks shall be
 closed to public highway traffic for a period of at least 21 days after placing concrete.
 804.03.20.2--Construction Traffic. Unless otherwise specified, concrete bridge decks
 shall be closed to construction traffic for the time required for curing in Subsection
 804.03.17 and the minimum required compressive strength for the concrete placed is
 obtained.

 Section 804
 
 804.03.21--Final Cleanup. Upon completion of the work all equipment, surplus materials,
 forms, and waste material shall be removed, the bridge cleaned, and the site of the work
 given a final cleanup.
 804.03.22--Precast-Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members.
 804.03.22.1--General. All installations and plants for the manufacture of precastprestressed bridge members shall be PCI (Precast / Prestressed Concrete Institute)
 Certified. Bridge members manufactured in plants or installations not so approved will not
 be accepted for use in the work. The Contractor or other manufacturer shall employ a
 technician skilled in the adopted system of prestressing to supervise the manufacturing
 operations. This technician shall be certified according to the guidelines of this
 specification. The Contractor shall develop and implement a Quality Control Program as
 per Division I of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition. The Quality Control Program
 shall be submitted to the District Materials Engineer for approval.
 804.03.22.2--Stressing Requirements. The jacks for stressing shall be equipped with
 accurate calibrated gauges for registering the jacking pressure. Means shall be provided
 for measuring elongation of strands to at least the nearest 1/16 inch.
 
 Prior to beginning work, the Contractor or manufacturer shall have all jacks to be used,
 together with their gauges, calibrated by an approved laboratory. All jacks and gauges
 shall have an accuracy of reading within two percent. The testing agency shall furnish the
 Engineer a statement certifying that the jacks and gauges meet this requirement. During
 the progress of the work, if a gauge appears to be giving erratic results or if the gauge
 pressure and elongations indicate materially differing stresses, recalibration will be
 required.
 Calibration of jacks and gauges shall be repeated at intervals deemed necessary by the
 Engineer. These intervals for calibration shall not exceed one year.
 Shop drawings of prestressed beams, including an erection plan, shall be submitted in
 duplicate to the Bridge Engineer for approval prior to manufacture of members.
 804.03.22.2.1--Methods. Plans for the particular bridge members will show prestressing
 by one of the following methods:
 (A) Pretensioning. The prestressing strands are stressed initially. After the concrete is
 placed, cured, and has attained the compressive strength shown on the plans, the stress is
 transferred to the member. The method used for pretensions shall be in accordance to
 Division V of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition.
 (B) Posttensioning. The posttensioning tendons are installed in voids or ducts and are
 stressed and anchored after development of the compressive strength specified on the plans.
 The voids or ducts are then pressure grouted.
 (C) Combined Method. Part of the reinforcing is pretensioned and part posttensioned.
 Under this method all applicable requirements for the two methods specified shall apply to
 the respective stressing elements being used.

 Section 804
 
 804.03.22.2.2--Alternate Details for Prestressed Members. In the event that the
 Contractor / Manufacturer desires to use materials or methods that differ in any respect
 from those shown on the plans or described in these specifications, the Contractor shall
 submit for approval full plan details on acceptable tracings suitable for reproduction and
 specifications that shall become the property of the Department. In order for alternate
 materials and/or methods to be considered, they will be required to comply fully with the
 following:
 
 (a)
 (b)
 (c)
 (d)
 
 Provisions equal to those stipulated in these specifications.
 Current AASHTO Specifications.
 Recommendations of materials manufacturer.
 Camber tolerance of beams and spans shown on plans.
 
 Note: Alternate materials and methods will not be authorized on Federal-Aid Projects.
 The Engineer shall be the sole judge as to the adequacy and propriety of any variation of
 materials or methods.
 804.03.22.2.3--Stressing Procedure.
 (A) General. Stressing shall be performed by suitable jacks working against unyielding
 anchorages and capable of maintaining the required stress for an indefinite period without
 movement or yielding. Strands may be stressed singularly or in a group.
 
 The tension to be applied to each strand shall be as shown on the plans. The tension shall
 be measured by both jacking gauges and elongations in the strands and the result shall
 check within close limits.
 It is anticipated that there will possibly be a difference in indicated tension between jack
 pressure and elongation of about five (5) percent. In this event, the discrepancy shall be
 placed on the side of slight overstress rather than understress.
 In the event of an apparent discrepancy between gauge pressure and elongation of as much
 as five (5) percent, the entire operation shall be carefully checked, and the source of error
 determined before proceeding further.
 Elongation is to be measured after the strands have been suitably anchored, and all possible
 slippage at the anchorages has been eliminated.
 In all stressing operations, the stressing force shall be kept as nearly symmetrical about the
 vertical axis of the member as practicable.
 (B) Pretensioning. All strands to be prestressed shall be brought to a uniform initial
 tension prior to being given their full pretensioning. This uniform initial tension of
 approximately 1000 to 2000 pounds shall be measured by suitable means such as a
 dynamometer so that its value can be used as a check against elongation computed and
 measured.
 
 After the initial tensioning, the strand or group shall be stressed until the required
 elongation and jacking pressure is within the limits specified.
 
 993
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 When the strands are stressed in accordance with the plan requirements and these
 specifications and all other reinforcing is in place, the concrete shall be placed in the
 prepared forms.
 Strand stress shall be maintained until the concrete between anchorages has attained the
 required compressive strength as determined by cylinder tests, after which the strands shall
 be cut off flush with the ends of column members, and cut as shown on the plans for beams,
 girders, etc. Strands shall be cut or released in such a manner that eccentricity of prestress
 will be kept to a minimum and no damage to the member will result. The strand cutting
 pattern shall be as shown on the plans or as approved by the Bridge Engineer.
 (C) Posttensioning. For all posttensioning tendons/bars the anchor plates shall set exactly
 normal in all directions to the axis of the tendon/bar. Parallel wire anchorage cones shall
 be recessed within the beams. Tensioning shall not take place until the concrete has
 reached the compressive strength shown on the plans.
 
 Elongation and jacking pressures shall make appropriate allowance for all possible slippage
 or relaxation of the anchorage. Posttensioning tendons/bars shall be stressed in the order
 and manner shown on the plans.
 The units shall be tensioned until the required elongations and jacking pressures are
 attained and reconciled within the limits specified in Subsection 804.03.22.2.3(A) with
 such overstresses as approved by the Engineer for anchorage relaxation.
 Independent references shall be established adjacent to each anchorage to indicate any
 yielding or slippage that may occur between the time of initial stressing and final release
 of the strands.
 Straight tendons/bars may be tensioned from one end. Unless otherwise specified, curved
 tendons shall be stressed by jacking from both ends of the tendons.
 (D) Combined Method. In the event that girders are manufactured with part of the
 reinforcement pretensioned and part posttensioned, the applicable portions of the
 requirements listed herein shall apply to each type.
 804.03.22.3--Manufacture.
 804.03.22.3.1--Forms. The forms used for precast-prestressed bridge members shall meet
 the requirements of Division II of the PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition.
 804.03.22.3.2--Placing and Fastening Steel. Placing and fastening of all steel used for
 precast-prestressed bridge members shall meet the requirements of Division V of the PCI
 Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition.
 804.03.22.3.3--Holes for Prestressing Tendons/Bars. Holes provided in girders for
 prestressing tendons/bars shall be formed by means of inflatable rubber tubing, flexible
 metal conduit, metal tubing, or other approved means.

 804.03.22.4.1--Placing. The placing of concrete shall meet the applicable requirements of
 Division III of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition.
 804.03.22.4.2--Curing. Initial and accelerated curing of all members shall meet the
 applicable requirements of Division IV of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition
 except for the requirements listed in this subsection.
 
 The source of heat for accelerated cure shall be steam. Calibrated thermocouples shall be
 implanted into the concrete members to monitor areas expected to have maximum and
 minimum heat. Curing methods and procedures listed in the prestress producer’s PCI
 Quality System Manual shall be approved by the Department before their implementation.
 804.03.22.4.3--Removal of Side Forms. Side forms may be removed after the concrete
 has attained sufficient strength to maintain a true section. In order to obtain "sufficient
 strength," it may be necessary to cure members for 12 hours or more as prescribed in
 Subsection 804.03.22.4.2, or to attain a minimum compressive strength of 1000 psi.
 
 If high-early-strength concrete is obtained by use of low slump (0 to 1.5-inch) concrete,
 vacuum process, or other approved methods, side forms may be removed earlier; however,
 approval of the methods and revision from normal schedules will be made only after
 inspections by the District Materials Engineer and Materials Division have determined that
 satisfactory results will be attained by the methods and schedules proposed.
 804.03.22.4.4--Grouting. The holes through posttensioned members in which the tendons
 are installed shall be equipped with approved grouting vents. All prestressing tendons to
 be bonded shall be free of dirt, loose rust, grease, or other deleterious substances. Before
 grouting, the ducts shall be free of water, dirt, and other foreign substances. The ducts
 shall be blown out with compressed air until no water comes through the ducts. For long
 members with draped tendons, an open tap at low points may be necessary. After
 completion of stressing, the annular space between sides of tendon and sides of hole shall
 be grouted as outlined in the following paragraphs.
 
 With the grouting vent open at one end of the core hole, grout shall be applied continuously
 under moderate pressure at the other end until all entrapped air is forced out through the
 open grout vent, as evidenced by a steady stream of grout at the vent. The open vent shall
 then be closed under pressure. The grouting pressure shall be gradually increased to a
 refusal of at least 75 psi and held at this pressure for approximately 10 seconds, and the
 vent shall then be closed under this pressure.
 Hydraulic cement grout shall consist of a mixture of:
 1
 1/4
 3/4
 4 to 6
 
 part Type 1 hydraulic cement
 part fly ash
 part washed sand *
 gallons of water per bag of cement.
 
 * all passing No. 16 sieve and not more than 5% retained on No. 30
 Water-reducing admixtures, subject to approval by the Engineer, shall be used in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 995
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 The grout shall be mixed in a mechanical mixer, shall have the consistency of heavy paint,
 and shall be kept agitated until placed.
 Members shall not be moved before the grout has set, ordinarily at least 24 hours at 80°F
 or higher.
 804.03.22.5--Finishing and Marking. Units shall be given a Class 1 finish at the plant
 and shall be given a Class 2 finish after erection when required.
 
 Recesses in girders at end of diaphragm bars, holes left by form ties, and other surface
 irregularities shall be carefully cleaned and patched with an approved non-shrink
 commercial grout or a non-shrinkage mortar of the following composition:
 1 part Type 1 hydraulic cement
 1 1/2 to 2 parts fine sand
 1/2 to 3/4 ounces aluminum powder per bag of cement
 Approved admixture per Subsection 713.02.
 Sufficient water to produce a workable but rather stiff mix.
 The units shall be clearly marked in accordance with Department’s Materials Division
 Inspection, Certification and Testing Manual.
 804.03.22.6--Handling, Storage, and Installation. Posttensioned members may be
 handled immediately after completion of stressing and grout has set. Pretensioned members
 may be handled immediately after release of tensioning. In either case, the members shall
 have developed a minimum compressive strength of 4000 psi prior to handling. In the
 event stressing is not done in a continuous operation, members shall not be handled before
 they are sufficiently stressed, as determined by the Engineer, to sustain all forces and
 bending moments due to handling. In the handling, storage, and transporting of beams or
 girders, they shall be maintained in an upright position (position as cast) at all times and
 shall be picked up from points within distance from beam ends equal to beam depth or at
 pick-up points designated on the plans. Disregard of this requirement and dropping of units
 may be cause for rejection, whether or not injury to the unit is apparent. Piles shall be
 picked up and loaded for shipment at points shown by the suspension diagram on the plans.
 Extreme care shall be used in handling and storing piles to prevent damage. The dropping
 of a pile may be cause for rejection of same, whether or not there is apparent injury to the
 member.
 
 Care shall be exercised during the storage, hoisting, and handling of precast units to prevent
 damage. Damaged units shall be replaced by the Contractor at no additional costs to the
 State.
 When members are stacked for storage, each layer shall be supported at or near the pickup points. Supports shall be carefully placed in a vertical line in order that the weight of
 any member will not stress an underlying member. To prevent damage in moving members
 it is suggested that rigid supports be covered with a cushion of wood or other resilient
 material.
 Members shall not be transported until at least one day after the concrete has reached a
 compressive strength of 5000 psi or greater strength when shown on the plans.
 
 996
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 Piles used in salt water shall not be driven until concrete is seven days old, and air-entrained
 concrete shall be used in such piles.
 After prestressed concrete voided slab units are set, doweled and bolted in their final
 position, the keyways and dowel holes shall be filled with an approved non-shrink grout.
 Traffic shall not be permitted on the spans for 24 hours after grouting, and heavy
 construction equipment exceeding 15 tons will not be permitted on the spans for a period
 of 72 hours after grouting.
 Adjacent slab units that mismatch more than one-fourth inch shall be adjusted prior to
 grouting of the shear keys. The maximum deviation from cross-section and grade
 (exclusive of camber) at any point shall not exceed one-fourth inch. When the surface is
 checked with a ten-foot straightedge applied both parallel and perpendicular to the
 centerline, the variance shall not exceed one-fourth inch.
 In addition to the requirements set out in this section, the applicable requirements of
 Section 803 shall apply.
 804.03.22.7--Tolerances for Accepting Precast Prestressed Concrete. Members shall
 meet the dimension tolerances set by Division VII of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest
 Edition.
 804.03.22.8--Testing of Materials. Concrete and aggregate testing shall meet the
 requirements of Division VI of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition, except that
 the concrete mixture design shall meet the requirements of Subsection 804.02.10. Also, in
 addition to concrete compressive tests samples made for detensioning and 28-day strength,
 test samples shall be made and tested in order to prove compliance to the requirements of
 Subsection 804.03.22.6 for handling and shipping prestressed members. Compressive
 strength test cylinders for detensioning, handling and shipping shall receive the same type
 curing as the prestressed members for which they represent. Compressive strength samples
 shall be made each day for each prestress casting bed.
 804.03.22.9--Testing Personnel. Technicians testing hydraulic cement concrete used in
 the production of precast-prestressed members shall be PCI Quality Control
 Technician/Inspector Certified. Each producer of precast-prestressed members shall have
 at least one PCI Level II certified technician on site during production for Department
 projects.
 804.03.22.10--Documentation. The Precast-Prestressed Producer for each precastprestressed concrete bridge member shall maintain documentation as set forth in the
 Department’s Materials Division Inspection, Certification and Testing Manual. Testing
 and inspection record forms shall be approved by the Central Laboratory and as a minimum
 contain information listed in Division VI of PCI Quality Control Manual, Latest Edition.
 804.03.22.11--Use in the Work. Before any precast-prestressed member is incorporated
 into the work, documentation as described in Subsection 804.03.22.10 is required along
 with visual inspection of the member at the bridge construction site. Project Office
 personnel as per the Department’s Materials Division Inspection, Certification and Testing
 Manual will make visual inspection of the precast-prestressed member at the bridge
 construction site.

 804.04--Method of Measurement. Concrete, complete and accepted, will be measured in
 cubic yards. The concrete volume will be computed from the neat dimensions shown on
 the plans, except for such variations as may be ordered in writing by the Engineer. The
 quantity of concrete involved in fillets, scorings, and chamfers one square inch or less in
 cross-sectional area will be neglected. Deductions shall be made for the following:
 
 (a) The volume of structural steel, including steel piling encased in concrete.
 (b) The volume of timber piles encased in concrete, assuming the volume to be 0.80
 cubic foot per linear foot of pile.
 (c) The volume of concrete piles encased in concrete.
 The volume of concrete in the fillets between the bottom of nominal slab and the top of the
 beams has been estimated by using one half (1/2) of the fillet height at the bearing
 multiplied by the top flange width for the full length of the beam. This volume shall be
 used for final pay quantity. The calculated volume of concrete may or may not be equal to
 the actual volume of concrete that is placed in the fillet. The volume of fillet concrete used
 for final pay quantity is based upon the plan fillet height at bearing and a zero inch (0”)
 plan fillet height at midspan. If the Contractor feels that variations from these dimensions
 will be encountered, they should adjust their bid accordingly.
 No deduction will be made for the volume of concrete displaced by steel reinforcement,
 floor drains, or expansion joint material that is one inch or less in width normal to the
 centerline of the joint. Where railing is bid as a separate item, that portion of the railing
 above the top of the curb, above the surface of the sidewalk, or above the bridge roadway,
 as the case may be, will not be included in the measurement of concrete, but will be
 measured as railing. Massive pylons or posts that are to be excluded from payment for
 railing and are intended to be measured for as concrete will be so noted on the plans.
 When shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer, concrete placed as a seal for
 cofferdams will be measured by the cubic yard actually in place, except that no
 measurement will be made of seal concrete placed outside of an area bounded by vertical
 planes 18 inches outside the neat lines of the footing as shown on the plans or as directed
 and parallel thereto.
 Reinforcing steel will be measured and paid for in pounds as set out in Section 805.
 Unless otherwise specified, structural steel will be measured and paid for as set out in
 Section 810.
 Excavation for bridges will be measured and paid for as in Section 801.
 Piling will be measured and paid for as set out in Sections 802 and 803.
 Railing will be measured and paid for as set out in Section 813.
 Prestressed concrete beams and plank will be measured by the linear foot.
 Prestressed concrete voided slab units, interior and exterior with railing, and precast
 concrete caps, intermediate and end cap with winged abutment wall, of the size and type
 specified will be measured by the unit complete in place and accepted. Railing, winged
 
 998
 
 Section 804
 
 Section 804
 
 abutment walls, grout, tie rods, nuts, washers, bearing pads and other appurtenances will
 not be measured for separate payment.
 804.05--Basis of Payment. Concrete will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic
 yard for the class or classes specified, complete in place. Prestressed concrete beams and
 plank will be paid for at the contract unit per linear foot of specified size and type.
 
 Prestressed concrete voided slab units and precast caps will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per each for the specified types and sizes, complete in place and accepted, which
 price shall be full compensation for furnishing, hauling and erecting the members,
 including all prestressing reinforcement and other reinforcement in the members. Payment
 at the contract unit price shall be full compensation for furnishing all materials, equipment,
 tools, labor and incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 Payment will be made under:

 806.02.1--Sampling and Testing. As referenced in Subsection 106.03, approval of the
 source of supply of cement, fine and coarse aggregate, water, reinforcement and other
 materials used in the construction of the caps, slabs and wings and the results of tests
 showing their suitability for use shall be obtained prior to their use in any construction.
 Samples shall be submitted as directed.
 
 The Contractor/Manufacturer without extra compensation, shall supply the Engineer's
 plant inspector with the necessary materials and representative concrete mix for making a
 minimum of one test cylinder of concrete for each seven caps, slabs, or wings or a minimum
 of one test cylinder per day if less than seven caps, slabs, or wings are constructed. Other
 test cylinders may be required by the Engineer to establish strength for handling slabs or
 caps. Cylinders are to be cured with the same method used in curing the caps, slabs, or
 wings, as the case may be. Only those caps, slabs, or wings bearing identification marks
 of acceptance by the Department or approved laboratories will be permitted for use in the
 construction. The acceptance of any precast concrete member at the production plant shall
 in no way be final and further inspection will be made at the structure site before and after
 the member has been placed in its final position.
 806.03--Construction Requirements.
 806.03.1--General. The methods of construction shall conform, unless otherwise
 stipulated, to the provisions and requirements prescribed in these specifications and
 indicated on the plans for the several items that constitute the complete structure.
 806.03.2--Substructure. The substructure shall be constructed in conformity with Section
 803 and as indicated on the plans. Payment for same will be made under Section 803,
 unless otherwise indicated.
 
 The piles shall be so driven that the cap may be placed in its proper location without
 excessive manipulation of the piles.
 806.03.3--Precast Caps, Slabs, and Wings.
 806.03.3.1--Proportioning and Mixing Concrete. The composition, proportioning and
 mixing of the concrete used in this construction shall be as specified in Section 804,
 Concrete Bridges and Structures, and shall be the class concrete specified on the plans.
 806.03.3.2--Reinforcing Steel. Reinforcing steel shall be of the quality, type, and size
 specified on the plans and placed as indicated. It shall meet the requirements set out in
 Subsection 711.02, as applicable.
 
 Separate payment will not be made for reinforcing steel.
 806.03.3.3--Forms. All forms shall be of metal or wood. They shall be built mortar-tight
 and of sufficient rigidity to prevent any distortion due to pressure of the concrete and other
 loads incident to the construction operations. The forms shall be substantial and unyielding
 and shall be so designed that the finished concrete will conform to the proper dimensions
 and contours. The design of the forms shall take into account the effect of vibration of
 concrete as it is placed.
 
 1003
 
 Section 806
 
 Section 806
 
 Forms shall be filleted at all sharp corners and shall be given a bevel or draft in the case of
 all projections to ensure easy removal.
 All forms shall be set and maintained true to the lines designated until the concrete is
 sufficiently hardened or for periods as hereinafter specified.
 Forms shall be treated with oil immediately before placing concrete in them. Any material
 that will adhere to, or discolor, the concrete shall not be used. Extreme care shall be
 exercised to make sure that no oil gets on the reinforcing steel.
 806.03.3.4--Handling and Placing Concrete. Prior to the placing of any concrete, the
 forms shall be thoroughly cleaned of any construction debris and extraneous matter and the
 reinforcing bars of the size and type indicated placed and secured in the forms as indicated
 on the plans. Concrete shall not be deposited in the forms until the inspector has checked
 the placing of the reinforcement and has given approval to proceed.
 
 Ready mix concrete transported in a truck mixer or truck agitator shall be discharged at the
 site of the work and placed in its final position in the forms within one hour after the
 introduction of the mixing water to the cement and aggregate or the cement to the aggregate
 whichever occurs first, except that in abnormal weather, or under other conditions
 contributing to the quick stiffening of the concrete, the Engineer may make a determination
 of a lesser time for placement considering all factors affecting initial set of the concrete.
 When mixed concrete is transported in approved non-agitating trucks, the concrete shall be
 discharged at the work site within thirty minutes after the introduction of the mixing water
 to the cement and aggregate.
 The concrete shall be placed so as to avoid segregation of the materials and the
 displacement of the reinforcement. Open troughs and chutes used shall be of metal or
 metal lined and shall be kept clean and free from coating of hardened concrete by flushing
 with water after each pour. Water used for flushing shall be discharged clear of the cap,
 slab, or wing forms.
 806.03.3.5--Compaction. Concrete for the caps, slabs, and wings during and immediately
 after depositing shall be thoroughly compacted by the use of vibrators and suitable spading
 tools. Vibration shall be applied at the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited
 concrete. The vibration shall be internal and shall be of sufficient duration and intensity to
 thoroughly compact the concrete, but shall not be continued so as to cause segregation.
 Vibration shall not be continued at any one point to the extent that localized areas of grout
 are formed.
 
 The entire operation of depositing and consolidating the concrete shall be so conducted
 that the concrete shall be smooth, dense and free from any honeycomb or pockets of
 segregated aggregates. The roadway surface of slabs and tops of caps and wings shall be
 finished with a wood float.
 Concrete in the precast caps, slabs and wings shall be placed in one continuous operation
 for each cap, slab, and wing.
 806.03.3.6--Placing Bolts, Drains, Bolt Holes, etc. All bolts, drains, bolt holes, etc.,
 indicated on the plans as necessary or desirable shall be placed in the concrete at the
 
 1004
 
 Section 806
 
 Section 806
 
 locations indicated on the plans. They shall be formed by approved methods and operations
 and shall be such as to ensure proper connections.
 806.03.3.7--Removal of Forms and Curing. Side forms for precast concrete bridge caps,
 slabs and wings may be removed after the concrete has attained sufficient strength to
 maintain a true section. The minimum time for removal, using alternate types of curing, is
 considered to be as follows:
 
 (a) With a minimum of three thicknesses of wetted burlap, cotton mats, or constant
 fogging with temperatures of more than 40°F and less than 80°F -- 24 hours; with
 temperatures 80°F and higher -- 20 hours.
 (b) Steaming in enclosures at temperatures of not less than 80°F and not more than
 150°F -- 12 hours.
 When Type III Cement is permitted, side forms may be removed after 12 hours using all
 types of curing.
 Bottom forms shall remain in place until the concrete has obtained a minimum compressive
 strength of 2,500 psi as determined by cylinder tests. When the caps, slabs, or wings are
 moved, they shall be deposited directly on a level hard-surfaced true-plane area without
 stacking and shall remain undisturbed for seven days beyond the period of initial handling
 while the curing continues.
 Caps, slabs and wings shall be covered with wetted burlap immediately after the finishing
 operations.
 Liquid membrane curing may be used, but shall be white pigmented and applied at the rate
 of not less than one gallon per 150 square feet of surface. The entire surface and exposed
 edges shall be sprayed with the membrane as soon as practicable after finishing is complete
 and as side forms are removed. The seal shall be applied to the surface as a fine mist that
 shall provide a continuous, uniform, water impermeable film. The bottom of the caps,
 slabs, or wings shall be sealed with the membrane when they are removed from the bottom
 supporting forms.
 The Contractor may use steam curing provided the Engineer has given written approval
 prior to casting operations. Steam curing shall be according to stipulations set out in
 Subsection 804.03.22.4.2.
 The cap, slab, wing and rail units shall not be shipped until the concrete has obtained the
 specified minimum compressive strength as determined by cylinder tests.
 806.03.4--Tolerance of Dimensions.
 806.03.4.1--Caps. The width and length of the caps shall not vary more than one-quarter
 inch from the plan dimensions. The bottom of the cap shall be smooth and shall not vary
 more than one-eighth of an inch when tested with a straightedge in a horizontal direction
 for any ten-foot length. The top of the caps shall not vary more than one-sixteenth inch
 from the slope shown on the plans.
 806.03.4.2--Slabs. The four sides of the slab shall not vary more than one-eighth inch for
 the full depth of the slab when tested with a straightedge in a vertical direction, nor more
 
 1005
 
 Section 806
 
 Section 806
 
 than one-quarter inch in the full length of the slab when tested with a straightedge in a
 horizontal direction, nor shall the top of the slab vary more than one-eighth inch in any tenfoot length.
 806.03.4.3--Wings. The width and length of the wings shall not vary more than onequarter inch from the plan dimensions.
 806.03.4.4--Concrete Barrier Rail. The width of the rail shall not vary more than oneeighth inch and the length shall not vary more than one-quarter inch. The sides shall be
 smooth with no discolorations. In the event patching is required, the entire rail shall be
 given a Class 2 finish.
 806.03.5--Handling and Placing Precast Caps, Slabs, Barrier Rail and Wings. The
 precast caps, slabs, barrier rail, and wings shall be handled in such a manner that they will
 not be subjected to excessive and undue abuse producing crushing, spalling, or undue
 marring of the concrete. Injury to units may be cause for rejection whether the injury to
 the unit is apparent or not. Damaged units shall be replaced by the Contractor at no
 additional costs to the State.
 
 Where the caps, slabs, barrier rail, and wings are to be loaded or stored in tiers, the blocking
 between the tier should be in a vertical plane so that the weight of the upper caps, slabs or
 wings cannot produce bending in those of a lower tier.
 After the caps are set and doweled, welded, or grouted to the piling, the dowel holes shall
 be filled with grout or AC-13 before the slabs are set.
 Each section or unit shall be placed as closely as possible to its final position in the structure
 so that the use of bars or other tools that might mar the concrete will be eliminated. The
 abutting edges of each slab unit shall be carefully cleaned of any concrete or extraneous
 matter in order that the longitudinal joints may be bolted tightly together.
 After the slab units are set, doweled and bolted in their final position, the keyways and
 dowel holes shall be filled with an approved non-shrink grout. Traffic shall not be
 permitted on the spans for 24 hours and heavy construction type traffic, or other loads
 exceeding 15 tons, will not be allowed on the spans for a period of 72 hours after grouting.
 When epoxy grout is allowed, these time requirements may be reduced to 12 hours. When
 a non-shrink commercial grout is used, the 72-hour time requirement may be reduced to
 24 hours.
 Expansion material shall be placed between all bearing points of the slabs and surfaces of
 the caps. When not otherwise specifically provided, three layers of No. 15, Type I, roofing
 felt shall be used.
 806.03.5.1--Transverse Joints. When a bridge consists of more than one span, bituminous
 premolded joint filler, one-quarter inch in thickness, shall be placed in the joint between
 spans. This joint filler shall be for the full thickness of the concrete, less one inch at the
 top of the slab, and for the full width of the structure, including curb. When the spans are
 completely in place and bolted the transverse joints shall be sealed with AC-13 or other
 joint sealer approved by the Engineer.
 
 1006
 
 Section 806
 
 Section 806
 
 806.03.5.2--Railing. The bridge railing shall be installed after all other work on the bridge
 has been completed.
 
 The material used shall meet the dimensions and requirements specified on the plans and
 the railing shall be constructed in conformity with the details indicated and to the lines and
 grades established.
 806.04--Method of Measurement. Precast concrete slab units, either interior or curb
 units, precast barrier rail units and precast concrete caps either intermediate or end bent
 with winged abutment wall of the size and type specified will be measured by the unit per
 each.
 
 Winged abutment walls, grout, tie rods, nuts, washers, bearing pads and other
 appurtenances will not be measured for separate payment.
 806.05--Basis of Payment. Precast concrete slab units, precast barrier rail units and
 precast concrete caps, measured as prescribed above, will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per each for the specified types and sizes. This price shall be full compensation for

 computed from the horizontal length of the wall segments and the average wall height
 between the bottom of the wall or top of the base leveling pad and the top of the wall. In
 the case of a battered wall, either specified in the plans or battered at the Contractor’s
 option, the vertical distance will be used in the area calculation and not the slope distance
 along the face of the wall.
 809.05--Basis of Payment. The retaining wall system shall be paid for at the contract unit
 price per square foot, which price shall be full compensation for the design and construction
 of the retaining wall system, all excavation, select backfill material, leveling pads,
 undercut, all the materials for the wall drainage system, facing materials, soil
 reinforcement, equipment, labor, and incidentals necessary to complete the work as
 directed by the Engineer.

 SECTION 810 - STEEL STRUCTURES
 810.01--Description. This work consists of furnishing, fabricating, preparing, assembling,
 erecting, and painting structural steel and all accessories and other metal parts required in
 steel spans. This work shall be constructed as indicated on the plans, in reasonably close
 conformity with the lines, grades, dimensions, and design shown, and in accordance with
 the applicable provisions and requirements in other sections of these specifications for the
 different items that constitute the complete structure.
 
 All structural steel work shall be performed in accordance with these specifications and the
 AASHTO Guide Specification for Highway Bridge Fabrication with HPS70W Steel.
 Fabricators shall be certified in accordance with the AISC Quality Certification Program
 
 1021
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 in the Major Steel Bridges (CBR) category with Fracture Critical Endorsement (F) prior to
 the start of fabrication.
 These specifications apply to bolted and welded construction when indicated in the
 contract.
 810.02--Materials.
 810.02.1--General. Unless otherwise specified, structural steel, miscellaneous metals, and
 paints shall conform to the applicable requirements of this section and Sections 710, 716,
 717, and 814. Unless otherwise specified, structural carbon steel, ASTM A709 Grade
 50/50W, shall be furnished.
 810.02.2--Drawings. The Contractor shall prepare shop drawings for all materials to be
 fabricated. The size of the sheets on which the drawings are prepared shall conform to the
 standard bridge sheet of the Department. Two complete sets of prints shall be submitted to
 the Bridge Engineer for approval prior to ordering any materials for fabrication.
 
 For all fabrication to be done by welding, two copies of welding procedures in accordance
 with the provisions of ANSI/ASSHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code, hereinafter
 referred to as the Welding Code, shall also be submitted to the Bridge Engineer for
 approval. After final approval of the shop drawings and welding procedures, if applicable,
 six complete sets of prints shall be submitted to the Bridge Engineer. As required by
 special conditions, the Bridge Engineer shall be furnished with as many additional sets of
 prints as may be necessary. Shop drawings for railroad bridges shall be prepared with ink
 on linen tracing cloth or other approved equal, which shall be delivered to the Bridge
 Engineer prior to final acceptance of the project. No changes shall be made in a shop
 drawing after it has been approved, nor shall steel sections different from those shown on
 the plans be substituted except with the written consent or direction of the Engineer.
 Prior to the fabrication of any part of a structure, shop drawings and welding procedures
 for that part of the structure shall have been given final, unconditional approval by the
 Bridge Engineer. Work performed prior to approval of drawing and procedures may be
 rejected.
 810.02.3--Shop Painting. Shop painting, unless otherwise designated or permitted, shall
 consist of inorganic zinc primer, Section 710, applied as specified in Section 814.
 Machine-finished surfaces of pins, pin rollers and bores shall be coated as soon as
 practicable after acceptance with a heavy coat of Petrolatum meeting the requirements of
 ASTM D 217, NLGI Consistency Grade 2 or 3, or other approved coating prior to removal
 from the shop.
 810.02.4--Storage of Materials. Structural material, either plain or fabricated, shall be
 stored at the bridge shop above ground on platforms, skids, or other supports. It shall be
 kept free from dirt, grease, and other foreign matter and shall be protected as far as
 practicable from corrosion.
 810.02.5--Straightening Material. Rolled material, before being laid off or worked, must
 be straight. If straightening is necessary, it shall be done by methods that will not injure
 the metal. Heat straightening of ASTM A514/A517 steel shall be done only under rigidly
 controlled procedures and each application subject to the approval of the Engineer. In no
 
 1022
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 case shall the maximum temperature of the steel exceed 1125°F. Sharp kinks and bends
 will be cause for rejection of the material.
 810.02.6--Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders. Steels that are manufactured to
 a yield point greater than 50,000 psi shall not be heat curved.
 810.02.6.1--Type of Heating. Beams and girders may be curved by either continuous or
 V-type heating as approved by the Engineer. For the continuous method, a strip along the
 edge of the top and bottom flange shall be heated simultaneously. The strip shall be of
 sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature. For the V-type heating,
 the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in truncated triangular or wedge-shaped areas
 having their bases along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange.
 The spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the required curvature, and
 heating shall progress along the top and bottom flange at approximately the same rate.
 
 For the V-type heating, the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange
 surface shall terminate just before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached. To
 avoid unnecessary web distortion, special care shall be taken when heating the inside flange
 surface so the heat is not applied directly to the web. When the radius of curvature is 1000
 feet or more, the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside
 flange surface shall extend to the juncture of the flange and web. When the radius of
 curvature is less than 1000 feet, the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied
 to the outside flange surface shall extend past the web for a distance equal to 1/8 of the
 flange or three (3) inches, whichever is less. The truncated triangular pattern shall have an
 included angle of approximately 15 to 30 degrees, but the base of the triangle shall not
 exceed 10 inches. Variations in the patterns prescribed above may be made with the
 approval of the Engineer.
 For both types of heating, the flange edges to be heated are those that will be on the inside
 of the horizontal curve after cooling. Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is
 only mandatory when the flange thickness is 1¼ inches or greater, in which case the two
 surfaces shall be heated concurrently. The maximum temperatures shall be as prescribed
 below.
 810.02.6.2--Temperature. The heat-curving operation shall be conducted in such a
 manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed 1150°F as measured by
 temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means. The girder shall not be artificially
 cooled until after naturally cooling to 600°F. The method of artificial cooling is subject to
 the approval of the Engineer.
 810.02.6.3--Position for Heating. The girder may be heat- curved with the web in either
 a vertical or a horizontal position. When curved in the vertical position, the girder shall be
 braced or supported in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally
 during the heat- curving process will not cause the girder to overturn.
 
 When curved in the horizontal position, the girder must be supported near its ends and at
 intermediate points, if required, to obtain a uniform curvature. The bending stress in the
 flanges due to the dead weight of the girder must not exceed the usual allowable design
 stress. When the girder is positioned horizontally for heating, intermediate safety catch
 blocks must be maintained at the mid-length of the girder within two inches of the flanges
 
 1023
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange
 buckling.
 810.02.6.4--Sequence of Operations. The girder shall be heat curved in the fabrication
 shop before it is painted. The heat curving operation may be conducted either before or
 after all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed. However,
 unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage, connection plates and bearing stiffeners
 shall be located and attached after heat curving. If longitudinal stiffeners are required, they
 shall be heat curved or oxygen cut separately and then welded to the curved girder. When
 cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams, they may be attached before heat curving
 if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than 2½ inches and the radius of
 curvature is greater than 1000 feet. For other rolled beams with cover plates, the beams
 must be heat-curved before the cover plates are attached. Cover plates must be either heat
 curved or oxygen cut separately and then welded to the curved beam.
 810.02.6.5--Camber. Girders shall be cambered before heat curving. Camber for rolled
 beams may be obtained by heat- cambering methods approved by the Engineer. For plate
 girders, the web shall be cut to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage
 due to cutting, welding, and heat curving. The heat-curving process may tend to change
 the vertical camber present before heating. This effect will be most pronounced when the
 top and bottom flanges are of unequal widths on a given transverse cross section. However,
 subject to the approval of the Engineer, moderate deviations from specified camber may
 be corrected by a carefully supervised application of heat.
 810.02.6.6--Measurement of Curvature and Camber. Horizontal curvature and vertical
 camber shall not be measured for final acceptance before all welding and heating
 operations are completed, and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature.
 Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the girder in the vertical position by measuring
 off-sets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by using other suitable means.
 Camber shall be checked by adequate means.
 810.02.7--Finish. Portions of work exposed to view shall be finished neatly. Shearing,
 flame cutting, and chipping shall be done carefully and accurately.
 810.02.8--Bolt Holes. All holes for bolts shall be either punched or drilled. Material
 forming parts of a member composed of not more than five thicknesses of metal may be
 punched 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts whenever the thickness of
 the material is not greater than 3/4 inch for structural steel, 5/8 inch for high strength steel,
 or 1/2 inch for quenched and tempered alloy steel, unless subpunching and reaming is
 required under Subsection 810.02.11.1.
 
 When there are more than five thicknesses or when any of the main material is thicker than
 3/4 inch for structural steel, 5/8 inch for high strength steel, or 1/2 inch for quenched and
 tempered alloy steel, all holes shall either be subdrilled or drilled full size.
 When required under Subsection 810.02.11, all holes shall be either subpunched or
 subdrilled 3/16 inch smaller and after assembling, reamed 1/16 inch larger or drilled full
 size to 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of bolts. Holes shall be subdrilled if
 thickness limitation governs.
 
 1024
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 810.02.9--Punched Holes. The diameter of the die shall not exceed the diameter of the
 punch by more than 1/16 inch. If any holes must be enlarged to admit the bolts, such holes
 shall be reamed. Holes must be clean cut without torn or ragged edges. Poor matching of
 holes will be cause for rejection.
 810.02.10--Reamed or Drilled Holes. Reamed or drilled holes shall be cylindrical,
 perpendicular to the member, and shall comply with the requirements of Subsection
 810.02.8 as to size. Where practicable, reamers shall be directed by mechanical means.
 Burrs on the outside surfaces shall be removed. Poor matching of holes will be cause for
 rejection. Reaming and drilling shall be done with twist drills. If required by the Engineer,
 assembled parts shall be taken apart for removal of burrs caused by drilling. Connecting
 parts requiring reamed or drilled holes shall be assembled and securely held while being
 reamed or drilled and shall be match marked before disassembling.
 810.02.11--Preparation of Field Connections.
 810.02.11.1--Subpunching and Reaming of Field Connections. Unless otherwise
 specified, holes in all field connections and field splices of main members of trusses,
 arches, continuous beam spans, bents, each face of towers, plate girders, and rigid frames
 shall be subpunched or subdrilled if subdrilling is required by Subsection 810.02.8, and
 subsequently reamed while assembled or to a steel template, as required by Subsection
 810.02.16.
 
 All holes for floorbeam and stringer field end connections shall be subpunched and reamed
 to a steel template or reamed while assembled.
 Reaming or drilling full size of field connection holes through a steel template shall be
 done after the template has been located with utmost care as to position and angle and
 firmly bolted in place. Templates used for reaming matching members, or the opposite
 faces of a single member, shall be exact duplicates. Templates used for connections on
 like parts or members shall be accurately located so that the parts or members are duplicates
 and require no match-marking.
 For any connection, in lieu of subpunching and reaming or subdrilling and reaming, the
 fabricator shall have the option of drilling holes full size with all thicknesses of material
 assembled in proper position.
 If additional subpunching and reaming is required, it shall be as specified on the plans.
 810.02.11.2--Numerically-Controlled Drilled Field Connections. Alternately, for any
 connection or splice designated in Subsection 810.02.11.1 in lieu of sub-sized holes and
 reaming while assembled, or drilling holes full-size while assembled, the Contractor shall
 have the option to drill bolt holes full-size in unassembled pieces and/or connections
 including templates for use with matching sub-sized and reamed holes by means of suitable
 numerically-controlled (N/C) drilling equipment subject to the specific provisions
 contained in this article.
 
 If N/C drilling equipment is used, the Engineer, unless otherwise stated in the special
 provisions or on the plans, may require the Contractor, by means of check assemblies, to
 demonstrate that this drilling procedure consistently produces holes and connections
 meeting the requirements of Subsections 810.02.13 and 810.02.16.
 
 1025
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval a detailed outline of the
 procedures proposed to be followed in accomplishing the work from initial drilling through
 check assembly, if required, to include the specific members of the structure that may be
 N/C drilled, the sizes of the holes, the location of common index and other reference points,
 composition of check assemblies, and all other pertinent information.
 Holes drilled by N/C drilling equipment shall be drilled to appropriate size either through
 individual pieces or any combination of pieces held tightly together.
 810.02.12--Accuracy of Punched and Drilled Holes. All holes punched full size,
 subpunched, or subdrilled shall be so accurately punched that after assembling, before any
 reaming is done, a cylindrical pin ⅛-inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the
 punched hole may be entered perpendicular to the face of the member, without drifting, in
 at least 75 percent of the contiguous holes in the same plane. If this requirement is not
 fulfilled, the badly punched pieces will be rejected. If any hole will not pass a pin 3/16
 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole, this will be cause for
 rejection.
 810.02.13--Accuracy of Reamed and Drilled Holes. When holes are reamed or drilled,
 85 percent of the holes in any contiguous group shall, after reaming or drilling, show no
 offset greater than 1/32 inch between adjacent thicknesses of metal.
 
 All steel templates shall have hardened steel bushings in holes accurately dimensioned
 from the center lines of the connection as inscribed on the template. The center lines shall
 be used in accurately locating the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 810.02.14--Fitting for Bolting. Surfaces of metal in contact shall be cleaned before
 assembling. The parts of a member shall be assembled, well pinned, and firmly drawn
 together with bolts before reaming is commenced. Assembled pieces shall be taken apart,
 if necessary, for the removal of burrs and shavings produced by the reaming operation.
 The member shall be free from twists, bends, and other deformation.
 
 Preparatory to the shop riveting of full-sized punched material, the rivet holes, if necessary,
 shall be spear-reamed for the admission of the rivets. The reamed holes shall not be more
 than 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the rivets.
 End connection angles, stiffener angles, and similar parts shall be carefully adjusted to
 correct position and bolted, clamped, or otherwise firmly held in place until riveted.
 Parts not completely riveted in the shop shall be secured by bolts, insofar as practicable, to
 prevent damage in shipment and handling.
 810.02.15--Unpainted Weathering Structural Steel. Unless otherwise specified,
 material designated as A709 Grade 50W and A709 HPS70W structural steel that is not to
 be painted shall be blast cleaned to remove mill scale or other substances. Blast cleaning
 shall conform to SSPC-SP6, Commercial Blast Cleaning. Care shall be taken that dents,
 scratches, gouges or identification marks will not appear on exposed surfaces. All steel is
 to remain in the unpainted condition and shall be handled so that it is kept free of all grease,
 oil, concrete, chalk marks, dirt, or any other foreign material that might affect the natural
 and uniform weathering of the steel.
 
 1026
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 Any foreign material that adheres to the steel during the fabrication or construction process
 that will inhibit the formation of the oxide film shall be removed as soon as practicable

 810.02.16--Shop Assembling.
 810.02.16.1--General. The field connections of main members of trusses, arches,
 continuous beam spans, bents, each face of towers, plate girders, and rigid frames shall be
 assembled in the shop with milled ends of compression members in full bearing, and then
 shall have their subsize holes reamed to specified size while the connections are assembled.
 Assembly shall be Full Truss or Girder Assembly unless Progressive Truss or Girder
 Assembly, Full Chord Assembly, Progressive Chord Assembly, or Special Complete
 Structure Assembly is specified in the special provisions or on the plans. Modifications to
 these assemblies may be allowed when approved in writing by the Bridge Engineer.
 
 When required on the plans, check assemblies and N/C drilled field connections shall be
 in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 810.02.16.7.
 Each assembly, including camber, alignment, accuracy of holes, and fit of milled joints,
 shall be approved by the Engineer before reaming is commenced or before an N/C drilled
 check assembly is dismantled.
 A camber diagram shall be furnished the Engineer by the Fabricator showing the camber
 at each panel point in the cases of trusses or arch ribs, and at the location of field splices
 and fractions of span length in case of continuous beam and girders or rigid frames.
 Fraction points of span lengths shall be 1/4 points minimum, 1/10 points maximum. When
 the shop assembly is full truss or girder assembly or special complete structure assembly,
 the camber diagram shall show the camber measured in assembly. When any of the other
 methods of shop assembly is used, the camber diagram shall show calculated camber.
 810.02.16.2--Full Truss or Girder Assembly. Full truss or girder assembly shall consist
 of assembling all members of each truss, arch rib, bent, tower face, continuous beam line,
 plate girder, or rigid frame at one time.
 810.02.16.3--Progressive Truss or Girder Assembly. Progressive truss or girder
 assembly shall consist of assembling initially for each truss, arch rib, bent, tower face,
 continuous beam line, plate girder, or rigid frame at least three contiguous shop sections or
 all members in at least three contiguous panels but not less than the number of panels
 associated with three contiguous chord lengths, i.e., length between field splices, and not
 less than 150 feet in the case of structures longer than 150 feet. At least one shop section
 or panel or as many panels as are associated with a chord length shall be added at the
 advancing end of the assembly before any member is removed from the rearward end, so
 that the assembled portion of the structure is never less than that specified above.
 
 1027
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 810.02.16.4--Full Chord Assembly. Full chord assembly shall consist of assembling, with
 geometric angles at the joints, the full length of each chord of each truss or open spandrel
 arch, or each leg of each bent or tower, then reaming their field connection holes while the
 members are assembled and reaming the web member connection to steel templates set at
 geometric not cambered angular relation to the chord lines.
 
 Field connection holes in web members shall be reamed to steel templates. At least one
 end of each web member shall be milled or shall be scribed normal to the longitudinal axis
 of the member and the templates at both ends of the member shall be accurately located
 from one of the milled ends or scribed lines.
 810.02.16.5--Progressive Chord Assembly. Progressive chord assembly shall consist of
 assembling contiguous chord members in the manner specified for full chord assembly and
 in the number and length specified for progressive truss or girder assembly.
 810.02.16.6--Special Complete Structure Assembly. Special complete structure
 assembly shall consist of assembling the entire structure, including the floor system. This
 procedure is ordinarily needed only for complicated structures such as those having curved
 girders, or extreme skew in combination with severe grade or camber, and will be required
 only when so indicated on the plans.
 810.02.16.7--Check Assemblies with Numerically Controlled Drilled Field
 Connections. Unless otherwise indicated, a check assembly shall be fabricated for each
 major structural type and shall consist of at least three contiguous shop sections or, in a
 truss, all members in at least three contiguous panels but not less than the number of panels
 associated with three contiguous chord lengths, i.e., length between field splices. Check
 assemblies should be based on the proposed order of erection, joints in bearings, special
 complex points, and similar considerations. Such special points could be the portals of
 skewed trusses, etc.
 
 Use of either geometric angles, giving theoretically zero secondary stresses under deadload conditions after erection, or cambered angles, giving theoretically zero secondary
 stresses under no-load conditions, should be designated on the plans or in the special
 provisions.
 The check assemblies shall preferably be the first such section of each major structural type
 to be fabricated.
 No match-marking and no shop assemblies other than the check assemblies will be
 required.
 If the check assembly fails in some specific manner to demonstrate that the required
 accuracy is being obtained, further check assemblies may be required by the Engineer, for
 which there shall be no additional cost to the State.
 810.02.17--Drifting of Holes. The drifting done during assembling shall be only such as
 to bring the parts into position and not sufficient to enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
 If any holes must be enlarged to admit the rivets, they shall be reamed.
 
 1028
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 810.02.18--Match-Marking. Connecting parts assembled in the shop for the purpose of
 reaming holes in field connections shall be match-marked, and a diagram showing such
 marks shall be furnished to the Engineer.
 810.02.19--Blank.
 810.02.20--Bolts and Bolted Connections. Bolted connections fabricated using high
 strength bolts shall conform to Subsection 810.02.21.
 810.02.20.1--General. Bolts shall be unfinished, turned, or ribbed bolts conforming to the
 requirements for Grade A Bolts of Specification for Low-Carbon Steel Externally and
 Internally Threaded Standard Fasteners, ASTM A 307. Bolted connections shall be used
 only as indicated by the plans or special provisions. Bolts shall have single self-locking
 nuts or double nuts unless otherwise shown on the plans or in the special provisions.
 Beveled washers shall be used where bearing faces have a slope of more than 1:20 with
 respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.
 810.02.20.2--Unfinished Bolts. Unfinished bolts shall be furnished unless other types are
 specified.
 810.02.20.3--Turned Bolts. The surface of the body of turned bolts shall meet the ANSI
 roughness rating value of 125. Heads and nuts shall be hexagonal with standard
 dimensions for bolts of the nominal size specified or the next larger nominal size. Diameter
 of threads shall be equal to the body of the bolt or the nominal diameter of the bolt
 specified. Holes for turned bolts shall be carefully reamed with bolts furnished to provide
 for a light driving fit. Threads shall be entirely outside of the holes. A washer shall be
 provided under the nut.
 810.02.20.4--Ribbed Bolts. The body of ribbed bolts shall be of an approved form with
 continuous longitudinal ribs. The diameter of the body measured on a circle through the
 points of the ribs shall be 5/64 inch greater than the nominal diameter specified for the
 bolts.
 
 Ribbed bolts shall be furnished with round heads conforming to ANSI B 18.5 unless
 otherwise specified. Nuts shall be hexagonal, either recessed or with a washer of suitable
 thickness. Ribbed bolts shall make a driving fit with the holes. The hardness of the ribs
 shall be such that the ribs do not mash down enough to permit the bolts to turn in the holes
 during tightening. If for any reason the bolt twists before drawing tight, the hole shall be
 carefully reamed and an oversized bolt used as a replacement.
 810.02.21--Connections Using High Strength Bolts. This subsection covers the
 assembly of structural joints using ASTM A 325 high strength bolts for structural steel
 joints or ASTM A 490 quenched and tempered alloy bolts for structural steel joints, or
 equivalent fasteners, tightened to a high tension. The bolts are used in holes conforming
 to the requirements of Subsections 810.02.8, 810.02.9 and 810.02.10.
 810.02.21.1--Bolts, Nuts, Washers and Direct Tension Indicators (DTI). All bolts,
 nuts, washers and DTI shall conform to the requirements of Section 717 for such items.
 
 1029
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, all threaded bolts shall be of sufficient length to
 provide at least full-thread engagement, as defined in Subsection 810.04.4, immediately
 prior to final tensioning.
 All markings on bolts, nuts, washers and DTIs must include the symbol of the manufacturer
 and not the distributor or any other trading entity. This is spelled out in all ASTM
 specifications covering these product categories. A325 bolts shall be marked "A325" and
 A490 bolts marked "A490.” Type 1 A325 bolts shall be marked with three radial lines
 120° apart. Type 3 A325 bolts shall have A325 underlined plus other distinguishing marks
 indicating that the bolt is atmospheric corrosion resistant and of a weathering type. Type
 2 A325 bolts shall be marked with three radial lines 60° apart. DTIs shall also be marked
 "325" in the case of Type "325" or "490".

 head and nut shall not exceed 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Bolted
 parts shall fit solidly together when assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or any
 other interposed compressible material.
 
 When assembled, all joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the bolt heads, nuts, or
 washers, shall be free of scale, except tight mill scale, and shall also be free of dirt, loose
 scale, burrs, other foreign material, and other defects that would prevent solid seating of
 the parts. Paint is permitted in bearing-type connections.
 Contact surfaces within friction-type joints shall be free of oil, paint, lacquer or other
 coatings, except as listed below:
 a.
 
 b.
 
 Hot dip galvanizing, if contact surfaces are scored by wire brushing or blasting
 after galvanizing and prior to assembly. The wire brushing treatment shall be a
 light application of manual brushing, not power wire brushing, that marks or
 scores the surface but removes relatively little of the zinc coating. The blasting
 treatment shall be a light "brush-off" treatment that will produce a dull gray
 appearance. However, neither treatment should be severe enough to produce any
 break or discontinuity in the zinc surface.
 Inorganic zinc rich paints as specified in Subsection 710.03.
 
 ASTM A 325 Type 2 and ASTM A 490 bolts shall not be galvanized nor shall they be used
 to connect galvanized material.

 The rotational-capacity test described in Subsection 717.02.3.4 shall be performed on each
 rotational-capacity lot prior to the start of bolt installation. Hardened steel washers are
 required as part of the test although they may not be required in the actual installation
 procedure.
 A Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or an equivalent tension measuring device shall be
 required at each job site during erection. Periodic testing, at least one each working day
 when the calibrated wrench method is used, shall be performed to assure compliance with
 the installation requirements for calibrated wrench tightening, turn-of nut tightening or DTI
 tightening.
 The Contractor shall provide all wrenches necessary for obtaining the specified bolt
 tension, and shall also provide, at no additional costs to the State, the necessary inspection
 wrenches and provisions for calibration of such wrenches as specified in this subsection
 and in Subsection 810.03.2.
 Threaded bolts shall be checked for tension with properly calibrated wrenches, by the turnof-nut method, or by the use of DTIs. When required because of bolt entering and wrench
 operating clearances, tightening may be accomplished by turning the bolt while the nut is
 prevented from rotating, provided the requirements of Subsections 810.03.1.2 and
 810.03.1.5 are met.
 Impact wrenches, if used, shall be of adequate capacity and sufficiently supplied with air
 to perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately 10 seconds.
 ASTM A490 and galvanized ASTM A325 bolts shall not be reused. Other ASTM A325
 bolts may be reused, but not more than once, if approved by the Engineer. Retightening
 previously tightened bolts that may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts
 shall not be considered as a reuse.
 Galvanized nuts shall be checked to verify that a visible lubricant is on the threads. Black
 bolts shall be "oily" to the touch when delivered and installed. Weathered or rusted bolts
 and nuts shall be cleaned and re-lubricated prior to installation. When required, bolt, nut
 and washer combinations as installed shall be from the same rotational-capacity lot,
 reference Subsection 717.02.
 810.03.1.2--Washers. All fasteners shall have a hardened washer under the element (nut
 or bolt head) turned in tightening except that ASTM A325 bolts installed by the turn of the
 
 1031
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 nut method in holes that are not oversize or slotted may have the washer omitted. Hardened
 washers shall be used under both the head and nut regardless of the element turned in the
 case of ASTM A490 bolts if the material against which it bears has a specified yield
 strength less than 40 ksi. When ASTM A 490 bolts over one inch in diameter are used in
 conjunction with short slotted or oversized holes, the hardened washers shall be at least
 5/16 inch thick.
 Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a
 plane normal to the bolt axis, a smooth beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the
 lack of parallelism.
 810.03.1.3--Calibrated Wrench Tightening. When calibrated wrenches are used to
 provide the bolt tension specified in Subsection 810.03.1.1, their setting shall be such as to
 induce a bolt tension five percent to ten percent in excess of this value. These wrenches
 shall be calibrated at least once each working day by tightening, in a device capable of
 indicating actual bolt tension, not less than three typical bolts of each diameter to be
 installed. Power wrenches shall be adjusted to stall or cut-out at the selected tension. If
 manual torque wrenches are used, the torque indication corresponding to the calibrating
 tension shall be noted and used in the installation of all bolts of the tested lot. Nuts shall
 be in the tightening direction when torque is measured. When using calibrated wrenches
 to install several bolts in a single joint, the wrench shall be returned to "touch up" bolts
 previously tightened, which may have been loosened by the tightening of subsequent bolts,
 until all are tightened to the specified tension.
 
 The required torque for calibrated wrenches may be approximated by the following
 formula:
 T (inch-pounds) = 0.2 x Bolt Diameter (inches) x Bolt Tension (pounds)
 810.03.1.4--Turn-of-Nut Tightening. When the turn-of-nut method is used to provide the
 bolt tension specified in Subsection 810.03.1.1, there shall first be enough bolts brought to
 a "snug tight" condition to ensure that the parts of the joint are brought into full contact
 with each other. "Snug tight" is defined as the initial tightening of the nut such that a load
 in the bolt of not less than 10% of the specified proof load for each type and size bolt used
 is produced. Following this initial operation, bolts shall be placed in the remaining holes
 in the connection and brought to snug tightness. All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened
 additionally by the applicable nut rotation specified in the following table with tightening
 progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges. During
 this operation there shall be no rotation of the part not turned by the wrench.

 810.03.1.5--Direct Tension Indicators Tightening. When DTI are required on the plans,
 the Contractor shall furnish a copy of the manufacturer's written installation instructions to
 the Bridge Engineer for approval prior to beginning work.
 
 It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to have a manufacturer's representative on the job
 site during initial installation of bolted connections to instruct personnel on the correct
 method of installation and inspection of the DTI.
 The DTI shall be installed and the bolts tightened in strict accordance with the
 manufacturer's written instruction. The DTI are in addition to washers required by the
 plans and Standard Specifications.
 DTI protrusions for all installations shall bear against a hardened unturned surface,
 normally either the underside of the bolt head or a hardened washer, and never directly
 against the turned element.
 Prior to the final tightening of all high strength bolts, all the plies of steel shall be drawn
 together by partially compressing DTI protrusions to ensure "snug tight" conditions. The
 final tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free
 edges until the DTI on all bolts are closed to 0.005 inch.
 DTI shall not be reused. If it becomes necessary to loosen a bolt previously tensioned, the
 DTI shall be discarded and replaced.
 
 1033
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 Bolts shall be of sufficient length to accommodate an indicator and washers made
 necessary by its use.
 The Contractor shall furnish a Skidmore-Wilhelm device or approved equal capable of
 measuring actual bolt tension. At least three typical bolts and DTIs shall be tightened in a
 device capable of determining their performance characteristics prior to the start of bolt
 placement. The device shall be made available thereafter during bolt placement for similar
 checks not to exceed intervals of one week unless directed otherwise by the Bridge
 Engineer.
 High strength bolts, nuts, washers, and DTIs shall be shipped to the project site in sealed
 metal containers or an approved equal. They shall be stored out of the weather in a location
 approved by the Engineer. The containers shall remain unopened until the contents are
 needed for erection. Bolts that, before use, have been exposed and become dried out or
 rusty will be rejected and will not be used until they are cleaned and lubricated.
 810.03.1.6--Lock-Pin and Collar Fasteners. The installation of lock-pin and collar
 fasteners shall be by methods and procedures approved by the Engineer.
 810.03.2--Inspection. The Engineer will observe the installation and tightening of bolts
 to determine that the selected tightening procedure is properly used and will determine that
 all bolts are tightened. When the calibrated wrench method of tightening is used, the
 Engineer will have full opportunity to witness the calibration tests prescribed in Subsection
 810.03.1.3.
 
 The following inspection shall be used unless a more extensive or different inspection
 procedure is specified.
 810.03.2.1--Inspecting Wrench. Either the Engineer, or the Contractor in the presence of
 the Engineer, shall use an inspecting wrench that may be either a torque wrench or a power
 wrench that can be accurately adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Subsection
 810.03.1.3.
 810.03.2.2--Calibration Device. Three bolts of the same grade, size and conditions as
 those under inspection shall be placed individually in a calibration device capable of
 indicating bolt tension. The length of the bolt may be any length representative of bolts
 used in the structure. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt.
 810.03.2.3--Torque Wrench. When the inspecting wrench is a torque wrench, each bolt
 specified in Subsection 810.03.2.2 shall be tightened in the calibration device by any
 convenient means to the minimum tension specified for its size in Subsection 810.03.1.1.
 The inspecting wrench then shall be applied to the tightened bolt and the torque necessary
 to turn the nut or head five degrees, approximately one inch at 12-inch radius, in the
 tightening direction shall be determined. The average torque measured in the tests of three
 bolts shall be taken as the job inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in
 Subsection 810.03.2.5.
 810.03.2.4--Power Wrench. When the inspecting wrench is a power wrench it shall be
 adjusted so that it will tighten each bolt specified in Subsection 810.03.2.2 to a tension at
 least five but not more than ten percent greater than the minimum tension specified for its
 
 1034
 
 Section 810
 
 Section 810
 
 size in Subsection 810.03.1.1. This setting of wrench shall be taken as the job inspecting
 torque to be used in the manner specified in the following subsection.
 810.03.2.5--Bolts. Bolts represented by the sample prescribed in Subsection 810.03.2.2
 that have been tightened in the structure shall be inspected by applying, in the tightening
 direction, the inspecting wrench and its job inspecting torque to ten percent of the bolts,
 but not less than two bolts, selected at random in each connection. If no nut or bolt head
 is turned by this application of the job inspecting torque, the connection shall be accepted
 as properly tightened. If any nut or bolt head is turned by the application of the job
 inspecting torque, this torque shall be applied to all bolts in the connection, and all bolts
 whose nut or head is turned by the job inspecting torque shall be tightened and re-inspected,
 or alternatively, the fabricator or erector, at no additional cost to the State, may re-tighten
 all of the bolts in the connection in the manner required and subject to the limitations
 imposed for the initial tightening and then resubmit the connection for the specified
 inspection.
 810.03.2.6--Direct Tension Indicators. When DTIs are used, the Department's inspector
 will check for correct tensioning by inserting a correct-thickness pointed feeler gage into
 the opening between adjacent flattened protrusions in accordance with the manufacturer's
 instructions and Subsection 810.03.1.5. At least ten percent, but no less than two, of the
 bolts in each connection will be examined.
 
 A nil gap on ASTM A325 bolts is not cause for rejection. A nil gap for ASTM A490 bolts
 is not allowed.
 810.03.2.7--Lock-pin and Collar Fasteners. The procedures for inspecting and testing
 the lock-pin and collar fasteners and their installation to ensure that the required pre-load
 tension is provided shall be as approved by the Engineer.

 810.03.23--Facilities for Inspection. The Contractor shall furnish facilities for the
 inspection of material and workmanship in the mill and shop, and the inspectors shall be
 allowed free access to the necessary parts of the works.
 
 Inspection at the mill and shop is intended as a means of facilitating the work and avoiding
 errors, and it is expressly understood that it will not relieve the Contractor from any
 responsibility in regard to imperfect material or workmanship and the necessity for
 replacing same.
 810.03.24--Inspector's Authority. Inspectors shall have the authority to reject any
 material or work that does not meet the requirements of the specifications. In case of
 dispute, the Contractor may appeal to the Engineer, whose decision shall be final.
 
 The acceptance of any material or finished members by the inspector shall not be a bar to
 their subsequent rejection, if found defective. Rejected material and workmanship shall be
 replaced promptly or made good by the Contractor.
 Material and workmanship not previously inspected will be inspected after its delivery to
 the site of the work.

 approval of the working drawings cover the requirements for "strength and detail" and that
 the Engineer assumes no responsibility for errors in dimensions.
 810.03.25.2--Identification of Steels During Fabrication.
 810.03.25.2.1--Identification by Contractor. The Engineer shall be furnished with four
 complete copies of certified mill test reports showing chemical analysis and physical tests
 for each heat of steel for all members, unless excepted by the Engineer. Each piece of steel
 to be fabricated shall be properly identified for the Engineer.
 
 Shop drawings shall specifically identify each piece that is to be made of steel other than
 ASTM A709 Grade 50/50W. Pieces made of different grades of steel shall not be given
 the same assembling or erecting mark, even though they are of identical dimensions and
 detail.
 The Contractor's system of assembly-marking individual pieces, required to be made of
 steel other than ASTM A709 Grade 50/50W, and the issuance of cutting instructions to the
 shop, generally by cross-referencing of the assembly-marks shown on the shop drawings
 with the corresponding item covered on the mill purchase order, shall be such as to maintain
 identity of the mill test report number.

 shall show clearly and legibly its specification identification color code shown in the table
 below.
 
 Individually marked pieces of steel that are used in furnished size, or reduced from
 furnished size only by end or edge trim and do not disturb the heat number or color code
 or leave any usable piece, may be used without further color coding provided that the heat
 number or color code remains legible.
 Pieces of steel, other than ASTM A709 Grade 50/50W, that are to be cut to smaller size
 pieces shall, before cutting, be legibly marked with the ASTM A6 specification
 identification color code.
 Individual pieces of steel, other than ASTM A709 Grade 50/50W, that are furnished in
 tagged lifts or bundles shall be marked with the ASTM A6 specification identification color
 code immediately upon being removed from the bundle or lift.
 Pieces of steel, other than ASTM A36, that, prior to assembling into members, will be
 subject to fabricating operations such as blast cleaning, galvanizing, heating for forming,
 or painting that might obliterate paint color code marking shall be marked for grade by
 steel die stamping or by a substantial tag firmly attached.

 application subject to approval of the Engineer.
 810.03.28.10--Assembling Steel. The parts shall be accurately assembled as shown on the
 plans and any match-marks shall be followed. The material shall be carefully handled so
 that no parts will be bent, broken, or otherwise damaged. Hammering that will injure or
 distort the members shall not be done. Bearing surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent
 contact shall be cleaned before the members are assembled. Unless erected by the
 cantilever method, truss spans shall be erected on blocking so as to give the trusses proper
 camber. The blocking shall be left in place until the tension chord splices are fully bolted
 and all other truss connections pinned and bolted. Permanent bolts in splices of butt joints
 of compression members and permanent bolts in railings shall not be driven or tightened
 until the span has been swung. Splices and field connections shall have one half of the
 holes filled with bolts and cylindrical erection pins, half bolts and half pins, before bolting
 with high strength bolts. Splices and connections carrying traffic during erection shall have
 three-fourths of the holes so filled.
 810.03.28.11--Blank.
 810.03.28.12--Pin Connections. Pilot and driving nuts shall be used in driving pins. They
 shall be furnished by the Contractor without charge. Pins shall be so driven that the
 members will take full bearing on them. Pin nuts shall be screwed up tight and the threads
 burred at the face of the nut with a pointed tool.
 810.03.28.13--Misfits. The correction of minor misfits involving harmless amounts of
 reaming, cutting and chipping will be considered a legitimate part of the erection. However,
 any error in the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and transportation
 that prevents the proper assembling and fitting up of parts by the moderate use of drift pins
 or by a moderate amount of reaming and slight chipping or cutting shall be reported
 immediately to the inspector. The method of correction shall require approval by the
 inspector in whose presence the correction will be made. If the contract provides for
 complete fabrication and erection, the Contractor shall be responsible for all misfits, errors,
 and injury and shall make the necessary corrections and replacements. If the contract is
 
 1044
 
 Section 810

 be removed by the Contractor before final acceptance.
 810.04--Method of Measurement.
 810.04.1--General. The steel superstructure will be measured as a lump sum quantity,
 complete in place. Structural steel will be measured for payment by the pound based on
 the weight of metal in the fabricated structure as provided in the contract.
 
 Miscellaneous material items such as castings, bearing plates, lead sheets, anchor bolts,
 and all other metal for which no direct payment is specified and the contract proposal does
 not include a bid item for miscellaneous bridge appurtenances will be included in the
 measurement for structural steel except when the plans and specifications provide that
 payment will not be allowed for certain materials. When DTIs are not required by the
 contract and the Contractor elects to use such indicators, no measure for payment will be
 allowed.
 810.04.2--Miscellaneous Bridge Appurtenances. When the bid schedule of the contract
 contains a pay item for Miscellaneous Bridge Appurtenances, measurement will not be
 made of individual miscellaneous items, but all will be included in a single lump sum
 quantity, including all miscellaneous metals and other miscellaneous materials and work
 not specified to be measured for payment under or to be included in other items of work.
 810.04.3--Payment of Weights.
 
 Weights of metals to be paid for shall be based on computed weights.
 The weights of erection bolts, extra field rivets or high strength bolts, paint, and all boxes,
 crates, or other containers used for packing, together with sills, struts, and rods used for
 supporting members during transportation will be excluded. All metals not to remain in
 the completed structure will not be computed for payment.
 Where increases in size or weights of members have been made that were not ordered by
 the Engineer, but approved by him, measurement will be made on the sizes or weights
 indicated on the plans.
 Full size members tested as required under Subsection 810.03.26 and that meet the
 requirements of these specifications will be measured for payment at the same rate as for
 the structure.
 
 1045
 
 Section 810

 The weight of weld metal will be computed on the basis of the theoretical volume from
 dimensions of the welds.
 810.04.5--Deduction for Fabrication Inspection Cost Overruns. Under separate
 agreement, the Department will contract with a private company to provide inspection
 services for structural steel fabrication on the project. By this agreement a maximum
 amount payable, including a fixed fee will be established beyond which no funds will be
 authorized for payment without a Supplemental Agreement.
 
 The Department will be responsible for structural steel fabrication inspection costs not to
 exceed the established maximum amount payable including the fixed fee and any
 additional amount authorized for payment by Supplemental Agreement.
 Structural steel fabrication inspection costs exceeding the above described amount will be
 deducted from monies due the Contractor under pay items 810-A, Structural Steel; 810-B,
 Steel Superstructure, and/or 810-C, Miscellaneous Bridge Appurtenances.
 Ninety percent (90%) of the amount bid for structural steel items listed above will be the
 maximum amount paid the Contractor until such time that final fabrication inspection costs
 have been determined and the Bridge Engineer notifies the Project Engineer to release full
 payment to the Contractor. Otherwise, the Bridge Engineer will advise the Project
 Engineer of the amount to withhold from the Contractor’s estimate to cover structural steel
 fabrication inspection costs that exceed the amount approved for payment by the
 Department.
 810.05--Basis of Payment. Structural steel, subject to the deductions set out in Subsection
 810.04.5, will be paid for at the contract unit price per pound. Steel superstructure and
 miscellaneous bridge appurtenances when shown as a pay item will be paid for at the

 shall it be applied in rain, snow, wind, fog, mist or when, in the opinion of the Engineer,
 conditions are otherwise unsatisfactory for the work.
 816.03.2--Pollution Control During Surface Preparation And Repainting. Generated
 debris must be confined to the immediate area of the structure. Appropriate screens and
 barriers must be erected to protect pedestrian and vehicular traffic during waterblasting and
 painting operation. Overspray must be kept to a bare minimum.
 816.03.3--Surface Preparation. Surface preparation will include waterblasting the entire
 surface followed by spot cleaning with hand tools to remove any remaining loose or flaking
 paint or rust, dirt, oil, grease and/or other deleterious matter from the steel surface. Tightly
 bonded paint is not to be removed and it is not necessary to remove tightly bonded rust.
 
 In areas containing a heavy coating of oil, grease and/or deleterious material that cannot be
 cleaned by waterblasting, cleaning shall be performed using an environmentally sensitive
 biodegradable solvent. Brush or mop the solvent on the surface with a rubbing action to
 loosen the film. Wipe off with a clean dry cloth and then rinse by waterblasting. Repeat
 as necessary until clean. The cleanliness of the surface shall be approved by the Project
 Engineer or a designated representative prior to beginning painting operations.
 816.03.3.1--Waterblasting. The waterblasting unit must be capable of operating at
 pressures up to 4,000 psi at a water flow rate up to 10 gpm. The unit must be equipped
 
 1064
 
 Section 816
 
 Section 816
 
 with a water filter, pressure gauge, nozzle with 1/8-inch orifice or one that will provide a
 jet stream of water, and sufficient length of hydraulic hose. The unit shall be equipped
 with a deadman control valve or other control valves that will provide automatic shut-off
 by release of the trigger. Water for blasting must be potable water to prevent damage to
 the pump and to ensure a clean surface on the steel. During waterblasting operation, wood,
 insulation, electrical, instrumentation, etc., must be protected. After waterblasting, remove
 any remaining loose paint, loose rust and rust scale with wire brushes or other methods as
 necessary. Using the waterblast unit or compressed air, remove the loose debris generated
 from the hand tool cleaning operation. To prevent recontamination of the steel surface, the
 surface preparation operation should not be completed more than eight hours in advance
 of the painting operation. Should any recontamination occur prior to painting, repeat
 surface preparation procedures as necessary for removal. Before painting, the surfaces
 must be clean and dry. To enhance drying of the surfaces, compressed air may be used.
 816.03.3.2--Safety and Clean-Up. During the cleaning of the existing steel, the
 Contractor may encounter hazardous material. The Contractor will be responsible for the
 health and safety of employees and shall provide such items as protective clothing and
 respirators and make certain that they are used. The Contractor shall also be responsible
 for the maintenance and/or replacement of these items. The Contractor is advised that
 safety precautions for workers during each phase of work shall be in compliance with
 present OSHA standards.
 
 The Contractor shall take necessary precautions to prevent an excessive amount of
 removed materials from falling beneath the structure. General debris must be confined to
 the immediate area of the structure. Appropriate measures shall be taken to protect the
 traveling public during surface preparation and painting operations.
 The Contractor shall clean the area of excessive debris generated from cleaning and
 properly dispose of it at an approved landfill.
 The Contractor shall take necessary steps to become familiar with any applicable Federal,
 State or local regulations and take the necessary actions for compliance when applicable to
 any portion of the required work.
 816.03.4--Packaging and Marking. Multiple component paints shall be furnished in
 premeasured packages so as to form one unit of mixed paint when mixed with the vehicle
 in its container.
 
 The containers for all paints shall be coated as necessary to prevent attack by the paint.
 Each container shall bear a label with the following information shown thereon: name and
 address of manufacturer, trade mark or trade name, kind of paint, date of manufacture and
 lot number, mixing instructions and equipment clean up instructions. The VOC content
 shall be stated either on the label, product data sheet, or Material Safety Data Sheet.
 816.03.5--Acceptance Procedure. Prior to use, the Contractor must furnish the Engineer
 a certificate from the manufacturer, covering each lot of paint in the shipment, attesting
 that the paint in the shipment conforms to the same formula as that originally approved by
 the Department.
 
 1065
 
 Section 816
 
 Section 816
 
 Final acceptance of the paint will be based on results of tests performed by the Central
 Laboratory on samples obtained by the Department's representative prior to or after
 delivery. The use of any lot of paint prior to its final acceptance shall be prohibited.
 816.03.6--Mixing, Thinning and Application. All paint shall be mixed and applied in
 accordance with the manufacturer's printed instructions. Paint shall be thinned only under
 conditions that strictly follow the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 At the Engineer's request, the paint manufacturer's technical representative, who is certified
 by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE), shall be present at the job
 site at the beginning of each separate coating operation to provide technical expertise in
 the application of the field coats. This technical expertise shall be provided without
 additional cost to the Department. The Contractor shall be responsible for arranging for
 the presence of the manufacturer's technical representative.
 The Contractor must apply the paint to the Wet Film Thickness (WFT) that will obtain the
 Dry Film Thickness (DFT) required for the film being applied. The DFT required for each
 paint film of each approved coating system is set out in the Department's Approved List of
 Materials.
 A subsequent coat shall not be applied until the previous coat has dried throughout the film
 thickness.
 To secure a maximum coating on edges of plates or shapes, rivets, bolt heads and other
 parts subjected to special wear and attack, the edges shall be stripped with a longitudinal
 motion and the rivets and bolt heads with a rotary motion of a brush followed immediately
 by general painting of the whole surface, including recoating of the edges, rivets and bolt
 heads.
 If, in the opinion of the Engineer, traffic produces an objectionable amount of dust, the
 Contractor shall, at no additional costs to the State, allay the dust for the necessary distance
 on each side of the bridge and take any other precautions necessary to prevent dust and dirt
 from coming in contact with freshly painted surfaces or surfaces prepared for painting.
 The Contractor shall protect pedestrian, vehicular and other traffic upon or underneath the
 bridge and all portions of the bridge superstructure and substructure against damage or
 disfigurement by splatters, splashes and smirches of paint or paint material. Any such
 disfigurement shall be removed at the direction of and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 816.03.7--Inspection. The Contractor shall measure the paint thickness with an elcometer
 or other approved magnetic detector thickness gauges. All areas of the finished system
 deficient in thickness shall be coated over with the finish paint to establish the specified
 thickness. Excessive thickness in the application of either coating evidenced by
 mudcracking will be cause for the affected area to be stripped of paint, cleaned and
 repainted.
 
 Where rejection is due to poor workmanship or deficiency in the quality of the work or
 materials, the Contractor may be required to strip the entire defective sections of all
 previously applied materials and clean prior to repainting.
 Inspection shall be done in the presence of and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

 820.03.1--Storage of Material. Lumber and timber stored on the site shall be kept in
 orderly piles or stacks. Untreated material shall be open-stacked on supports at least 12
 inches above the ground surface to avoid absorption of ground moisture and to permit air
 circulation, and it shall be so stacked and stripped as to permit free circulation of air
 between the tiers and courses. It will be advisable in particular cases for the Engineer to
 require protection from the weather by a suitable covering. On glued laminated structural
 members that are not to be treated, an approved end sealer shall be applied after end
 trimming of each completed member.
 820.03.2--Installing Timber Piling.
 820.03.2.1--Driving Piling. Timber piles shall be driven in accordance with the
 requirements of Subsection 803.03.1.7, except as modified herein.

 1068
 
 Section 820
 
 Section 820
 
 820.03.4.2--Placement. All cutting, framing, and boring of treated timber shall be done
 before treatment insofar as practicable. When treated timbers are to be placed in waters
 infected by marine borers, untreated cuts, borings, or other joint framings below high water
 elevation shall be avoided.
 820.03.4.3--Cuts and Abrasions. All cuts in treated piles or timbers, and all abrasions,
 after having been carefully trimmed, shall be covered with two applications of a mixture
 of 60 percent creosote oil and 40 percent roofing pitch, or brush coated with at least two
 applications of hot creosote oil and covered with hot roofing pitch.
 820.03.4.4--Bolt Holes. All bolt holes bored after treatment shall be treated with creosote
 oil by means of an approved pressure bolt hole treater. Any unfilled holes, after being
 treated with creosote oil, shall be plugged with creosoted plugs.
 820.03.4.5--Temporary Attachment. Whenever, with the approval of the Engineer,
 forms or temporary braces are attached to treated timber with nails or spikes, the holes shall
 be filled by driving galvanized nails or spikes flush with the surface or plugging holes as
 required for bolt holes.
 820.03.5--Untreated Timber. In temporary structures of untreated timber, the following
 surfaces shall be thoroughly coated with two coats of hot creosote oil before assembling:
 ends, tops, and all contact surfaces of sills, caps, floor beams, and stringers; and all ends,
 joints, and contact surfaces of bracing and truss members. The back faces of bulkheads
 and all other timber that is to be in contact with earth, metal or other timber shall be
 similarly treated.
 
 Bolts passing through non-resinous wood shall be galvanized.
 820.03.6--Treatment of Pile Heads. The heads of treated timber piles shall be protected
 as specified on the plans. If not specified, the fabric covering shall be used. The heads of
 timber piles, when the nature of the driving will unduly injure them, shall be protected by
 driving caps. When the area of the head of a timber pile is greater than that of the face of
 the pile hammer, a suitable cap shall be provided to distribute the blow of the hammer
 throughout the cross section of the pile. Fresh heading of a timber pile is recommended
 prior to driving. The head shall be cut square and shall be shaped or chamfered to prevent
 splitting at its periphery. Heads of all piling shall be square and a driving cap shall be
 provided to hold the axis of the pile in line with the axis of the hammer.
 820.03.6.1--Cutting Off of Timber Piles. The tops of all piling shall be sawed to a true
 plane, as shown on the plans, and at the elevation fixed by the Engineer. Piles that support
 timber caps or grillage shall be sawed to conform to the plane of the bottom of the
 superimposed structure. In general, the length of pile above the cut-off elevation shall be
 sufficient to permit the complete removal of all material injured by driving, but piles driven
 to very nearly the cut-off elevation shall be carefully adzed or otherwise freed from all
 broomed, splintered or otherwise injured material. Pile heads, after cutting to receive the
 caps and prior to placing the caps, shall be treated in accordance with Subsection 820.03.6.

 four inches outside of the pile, and it shall be bent down, neatly trimmed and securely
 fastened to the face of the pile with large headed galvanized roofing nails.
 820.03.6.4--Fabric Covering. The heads of all piles shall be covered with alternate layers
 of hot pitch and loosely woven fabric similar to membrane waterproofing, using four
 applications of pitch and three layers of fabric. The cover shall measure at least six inches
 more in dimensions that the diameter of the pile and shall be neatly folded down over the
 pile and secured by large headed galvanized nails or by binding or serving with not less
 than seven complete turns of galvanized wire securely held in place by large-headed
 galvanized nails and staples. The edges of the fabric projecting below the wire wrapping
 shall be trimmed to present a workmanlike appearance.
 
 The heads of untreated piles shall be given one of the following treatments, as may be
 specified or directed by the Engineer:
 (a) The sawed surface shall be thoroughly brush-coated with two applications of hot
 creosote oil.
 (b) The sawed surface shall be heavily coated with paint, after which it shall be
 covered with cotton duck of a least eight-ounce weight, which shall be folded
 down over the sides of the pile and firmly secured thereto with large-headed
 roofing nails. The edges of the duck shall be trimmed to give a workmanlike
 appearance. The duck shall then be waterproofed by being thoroughly saturated
 and coated with one or more applications of red lead paint.
 820.03.7--Holes for Bolts, Dowels, Rods and Lag Screws. Holes for round drift bolts
 and dowels shall be bored with a bit 1/16 inch less in diameter than the bolt or dowel to be
 used. The diameter of holes for square drift bolts or dowels shall be equal to the least
 dimension of the bolt or dowel.
 
 Holes for machine bolts shall be bored with a bit the same diameter as the bolt, except as
 otherwise provided in Subsection 820.03.3.
