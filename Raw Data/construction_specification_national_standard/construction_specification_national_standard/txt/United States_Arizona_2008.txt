 Partnering will be structured to draw on the strengths of each
 organization to identify and achieve reciprocal goals. The objectives
 are effective and efficient contract performance and completion within
 budget, on schedule, and in accordance with the contract.
 The establishment of a partnering charter on a project will not change
 the legal relationship of the parties to the contract nor relieve either
 party from any of the terms of the contract.
 Any cost associated with effectuating partnering will be agreed to by
 the Department and the contractor and will be shared equally between
 them.
 To implement this partnering initiative prior to starting of work in
 accordance with the requirements of Subsection 108.02 and prior to the
 preconstruction conference, the contractor's management personnel
 and the District Engineer will initiate a partnering development
 seminar/team building workshop. The Department and the contractor
 will make arrangements to determine attendees at the workshop, the
 36
 
 SECTION 104
 agenda of the workshop, its duration, and its location.
 Persons
 required to be in attendance will be the Department‘s Construction
 Supervisor and key project personnel; the contractor's on-site project
 manager and key project supervision personnel of both the prime and
 principal subcontractors and suppliers. The project design engineers,
 FHW A and key local government personnel will also be invited to attend
 as necessary.
 The contractors and the Department will also be
 required to have Regional/District and Corporate/State level managers
 on the project team.
 Follow-up workshops may be held periodically throughout the duration
 of the contract as agreed by the contractor and the Department.

 Repair Work:
 
 Repair of damaged work under the provisions of this subsection shall
 be pursuant to a supplemental agreement specifying the repair work to
 be performed on the damaged facility. Repair work shall consist of
 restoring the in-place construction (for the purposes of this subsection
 erected falsework and formwork shall be considered in-place
 construction) to the same state of completion to which such work had
 advanced prior to the Occurrence. Emergency work which the Engineer
 determines would have been part of the repair work if it had not
 47
 
 SECTION 104
 previously been performed, will be considered to be part of said repair
 work. The Department reserves the right to make changes in the plans
 and specifications applicable to the portions of the work to be repaired,
 and if such changes will increase the cost of repairing the damage over
 the Engineer's estimate of the cost of repair without the changes, the
 contractor will be paid for such increased costs in accordance with
 Subsection 104.11(E).
 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve the contractor
 of full responsibility for the risk or injury, loss or damage to materials
 not yet incorporated in the work and to materials, tools, and equipment
 ( e xc e p t e r e c t e d f a l s e w o r k a n d f o r m w o r k ) u s e d t o p e r f o r m t h e w o r k , n o r

 Idled Equipment and Remobilization:
 
 Unless otherwise agreed between the Engineer and the contractor, the
 cost of the work performed pursuant to this subsection will be
 determined in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 109.04,
 “Adjustments in the Contract Price.” The cost of documented direct
 project
 costs
 including
 idled
 equipment
 at
 stand-by
 rates,
 remobilization costs, and direct project office overhead shall be
 included in the cost of emergency work. The contractor and Engineer
 will agree on equipment which is idle, inaccessible, unusable, or cannot

 (C)
 
 Conditions:
 
 Value Engineering Proposals will be considered only when all of the
 following conditions are met:
 (1) A VEP, approved or not approved by the Department,
 applies only to the contract on which it is submitted. A
 submitted VEP becomes the property of the Department.
 The VEP shall contain no restrictions imposed by the
 contractor on its use or disclosure. The Department has
 the right to use, duplicate and disclose in whole or in
 part any data necessary for the utilization of the
 Proposal. The Department retains the right to use any
 accepted VEP or part thereof on other projects without
 obligation to the contractor.
 This provision is not
 intended to deny rights provided by law with respect to
 patented materials or processes.
 (2) If the Department is already considering certain
 revisions to the contract or has considered or approved
 changes in the contract of a like nature on other
 contracts which are subsequently incorporated in a VEP,
 the Department may reject the VEP and may change the
 contract without obligation to the contractor.
 (3) The contractor shall have no claim for additional costs
 or delays resulting from the rejection of a VEP,
 including development costs, loss of anticipated profits,

 consideration and evaluation. It may reject any VEP
 t h a t r e q u i r e s e xc e s s i v e t i m e o r c o s t s f o r r e v i e w ,
 evaluation or investigation, or that is not consistent with
 the Department's design policies and criteria for the
 project.
 (5) The Engineer will reject all or any portion of work
 performed under an approved VEP if unsatisfactory
 results are obtained.
 The Engineer will direct the
 removal of rejected work and require construction to
 proceed under the original contract requirements without
 reimbursement for rejected work performed under the
 VEP, or for its removal. W here modifications to the
 VEP are approved to adjust to field or other conditions,
 reimbursement will be limited to the total amount
 payable for the work at the contract bid prices as if it
 were
 constructed
 under
 the
 original
 contract
 requirements.
 The
 rejection
 or
 limitation
 of
 reimbursement shall not constitute the basis of any
 53
 
 SECTION 104
 claim against the Department for delay or for other
 costs.

 features but shall contain features that have been used
 under similar or acceptable conditions on other projects
 or locations acceptable to the Department.
 (7) VEPs will not be considered if equivalent options are
 already provided in the contract.
 (8) The savings generated by the VEP must be sufficient to
 warrant a review and processing. A savings resulting
 solely from the elimination or reduction in quantity of a
 single bid item will not be considered as a VEP. A
 savings resulting from the elimination or reduction in
 quantity of a bid item specified as part of a VEP will be
 considered.
 (9) A VEP changing the type of the pavement structure or
 the type or basic design of a bridge structure will not be
 considered. Changes in the pavement structural section
 or in structure design details may be considered with
 prior approval by the Materials or State Bridge
 Engineer. Changes to contingency items such as traffic
 control and dust palliative will not be considered if they
 are part of pre-determined lump sum contract amounts.
 Contingency items such as traffic control and dust
 palliative may be considered when they are reduced as
 part of a VEP to change scope, method or procedure,
 provided they are specified as individual contract bid
 items.
 (10) Additional information needed to evaluate VEPs shall be
 provided in a timely manner.
 Untimely submittals of
 additional information will result in rejection of the VEP.
 W here design changes are proposed, the additional
 information could include results of field investigations
 and surveys, design computations, and field change
 sheets.
 (11) The contractor may submit VEPs for an approved
 subcontractor.
 Reimbursement will be made to the
 contractor.

 the contractor be paid 50 percent of the net savings
 amount as reflected by the difference between the cost
 of the revised work and the cost of the related
 construction required by the original contract computed
 at contract bid prices. The net savings will take into
 account the contractor’s cost of developing the VEP and
 implementing the change, and reducing this amount by
 the Department’s cost for investigating and evaluating
 55
 
 SECTION 104
 the VEP, including any ascertainable collateral costs to
 the Department.
 Such collateral costs may include
 increased costs for maintenance, operation, related
 work items, additional work items, or elements of

 and duct banks containing a utility that is not magnetically detectable,
 either before or after backfilling; and other facilities as determined by
 the Engineer.
 Cast iron and ductile iron pipes may be non-conductive because of sitespecific soil conditions or construction configuration; as a consequence
 all new installations of cast iron and ductile iron pipes shall also be
 made detectable with tracer wire.
 For all other underground facilities, should the magnetic characteristics
 be unknown, the contractor shall perform sufficient tests with standard
 locating instruments to determine whether tracer wire will be
 necessary, and provide the results to the Engineer. Such tests shall be
 performed prior to construction.
 The contractor shall also provide access points, as specified below, for
 all facilities that will receive tracer wire.

 to interpretation of the plans and specifications, alterations of the
 contract, and contractor compensation.
 The Resident Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work in
 whole or in part due to: failure of the contractor to correct conditions
 unsafe for the workers or the general public; failure to carry out
 provisions of the contract; and failure to carry out orders.
 The
 Resident Engineer may suspend the work due to adverse weather
 conditions, conditions considered adverse to the prosecution of the
 work, or any other condition or reason deemed to be in the public
 interest.
 105.03
 
 Plans and Working Drawings:
 
 The plans will show details of all structures, the lines, grades, typical
 cross sections of the roadway and the location and design of all
 structures. The contractor shall keep one set of project plans available
 at the project site at all times.
 The plans shall be supplemented by such working drawings as are
 necessary to control the work adequately. W orking drawings shall be
 furnished by the contractor and shall include such detailed plans as

 with the design intent of the contracts. Following the Engineer's review
 60
 
 SECTION 105
 of each submittal of working drawings, the Engineer shall respond in
 writing to the contractor as follows:
 (A) "APPROVED," which means approved for construction,
 fabrication or manufacture, subject to the provision that the
 work shall be in accordance with the requirements of the
 contract. Final acceptance of the work shall be contingent
 upon such compliance;
 (B) "APPROVED AS NOTED," which means unless otherwise
 noted on the drawings approved for construction, fabrication
 or manufacture, subject to the provision that the work shall
 be carried out in compliance with all annotations or
 corrections indicated and in accordance with requirements
 of the contract.
 Final acceptance of work shall be
 contingent upon such compliance.
 If also marked
 "RESUBMIT," approval as noted is valid, and a corrected
 submittal of the drawings is required; or
 (C) "DISAPPROVED," which means that deviations from the
 r e q u i r e m e n t s o f t h e c o n t r a c t e xi s t i n t h e s u b m i t t a l s u c h t h a t
 no work based on such drawings shall be constructed,
 fabricated, or manufactured. The contractor shall revise the
 drawing in compliance with the Engineer's annotations and
 pursuant to all requirements of the contract and shall
 resubmit the working drawings to the Engineer for another
 review.
 The Engineer's approval of the contractor's working drawings shall not
 relieve the contractor from responsibility for errors in dimensions, for
 successful completion of the work, or in conforming with the
 requirements of the plans and specifications nor for responsibility for
 damage claims as defined in Subsection 107.13. The contractor shall
 be responsible for the correctness of its plans and for shop fits and
 field connections, although the plans may have been approved. Any
 work done or materials ordered or delivered prior to the approval of
 such working drawings shall be at the sole risk of the contractor.
 All working drawings which are drawings or prints shall be 36 by 22
 inches in size. There shall be a two-inch margin on the left side of the
 36-inch dimension and a 1/2-inch margin on the remaining three sides.
 A blank space, four inches wide by three inches high, shall be left
 inside the margin in the lower right hand corner. All drawings shall be
 made in such a manner that clear and legible copies can be made from
 them.
 Five sets of prints or other acceptable copies and one set of positive
 reproducibles, such as positive mylars or positive sepia, shall be
 submitted to the Engineer for review. The prints and the reproducibles
 shall be clear, precise and suitable for microfilm photography. Upon
 completion of the review, the Engineer will stamp the drawings in
 accordance with item A, B, or C listed above and return one set of the
 prints to the contractor.
 Drawings requiring a resubmittal shall be
 61
 
 SECTION 105
 revised in accordance with the Engineer's annotations, after being
 verified by the contractor, and resubmitted as described above,
 including the set of positive reproducibles. This resubmittal process
 shall continue until all corrections and revisions have been made and
 are acceptable to the Engineer.
 No changes shall be made by the contractor to any working drawing
 after it has been approved by the Engineer.
 The cost of furnishing all working drawings shall be considered as
 included in the contract unit price for one or more of the contract items.
 105.04
 
 Conformity with Plans and Specifications:
 
 All work performed and all materials furnished shall be in reasonably
 close conformity to the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions and
 material requirements, including tolerances shown on the plans or
 indicated in the specifications. The Engineer will determine the limits
 of reasonably close conformity in each individual case and the
 Engineer's judgment shall be final and conclusive.
 W here specific
 provisions regarding quality control standards are set forth elsewhere
 in the contract, they shall be controlling.
 The Engineer's failure to discover or reject materials or work not in
 accordance with the contract during the progress of work shall not be
 considered an acceptance of the work or materials, or a waiver of
 defects. Neither the failure to properly perform inspections, tests or
 approvals required by the contract documents nor the activities or
 duties to the Engineer in the administration of this contract shall relieve
 the contractor from its obligation to perform the work in strict
 accordance with the contract.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials furnished, work performed
 or the finished product in which the materials are used not within
 reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications but that
 reasonably acceptable work meeting the design purpose has been
 produced, the Engineer will determine the conditions under which the
 work will be accepted and allowed to remain in place, unless there are
 other provisions in the contract that provide for this determination.
 W here this determination is made by the Engineer, rather than contract
 provisions, the Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by
 contract modification. The modification will provide for an appropriate
 adjustment in the contract price for such work or materials as
 necessary to support this determination.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials furnished, work
 performed, or the finished product in which the materials are used or
 the work performed are not in reasonably close conformity with the
 plans and specifications and have resulted in work which is not
 reasonably acceptable, the work or materials shall be removed and
 replaced or otherwise corrected by the contractor at no additional cost
 to the Department.
 62
 
 SECTION 105

 Restricted Performance Specifications:
 
 W hen the work is performed under a restricted performance
 specification, the target values specified shall be considered to be the
 values strived for and from which any deviation is allowed.
 It is the intent of the specifications that the materials and workmanship
 shall be uniform in character and shall conform as nearly as
 realistically possible to the prescribed target value or to the middle
 portion of the tolerance range. The purpose of the tolerance range is
 to accommodate occasional minor variations from the median zone that
 a r e u n a v o i d a b l e f o r p r a c t i c a l r e a s o n s . W h e n e i t h e r a m a xi m u m a n d

 the material and the performance of the work shall be so controlled that
 material or work will not be preponderantly of borderline quality or
 dimension. The Engineer will determine acceptability of materials or
 construction as outlined in the applicable sections of the specifications.
 105.06
 
 Coordination of Plans, Specifications, and Special
 Provisions:
 
 The Special Provisions, the Plans, the Standard Specifications, and all
 supplementary documents are essential parts of the contract and a
 requirement occurring in one is as binding as though occurring in all.
 They are intended to be complementary and to describe and provide for
 a complete work.
 In case of discrepancy or conflict, the order in which they govern shall
 be as follows:

 SECTION 105
 If, through the failure of the utility owners to relocate or adjust their
 facilities as provided for in the contract, the contractor sustains loss
 which could not have been avoided by the judicious handling of forces,
 equipment and plant or by reasonable revision in the contractor's
 schedule of operations, any revisions to the contract price or time will
 be provided in accordance with Subsections 104.02 and 108.08.
 105.09
 
 Cooperation Between Contractors:
 
 The Department reserves the right at any time to contract for and
 perform other or additional work on or near the work covered by the
 contract.
 W hen separate contracts are awarded within the limits of any one
 project, each contractor shall conduct its work so as not to interfere
 with or hinder the progress or completion of the work being performed
 by other contractors. Contractors working on the same project shall
 cooperate with each other as directed. If requested by the Engineer,
 each contractor shall furnish the Engineer with written evidence that
 the contractor has made the necessary arrangements with the other
 contractors for the successful prosecution of the work for the benefit of
 all parties.
 Each contractor involved shall assume all liability, financial or
 otherwise, in connection with its contract and shall protect and save
 harmless the Department from any and all damages or claims that may

 other contractors because of the presence and operations of other
 contractors working within the limits of the same project.
 The contractor shall arrange its work and shall place and dispose of the
 materials being used so as not to interfere with the operations of the
 other contractors within the limits of the same project and on adjoining
 projects. The contractor shall join the contractor's work with that of the
 others in an acceptable manner and shall perform it in proper sequence
 to that of the others.
 105.10
 
 Construction Stakes, Lines and Grades:
 
 Unless the contract provides for construction survey and layout by the
 contractor, the Engineer will set construction stakes establishing lines,
 slopes and continuous profile grade in road work and center line and
 bench marks for bridge work, culvert work, protective and accessory
 structures and appurtenances and will furnish the contractor with all
 necessary information relating to lines, slopes and grades.
 These
 stakes and marks will constitute the field control by and in accordance
 with which the contractor shall establish other necessary controls and
 perform the work.
 During the course of construction the contractor shall submit requests
 for staking. The Department will not be responsible for staking delays
 unless the Engineer is provided 10 calendar days notice before
 65
 
 SECTION 105
 beginning work on an item and thereafter 48 hours notice that stakes
 are needed.
 W hen the contractor is aware of errors or suspects that there are errors
 in the staking, the contractor shall bring them to the attention of the
 Engineer prior to beginning any work on the basis of the errors. The
 contractor shall take no advantage of any staking error.
 The contractor shall be held responsible for the preservation of all
 stakes and marks and if any of the construction stakes or marks have
 been carelessly or willfully destroyed or disturbed by the contractor,
 the cost of replacing them will be charged against it and will be
 deducted from the payment for the work.

 and Inspectors:
 
 The primary responsibility of Inspectors is to accurately document the
 work detailed in the plans and specifications. The documentation will
 include the level or degree of conformance of the work with the plans
 and specifications.
 The Inspectors are also responsible for requiring conformance with
 plans and specifications and are authorized to reject work or materials
 not in conformance with plans and specifications. An Inspector has
 neither the authority to issue instructions contrary to the plans and
 specifications nor to alter or waive the provisions of the contract.
 The Resident Engineer may appoint a Project Supervisor who will serve
 as Lead Inspector.
 Unresolved contractor and Inspector disputes relative to interpretation
 of plans and specifications or acceptability of work or materials will be
 escalated to the Resident Engineer.
 105.12
 
 Inspection of Work:
 
 All materials and each part or detail of the work shall be subject to
 inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer shall be allowed access to
 all parts of the work and shall be furnished with such information and

 Department unless the Engineer failed to inspect after having been
 given a minimum of 48 hours notice in writing that the work was to be
 performed. Failure to reject any defective work or materials shall not in
 any way prevent later rejection when such defect is discovered nor
 obligate the Engineer to final acceptance.
 W hen any unit of government, political subdivision, utility or any
 railroad corporation is to pay a portion of the cost of the work covered
 by the contract, its respective representatives shall have the right to
 inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense make any unit of
 government, political subdivision or any railroad corporation a party to
 the contract and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either party
 to the contract.
 105.13
 
 Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work:
 
 All work which does not conform to the requirements of the contract will
 be considered as unacceptable work unless otherwise determined to be
 acceptable in accordance with the requirements of Subsection 105.04.

 Load Restrictions:
 
 The contractor shall comply with all legal load restrictions in the
 hauling of materials on public roads beyond the limits of the project. A
 pamphlet, Sizes and W eights of Vehicles and Loads upon Highways, is
 available from the Motor Vehicle Division, Arizona Department of
 Transportation.
 A special permit will not relieve the contractor of
 liability for damage which may result from hauling of material or moving
 of equipment.
 The operation of equipment of such weight or so loaded as to cause
 damage to structures or the roadway or to any other type of
 construction will not be permitted.
 Hauling of materials over the

 If at any time during the prosecution of the project the contractor
 completes a unit or portion of the project, the contractor may submit a
 written request to the Engineer to make inspection of that unit. The
 Engineer will approve or disapprove the request within five working
 days.
 If approved, and the Engineer finds upon inspection that the unit has
 been satisfactorily completed in compliance with the contract, the
 Engineer may accept that unit as being completed and the contractor
 may be relieved of further responsibility for that unit. Such partial
 acceptance shall in no way void or alter any of the terms of the
 contract.
 (B)
 
 F i n a l Ac c e p t a n c e :
 
 Upon notice from the contractor that the entire project is substantially
 complete, the Engineer will make an inspection. If all construction
 provided for and contemplated by the contract is found completed to the
 Engineer's satisfaction, that inspection will constitute the final
 inspection and the Engineer will make the final acceptance and notify
 the contractor in writing of this acceptance as of the date of the final
 inspection.
 If, however, the inspection discloses any work, in whole or in part, as
 being unsatisfactory or not complete, the Engineer will give the
 contractor written notice of the unsatisfactory or incomplete work and
 the contractor shall immediately correct such work. In such case, the
 Engineer will also give the contractor written notice as to whether or
 not the work is substantially complete. In addition, final acceptance
 70
 
 SECTION 105
 will not be made until all completed plans and working drawings as
 required in Subsection 105.03 have been submitted and deemed
 acceptable by the Engineer.
 Upon completion and correction of the work, as called for by the
 Engineer's notice, the above procedures will be repeated until the
 Engineer gives notice of substantial completion and final acceptance,
 separately or together.

 jurisdiction of the USDA Forest Services (Forest Service), the
 contractor shall comply with all applicable State and Federal laws,
 94
 
 SECTION 107
 Federal rules and regulations, and the requirements of the National
 Forest in which the work is located.
 Throughout this subsection, the term Forest Service Officer is used.
 This person shall be understood to be the District Ranger or any other
 person authorized or duly appointed to act in all matters affecting
 National Forest lands and resources. Forest Service Officers for each
 project, when applicable, will be designated in the Special Provisions.
 Additional requirements of the National Forest may be specified in the
 Special Provisions and may include a clearing plan, a mining plan, and
 an erosion control and seeding plan.
 Unless provided for otherwise in the Special Provisions, the contractor
 shall comply with the following minimum requirements for activities
 within the National Forest:
 (1) The contractor shall do everything reasonably within the
 contractor's power to prevent forest fires and shall not
 dispose of material by burning without a written permit
 from the Forest Service.
 (2) The contractor shall not cut timber or brush or
 commence work in any material pit unless a permit to do
 so has been obtained from the Forest Service.
 (3) The contractor shall fully repair all damage caused by
 its operations and provide maintenance commensurate
 with the contractor's use of National Forest roads and
 trails.
 (4) The contractor shall fully comply with all requirements
 regarding air quality.
 The Department’s publication, Requirements for the Utilization of the
 Schedule of Equipment Rental Rates for Equipment Used on Force
 Account W ork, will not be applicable when the contractor's equipment is
 being utilized under the direction of the Forest Service Officer in the
 suppression of fires.
 (B)
 
 Fire Plan:
 
 The following outlines the mutual responsibilities of the Forest Service,
 the Department and the contractor to ensure effective prevention and
 prompt suppression of all fires within the right-of-way and other work
 areas.

 Fires discovered by the contractor and its employees shall be promptly
 reported to the Engineer and the Forest Service Officer. The contractor
 and its employees shall take action on any and all fires within the
 right-of-way and work areas and within a half-mile zone adjacent
 95
 
 SECTION 107
 thereto. Fires shall be attacked promptly so as to control them while
 they are small. Fires shall not be abandoned until the Forest Service
 Officer declares the fire to be out or relieves the contractor and its
 employees.
 The contractor shall place its equipment and employees at the disposal
 of the Forest Service Officer for the purpose of fighting fires in
 accordance with this plan.
 Equipment will be operated by employees of the contractor. The Forest
 Service will assume no responsibility toward such equipment for
 ordinary wear or damage due to negligence, carelessness, or willful
 misconduct.
 (2) Personnel:
 
 The contractor shall provide the Forest Service Officer with a list of the
 names of key personnel who will act in the matter of fire prevention and
 fire suppression. The Forest Service Officer will provide the contractor
 a similar list of names. Each list shall be kept current as to the names,
 addresses and phone numbers.
 (3) Reimbursement:
 
 Reimbursement to the contractor or the contractor's employees for
 equipment utilized, including operators, will be made by the Forest
 Service in accordance with rates which have been previously negotiated
 and agreed upon. These rates will be established prior to mobilization
 of personnel and equipment to be used for the suppression of fires.
 The Forest Service will not reimburse the contractor, subcontractor, or
 their employees for the suppression of fires started by them.
 The contractor and the contractor's employees, in suppressing fires
 caused by others, including lightning-caused fires, in work areas or
 within a half-mile zone of work areas will be reimbursed by the Forest
 Service for such suppression.
 In emergencies, the contractor and the contractor's employees may be
 called upon to suppress fires on other National Forest lands outside the
 normal half-mile zone.
 The contractor and its employees will be
 reimbursed by the Forest Service for such suppression.
 If the Forest Service requests that any equipment be made available on
 standby status, reimbursement to the contractor will be made at a rate
 established by negotiation.

 may be incorrect.
 The contractor shall furnish the Engineer with
 evidence that the contractor has contacted the utility companies and
 shall furnish the Engineer with a copy of the information furnished it as
 a result of such contacts.
 If the contractor learns from either the owner of the utility or from any

 cable television companies either omitted from or shown incorrectly on
 the project plans, the contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer
 and shall not disturb the utilities. Relocation or adjustment of such
 utilities, if deemed necessary, will be either performed by others or
 shall be performed by the contractor in accordance with the provisions
 of Subsection 104.02.

 the location of those on or near the surface of the ground which are not
 readily visible shall be determined. Such locations shall be marked in
 such a manner so that all workmen or equipment operators will be
 t h o r o u g h l y a p p r i s e d o f t h e i r e xi s t e n c e a n d l o c a t i o n .
 It will be the
 contractor's responsibility to see that every effort possible has been
 made to acquaint those actually involved in working near utilities not
 only with the type, size, location and depth, but with the consequences
 that might follow any disturbance. No trenching or similar operation
 shall be commenced until the Engineer is satisfied that every possible
 effort has been taken by the contractor to protect utilities.
 W hen the operations of the contractor result in any damage to any
 utility line or service connection, the location of which has been
 brought to the contractor's attention, the contractor shall assume full
 responsibility for such damage.
 In the event of interruption to water or utility services as a result of
 a c c i d e n t a l b r e a k a g e o r a s a r e s u l t o f l i n e s b e i n g e xp o s e d o r
 unsupported, the contractor shall promptly notify the proper authority
 and shall cooperate with the said authority in the restoration of service.
 W hen service is interrupted, repair work shall be continuous until the
 service is restored. No work shall be undertaken around fire hydrants
 until provisions for continued service have been approved by the local
 fire authority.
 Temporary or permanent relocation or adjustment of any utility line or
 service connection desired by the contractor for its convenience shall
 be its responsibility. The contractor shall obtain the approval of both
 the Engineer and the utility company and upon approval shall make all
 necessary arrangements with the utility company and shall bear all
 costs in connection with such relocation or adjustment.

 No Waiver of Legal Rights:
 
 Partial or final acceptance pursuant to Subsection 105.20 shall not
 preclude or prohibit the Department from correcting any measurement,
 estimate, or certificate made before or after completion of the work, nor
 shall the Department be precluded or prohibited from recovering from
 the contractor, or its surety, insurance or any combination thereof, such
 overpayment as it may sustain, or by failure on the part of the
 contractor to fulfill his obligations under the contract. A waiver on the
 part of the Department of any breach of any part of the contract shall
 not be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 The contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the contract, shall be
 liable to the Department for latent defects, fraud, or such gross
 mistakes as may amount to fraud, or as regards to the Department's
 rights under any warranty or guaranty.
 107.18

 of their employees who perform services on the contract during the
 duration of the contract. The State shall retain the right to perform
 random audits of contractor and subcontractor records or to inspect
 papers of any employee thereof to ensure compliance.
 105
 
 SECTION 107
 (B)
 
 Compliance Requirements:
 
 By submission of a bid, the contractor warrants that the contractor and
 all proposed subcontractors are and shall remain in compliance with all
 federal, state and local immigration laws and regulations relating to the
 immigration status of their employees who perform services on the
 contract. The State may, at its sole discretion, require evidence of
 compliance from the contractor or subcontractor.
 Should the State
 request evidence of compliance, the contractor or subcontractor shall
 have ten working days from receipt of the request to supply adequate
 information.
 The Department will accept, as evidence of compliance, a showing by
 the contractor or subcontractor that it has followed the employment
 verification provisions of the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act as
 set forth in Sections 274A and 274B of that Act, including
 implementation of regulations and agreements between the Department
 of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration’s
 verification service.
 The contractor shall include the provisions of Subsection 107.19 in
 all its subcontracts.
 (C)
 
 Sanctions for Non Compliance:
 
 Failure to comply with the immigration laws or to submit proof of
 compliance constitutes a material breach of contract. The Department
 will reduce the contractor’s compensation by $10,000 for the initial
 instance of non-compliance by the contractor or a subcontractor.
 Should the same contractor or subcontractor commit subsequent
 violations within a two-year time period from the initial violation, the
 contractor’s compensation will be reduced by $50,000 for each
 violation. The third instance by the same contractor or subcontractor
 within a two-year period may result, in addition to the $50,000
 reduction in compensation, in removal of the offending contractor or
 subcontractor, suspension of work in whole or in part or, in the case of
 a third violation by the contractor, termination of the contract for
 default.
 In addition, the Department may debar a contractor or
 subcontractor who has committed three violations within a two-year
 period for up to one year. For purposes of this paragraph, a violation
 by a subcontractor does not count as a violation by the contractor.
 Any delay resulting from a sanction under this subsection is a none xc u s a b l e d e l a y . T h e c o n t r a c t o r i s n o t e n t i t l e d t o a n y c o m p e n s a t i o n o r

 Subletting of Contract:
 
 The contractor shall not sublet, sell, transfer, assign or otherwise
 dispose of the contract or contracts or any portion thereof or of the
 contractor's right, title or interest therein without written consent of the
 Engineer.
 In case such consent is given, the contractor will be
 permitted to sublet a portion thereof, but shall perform with the
 contractor's own organization work amounting to not less than 40
 percent of the original contract amount. No subcontracts or transfer of
 contract shall release the contractor of its liability under the contract
 and bond.
 "Contractor's own organization" shall be construed to include only
 workers employed and paid directly by the prime contractor and
 equipment owned or rented by it, with or without operators. Such term
 does not include employees or equipment of a subcontractor, assignee,
 or agent of the prime contractor.
 The contract amount upon which the 40-percent requirement is
 computed includes the cost of materials and manufactured products
 which are to be purchased or produced by the contractor under the
 contract provisions.
 A person who has been convicted of a violation of Arizona Revised
 Statutes Section 34-252 is not eligible to enter into any contract either
 as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, for a period of up to three
 years, from date of conviction, as determined by the court. A person
 means any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other
 entity formed for the purpose of doing business as contractor,
 subcontractor or supplier.
 The Department may also refuse to approve any entity as a
 subcontractor or supplier for any of the reasons for which it could
 refuse to issue the entity a proposal pamphlet, suspend the entity from
 bidding, or declare the entity non-responsible.
 The Department’s consent to a subcontract will be given only after the
 Department determines that the subcontract, purchase order, or lease
 agreement is evidenced in writing and that it contains all pertinent
 107
 
 SECTION 108
 provisions and requirements of the prime contract. The following data
 shall be submitted seven calendar days prior to the start of each

 The Engineer will not consent to subletting of any portion of the
 contract if a copy of the subcontract or lower tier subcontract is not
 received. The Engineer's consent shall in no way be construed to be
 an endorsement of the subcontractor or its ability to complete the work
 in a satisfactory manner.
 Calculation of the 60 percent subcontracting limit will be based upon
 the amount of work subcontracted and verified by subcontract
 documents.
 Subcontractors performing contracting work subject to Arizona Revised
 Statutes Sections 32-1101 et seq. shall be duly licensed in accordance
 with those statutes. Subcontractors providing other services shall be
 licensed in accordance with the requirements of Arizona Law.

 Preconstruction Conference:
 
 The contractor shall meet with the Engineer for a preconstruction
 conference prior to commencing work.
 The conference may be
 combined with the partnering conference, and all requirements of this
 subsection may be submitted at that time. Should both conferences be
 held at the same time, the partnering conference will be held first.
 At the preconstruction conference the contractor shall submit a
 progress schedule showing the order in which the contractor proposes
 to carry out the work, the dates on which the contractor and its
 subcontractors will start the salient features of the work, including
 procurement of materials, equipment, etc.; the ordering of articles of
 special manufacture; the furnishing of drawings, plans and other data
 required under Subsection 105.03 for the review and approval of the
 Engineer; the inspection of structural steel fabrication; and the
 contemplated dates for the completion of the said salient features. The
 schedule may be in a bar chart format or a critical path method format.
 No schedule activity shall be shorter than one day or longer than 15
 working days. The schedule must show interrelationships among the
 activities, and the controlling items of work throughout the project shall
 be identified. If requested by the Engineer, the contractor shall furnish
 information needed to justify activity time durations. Such information
 shall include estimated manpower, equipment, unit quantities, and
 production rates. The schedule shall illustrate the completion of the
 work not later than the contract completion date.
 The contractor shall furnish authorized signature forms and a list of the
 contractor's proposed subcontractors and major material suppliers.
 Progress schedules shall have considered the time requirement for
 ordering articles of special manufacture to meet specific requirements
 of the work and Subsection 604-3.04 when structural steel fabrication
 inspection is required.
 If the contract requires trainees on the project, the contractor shall
 submit a schedule showing the number of trainees, the hours and the
 work items for which trainees will be used.
 109
 
 SECTION 108
 If the contract has a DBE requirement, the contractor shall submit
 copies of completed and signed DBE subcontracts, purchase orders, or
 invoices to the Department.
 The contractor shall submit a traffic control plan in accordance with
 Subsection 701-1. The contractor shall designate an employee who is
 c o m p e t e n t a n d e xp e r i e n c e d i n t r a f f i c c o n t r o l t o i m p l e m e n t a n d m o n i t o r
 the traffic control plan. The qualifications of the designated employee
 must be satisfactory to the Engineer.
 The contractor shall submit a safety plan and designate an employee as
 Safety Supervisor, in accordance with Subsection 107.08.
 Both plans must be satisfactory to the Engineer.
 During the preconstruction conference, the Engineer will designate a
 Department employee or employees who will be responsible to see that
 the traffic control plans and any alterations thereto are implemented
 and monitored to the end that traffic is carried through the work in an
 effective manner.
 If approved by the Engineer, the contractor may
 designate one employee to be responsible for both the traffic control
 and safety plans. The contractor shall not designate its superintendent
 as the responsible person for either the traffic control plan or the safety
 plan, unless approved by the Engineer.
 If the project requires that contractor or State personnel to work from
 falsework, within shoring, or in any other hazardous area the contractor
 shall submit as part of the contractor's safety plan specific measures it
 will use to ensure worker safety.
 The contractor shall also submit a program for erosion control and
 pollution prevention, as set forth in Subsection 104.09, on all projects
 involving clearing and grubbing, earthwork, structural work, or other
 construction, when such work is likely to create erosion or pollution
 problems.
 If the contractor fails to provide the required submissions, the Engineer
 may order the preconstruction conference suspended until such time as
 they are furnished.
 W ork shall not begin until the preconstruction
 conference has been concluded and the safety plan has been approved,
 unless authorized by the Engineer. The contractor shall not be entitled
 t o a d d i t i o n a l c o m p e n s a t i o n o r a n e xt e n s i o n o f c o n t r a c t t i m e r e s u l t i n g

 Prosecution and Progress:
 
 110
 
 SECTION 108
 The contractor shall start the work in accordance with the requirements
 of Subsection 108.02. The contractor shall notify the Engineer at least
 24 hours before beginning work.
 Unless suspended, the work shall be diligently and continuously carried
 on to completion and the contractor agrees to provide at all times an
 adequate force of labor and sufficient materials and equipment to
 insure the completion of the contract within the time allowed. The
 progress of the work shall be at a rate sufficient to complete the
 contract in an acceptable manner within the time allowed.
 At a mutually convenient location and time, the contractor shall meet
 weekly with the Engineer to discuss construction activities; however, a
 meeting may be waived if mutually agreed to, due to weather
 conditions, work progress, or for other reasons. At the meetings, the
 contractor shall provide the Engineer with a detailed, written schedule
 of all construction activities and phases of work for the forthcoming two
 week period.
 This written schedule shall detail the start and
 anticipated completion dates of major phases of work as well as
 indicate the status of major ongoing activities. Minutes of the weekly
 meetings will be kept by the Engineer and a copy given to the
 contractor. Failure to provide an accurate, appropriate schedule may
 be grounds for the suspension of the work.
 Schedule changes requiring an increase in the Department's
 engineering personnel will not be put into effect for 10 days after the
 submission of weekly schedules detailing such activities, or until the
 Engineer has made arrangements for additional personnel, whichever is
 the shorter time.
 Every 60 days throughout the contract, or at any other time as
 requested by the Engineer, the contractor shall submit a revised
 progress schedule reflecting the actual progress of activities, all
 activity logic revisions, the anticipated completion dates of the major
 phases of work remaining, and the anticipated completion date of the
 work.
 108.05
 
 Limitation of Operations:
 
 The contractor shall conduct the work at all times in such a manner and
 in such sequence as will insure the least interference with traffic and
 the safety of the public and the protection of the workmen. It shall
 have due regard to the location of detours and to the provisions for
 handling traffic. It shall not open up work to the prejudice or detriment
 of work already started. The Engineer may require the contractor to
 finish a section of work which is in progress before work is started on
 any additional sections if the opening of such section is essential to
 public convenience.

 hours in advance if the contractor elects to work on any Saturday,
 Sunday or holiday.
 In general, all work shall be performed during daylight hours. If the
 contractor elects to perform work at night or if the contractor is
 required to do so in the Special Provisions, the contractor shall furnish,
 erect and maintain an amount of artificial lighting sufficient for the
 construction, flagging, inspection, etc. and for the safety of the workers
 and the traveling public. No night work shall be performed until the
 Engineer is satisfied that an adequate amount of artificial light has
 been furnished and placed properly.
 108.06
 
 Character of Workers:
 
 The contractor shall at all times employ sufficient labor and equipment
 for prosecuting the several classes of work to fulfill completion in the
 manner and within the time required by these specifications.

 operation of the equipment required to perform all work properly and
 satisfactorily.
 Any person employed by the contractor or by any subcontractor who, in
 the opinion of the Engineer, does not perform the contractor's work in a
 proper and skillful manner or is intemperate or disorderly shall, at the
 written request of the Engineer, be removed immediately by the
 contractor or subcontractor employing such person and shall not be
 employed again in any portion of the work without the approval of the
 Engineer.
 Should the contractor fail to remove such person or persons as
 required above or fail to furnish suitable and sufficient personnel for
 the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may suspend the work
 by written notice until compliance.
 108.07
 
 Methods and Equipment:
 
 All equipment which is proposed to be used on the work shall be of
 sufficient size and in such mechanical condition as to meet the
 requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of work.
 Equipment used on any portion of the project shall be such that no
 damage to the roadway, adjacent property or other highways will result
 from its use.
 W hen the construction methods and types of equipment to be used by
 the contractor in accomplishing the construction are not set forth in the
 contract, the contractor may use any methods or equipment that it
 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer will accomplish the
 contract work in conformity with the requirements of the contract.
 112
 
 SECTION 108
 W hen the contract specifies that the construction be performed by the
 use of certain methods and equipment, such methods and equipment
 shall be used unless others are authorized by the Engineer. If the
 contractor desires to use a method or type of equipment other than
 those specified in the contract, it may request authority from the
 Engineer to do so. The request shall be in writing and shall include a
 full description of the method and equipment proposed to be used and
 a n e xp l a n a t i o n o f t h e r e a s o n s f o r d e s i r i n g t o m a k e t h e c h a n g e . I f
 approval is given, it will be on the condition that the contractor shall be
 fully responsible for producing construction work in conformity with the
 contract requirements. If after trial use of the substituted methods or
 equipment, the Engineer determines that the work produced does not
 meet contract requirements, the contractor shall discontinue the use of
 the substitute method or equipment and shall complete the remaining
 construction with the specified methods and equipment. The contractor
 shall either remove the deficient work or replace it with work of
 specified quality or take such other corrective action as the Engineer
 may direct.
 108.08
 
 Determination and Extension of Contract Time:
 
 The Contract Time, as defined in Section 101, will be stated in the
 Special Provisions.
 W hen the contract time is on a working day basis, the Engineer will
 furnish the contractor a weekly statement showing the number of days
 charged to the contract for the preceding week and the number of days
 specified for completion of the contract. The contractor will be allowed
 one week after the contractor has received the statement in which to
 file a written protest with the Engineer setting forth in what respect
 such weekly statement is incorrect; otherwise the statement shall be
 deemed to have been accepted by the contractor as correct.
 W hen the contract time is on a calendar day basis, it shall consist of
 the number of calendar days stated in the contract counting from the
 starting date and including all Sundays, holidays and non-work days.
 All calendar days elapsing between the effective dates of any orders of
 the Engineer to suspend work and to resume work for suspensions not

 substantially complete.
 Contract time is based on the amount of work included in the original
 contract. If satisfactory fulfillment of the contract involves alterations
 to the contract that affect the contractor's completion time, the

 If the contractor requests additional time and if the Engineer finds that
 the work activities controlling overall job progress and the projected
 completion date were delayed because of conditions beyond the control
 and without the fault of the contractor, and could not have been

 it were the original time for completion.
 W hen substantial completion has been duly determined by the Engineer
 in accordance with the requirements of Subsection 105.19, the daily
 time charge will cease.

 Failure to Complete the Work on Time:
 
 For each calendar day or working day, as specified, that the contractor
 shall fail to achieve substantial completion after the contract time or
 calendar date specified for the completion of the work provided for in
 the contract, the sum shown in the schedule of liquidated damages
 specified below will be deducted from any monies due the contractor,
 not as a penalty, but as liquidated damages; provided, however, that
 due account will be taken of any adjustment of the contract time for the
 completion of the work allowed under the provisions of Subsection

 Termination of Contract for Default:
 
 If the contractor:
 Fails to begin the work under the contract within the time
 specified, or
 Fails to perform the work with sufficient workers and equipment
 or with sufficient materials to insure the prompt completion of
 said work, or
 Performs the work unsuitably or neglects or refuses to remove
 materials or to perform anew such work as may be rejected as
 unacceptable and unsuitable, or
 Discontinues the prosecution of the work, or
 Fails to resume work which has been discontinued within a
 reasonable time after notice to do so, or
 Becomes insolvent, or
 Allows any final judgment to stand against it unsatisfied for a
 period of 10 days, or
 Makes an "assignment for the benefit of creditors," or
 Fails to comply with contract requirements regarding minimum
 wage payments or equal employment opportunity requirements,
 or
 Is a party to fraud, or
 
 115
 
 SECTION 108
 For any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry on the work in an
 acceptable manner, the Engineer will give notice in writing to
 the contractor and to the contractor's surety of such delay,
 neglect or default.
 If the contractor or the contractor's surety within a period of 10 days
 after such notice shall not proceed in accordance therewith, the
 Department will, upon written notification from the Engineer of the fact
 of such delay, neglect or default and the contractor's failure to comply
 with such notice, have full power and authority without violating the
 contract to terminate the contract. The Department may appropriate or
 use any or all materials and equipment on the ground as may be
 suitable and acceptable and may enter into an agreement for the
 completion of said contract according to the terms and provisions
 thereof or use such other methods as in the opinion of the Engineer will
 be required for the completion of said contract in an acceptable
 manner.
 All costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the
 cost of completing the work under contract, will be deducted from any
 m o n i e s d u e o r w h i c h m a y b e c o m e d u e s a i d c o n t r a c t o r . I f s u c h e xp e n s e

 If it is determined, after termination of the contractor's right to proceed,
 that the contractor was not in default, the rights and obligations of the
 parties will be the same as if the termination had been issued for the
 convenience of the Department in accordance with Subsection 108.11.
 Thus, damages to which a contractor may be entitled as a result of an
 improper default termination will be limited to the amounts provided for
 in Subsection 108.11.

 Measurement of Quantities:
 
 All work completed under the contract will be measured by the Engineer
 according to United States standard measures.
 A station when used as a definition or term of measurement will be 100
 linear feet.
 The methods of measurement and computation to be used in
 determination of quantities of material furnished and of work performed
 under the contract will be those methods generally recognized as
 conforming to good engineering practice.
 119
 
 SECTION 109
 All items which are to be measured on an area basis will, unless
 otherwise specified, be measured by longitudinal and transverse
 measurements made along the surface area in such manner as to
 ascertain reasonably the true area of the item actually placed in
 accordance with contract requirements. No deductions will be made for
 i n d i v i d u a l f i xt u r e s h a v i n g a n a r e a o f n i n e s q u a r e f e e t o r l e s s .
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the
 project plans or as altered to fit field conditions.
 Unless otherwise specified, all items which are to be measured by the

 that item in such manner as to ascertain reasonably the true length of
 the item.
 In computing volumes of earthwork the average end area method or
 other acceptable methods will be used. Corrections will not be made
 for curvature, prismoidal corrections and similar refinements unless
 specified.
 The nominal diameter of wire, and the thickness of plates and sheets
 used in the manufacture of corrugated metal pipe, metal plate pipe
 culverts and arches, and metal cribbing will be specified and measured
 in decimal fractions of inches.
 The wire size in welded wire fabric used for concrete reinforcement will
 be identified by a W number directly corresponding to the
 cross-sectional area of the wire in hundredths of a square inch.
 The term "ton" will mean the short ton consisting of 2,000 pounds
 avoirdupois.
 All materials which are measured or proportioned by
 weight shall be weighed on accurate approved scales.
 W here the specifications require scales for the determination of weight,
 the use of load cells and electronic digital readout will be acceptable
 for all applications.
 The weighing system shall conform to and be
 maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Department of
 W eights and Measures.
 W hen using platform scales, materials shall be weighed by or under the
 inspection of Department personnel.
 W hen using hopper scales,
 Department personnel may weigh or inspect materials to be measured
 for payment. Inspection of weigh operations may be performed by the
 Engineer at any time.
 Scales of acceptable size shall be furnished by the contractor and shall
 be sealed by an inspector of the Department of W eights and Measures,
 State of Arizona, or a Licensed Service Agency approved by the State
 of Arizona Department of W eights and Measures. The Licensed Service
 Agency certifying the scales shall not be affiliated with the contractor
 or company supplying the materials for payment by weight.
 
 120
 
 SECTION 109
 During weighing operations, weights will be read and recorded to the
 nearest 100 pounds. The gross, tare, and net weights of each load will
 be recorded and documented with all or part of the following
 information as applicable to the type of scales and recording system
 used:
 Project Identification
 Contract Item Number
 Material Source/Plant Identification
 Date
 Load Number
 Truck Identification
 Time of W eighing
 Applicable W eights
 W eighperson's Signature
 Scales shall be resealed as often as required to assure accurate
 weights; scales shall be resealed at least once every 365 calendar
 days. The contractor shall also provide with each scale at least twenty
 50-pound certified weights to be used in checking the scale. Each
 weight shall be recertified one year from the date of previous
 certification by the Department of W eights and Measures Metrology
 Laboratory.
 Each weight shall be stamped with a number, and the
 contractor shall furnish a certificate showing the numbers of the
 weights and the dates of certification. Certification will be obtained
 from the Department of W eights and Measures Metrology Laboratory.
 Tests conducted by the Engineer to check the accuracy of scales shall
 not relieve the contractor of the responsibility of maintaining the
 accuracy of the scales.
 No measurement or direct payment will be made for all of the measures
 hereinbefore described taken to seal scales, provide and certify
 weights and to weigh materials.
 Each platform scale installation shall be provided with a shelter for the
 scale operator.
 The shelter shall be weatherproof and shall be
 provided with adequate ventilation, light, a stool and a work bench.
 The contractor shall provide means for heating or cooling the shelter to
 a reasonably comfortable degree if the work is in progress during cold
 o r h o t w e a t h e r . T h e a p p r o xi m a t e m i n i m u m d i m e n s i o n s f o r t h e s h e l t e r
 shall be six feet in width, eight feet in length and seven feet in height.
 W hen material will be measured by weight for payment using platform
 scales, trucks hauling such material shall be weighed empty at least
 once daily and at such other times as the Engineer directs. Each truck
 shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
 Materials to be measured by volume in the hauling vehicle shall be
 hauled in approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of
 delivery.
 Vehicles for this purpose may be of any size or type
 acceptable to the Engineer, provided that the body is of such shape
 121
 
 SECTION 109
 that the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined.
 vehicles shall be loaded to at least their water level capacity.
 
 All
 
 W hen requested by the contractor and approved by the Engineer in
 writing, material specified to be measured by the cubic yard may be
 weighed and such weight will be converted to cubic yards for payment
 purposes. Factors for conversion from weight measurement to volume
 measurement will be determined by the Engineer and shall be agreed to
 by the contractor before such method of measurement of pay quantities
 is used.
 Bituminous materials will be measured either by the gallon or by the
 ton.
 W hen bituminous materials are measured by the gallon, the volume as
 measured shall be corrected to the volume at 60 degrees F.
 Conversion from volume at 60 degrees F to tons is made in accordance
 with the requirements of Table 1005-6.
 Net certified scale weights or weights based on certified volumes in the
 case of rail shipments will be used as a basis of measurement, subject
 to correction when bituminous material has been lost from the car or
 the distributor, wasted or otherwise not incorporated into the work.
 W hen bituminous materials are shipped by truck or rail, net certified
 weights or volume subject to correction for loss or foaming, may be
 used for computing quantities.
 Cement will be measured by the ton or the hundredweight.
 Timber will be measured by the 1,000 feet board measure, M.F.B.M.,
 actually incorporated in the structure. Measurement will be based on
 n o m i n a l w i d t h s a n d t h i c k n e s s e s a n d t h e e xt r e m e l e n g t h o f e a c h p i e c e .
 The term "lump sum" when used as an item of payment will mean
 complete payment for the work described in the proposal.
 W hen a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, "lump sum"
 work) is specified as the unit of measurement, the unit will be
 construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 W hen standard manufactured items are specified such as fence, wire,
 plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduit, etc., and these items are identified
 by unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such identification will be
 considered to be nominal weights or dimensions.
 Unless more
 stringently

 completing the work according to the plans and specifications. Neither
 the payment of any estimate nor of any retained percentage shall
 relieve the contractor of any obligation to make good any defective
 work or material.
 No compensation will be made in any case for loss of anticipated
 profits.
 If the "Basis of Payment" clause in the specifications relating to any
 unit price in the bidding schedule requires that the said unit price cover
 and be considered compensation for certain work or material essential
 to the item, this same work or material will not also be measured or
 paid for under any other pay item which may appear elsewhere in the
 specifications.

 Unit Prices:
 
 Should paragraph (A) not apply, an attempt must be made, before
 proceeding to any other pricing method, to price the work described by
 the Supplemental Agreement in accordance with the unit prices
 provided for each bid item.
 (C)
 
 Detailed Estimate:
 
 If agreement cannot be reached by the Engineer and contractor to price
 the Supplemental Agreement in accordance with the unit prices
 provided for bid items, then the contractor must provide a detailed
 estimate of its proposed unit prices or lump sum amount to perform the
 work described in the Supplemental Agreement. This detailed estimate
 must include the following:
 (1) Estimate of labor effort by trade in man hours for each
 task.
 (2) Estimate of base labor and burdened labor rate.
 (3) Estimate of equipment cost including time requirements
 and rate.
 (4) Estimated cost of materials.

 124
 
 SECTION 109
 The contract price adjustment shall be based on the actual cost to the
 contractor as determined in (C)(1) through (C)(7) above, rather than on
 a force account basis, whenever possible.
 The contractor will be allowed 10 calendar days to prepare such a cost
 estimate.
 Direction to proceed with the work described in the
 Supplemental Agreement will not be provided to the contractor by the
 Engineer until a detailed estimate is provided. The contractor will not
 be entitled to an adjustment in the contract price or time for the time
 required to prepare and submit a detailed cost estimate.
 Upon receipt of the contractor's estimate, the Engineer will immediately
 schedule negotiations. Should such negotiations be conducted and a
 contract price adjustment not be agreed upon, the Engineer will
 consider the performance of the work on a force account basis,
 although the Engineer may at any time direct the contractor to proceed
 with the work on a force account basis.
 (D)
 
 F o r c e Ac c o u n t :
 
 If directed by the Engineer, work required by Supplemental Agreement
 may be performed on a force account basis.
 Such work will be
 compensated in the following manner:

 FR = fringe benefit rate as determined by payroll
 The contractor shall provide the hourly wage rates
 and fringe benefit rate at the preconstruction
 conference.
 The rates will be verified by
 comparison to the contractor’s payrolls.
 (b) Overtime pay (OT) which will be determined as
 follows:
 OT = [(W R x 1.5) + FR] x 1.5

 or overhead.
 (2) Materials:
 
 For all materials accepted by the Engineer and used in the work, the
 contractor will be paid the actual invoice cost of such materials

 (3) Equipment:
 
 Equipment which the Engineer considers necessary for the performance
 of work will be eligible for payment at the established rates only during
 t h e h o u r s t h a t i t i s o p e r a t e d e xc e p t a s o t h e r w i s e a l l o w e d e l s e w h e r e i n
 these specifications. Equipment hours will be recorded to the nearest
 one-half hour. For the use of equipment owned by the contractor and
 approved by the Engineer, the contractor will be paid the rental rates,
 as modified herein, set forth in the Rental Rate Blue Book (RRBB) for
 Construction Equipment which is published by the Equipment
 Guide-Book Company, a division of Nielson - Dataquest, 1290 Ridder
 Park Drive, San Jose, California 95131, Phone (800) 669-3282. All rate
 determinations will be based on the Blue Book rental rate chapter
 revisions that are applicable at the time the equipment is being used.
 (a) Rental Rates (Without Operators):
 
 The hourly equipment rental rate (HERR) will be determined by the
 following formula:
 ⎡ 1 .1 5 x R⎤
 HERR = F x ⎢
 ⎥ + HOC
 ⎣ 176 ⎦
 
 W here:
 F
 
 = Adjustment factor to R as shown in the
 Special Provisions.
 
 R
 
 = Current RRBB Monthly Rate
 
 126
 
 SECTION 109
 HOC = Hourly operating cost
 An overhead and profit adjustment of 15 percent of the rates provided
 in the Rental Rate Blue Book is included in the above formula.
 The hourly operating cost represents the major costs of equipment
 operation, such as fuel and oil, lubrication, field repairs, tires,
 e xp e n d a b l e p a r t s a n d s u p p l i e s .
 For each piece of equipment used, whether bought or rented, the
 contractor shall provide the Engineer with the following information: the
 manufacturer's name, equipment type, year of manufacture, model
 number, type of fuel used, horsepower rating, attachments required,
 together with their size or capacity and any further information
 necessary to ascertain the proper rate.
 W hen multiple attachments are included with the rental equipment, only
 the attachment having the higher rental rate will be eligible for
 payment, provided the attachment has been approved by the Engineer
 as being necessary to the force account work.
 Rental charges will not be allowed for tools or equipment that show a
 daily rate less than five dollars or for unlisted equipment that has a
 value of less than four hundred dollars.
 The above provisions apply to approved equipment of modern design
 and in good working condition. The equipment shall be handled and
 used to provide normal output or production. Equipment that is not in
 good working condition or is not of proper size for efficient performance
 of the work may be rejected by the Engineer. Equipment ordered for
 force account work will be paid for until such time as the Engineer
 directs that the use of such equipment be discontinued or until
 completion of the work.
 Unless
 otherwise
 specified,
 manufacturer's
 ratings
 and
 manufacturer-approved modifications shall be used to classify
 equipment for the determination of applicable rental rates. Equipment
 which has no direct power unit shall be powered by a unit of at least
 the minimum rating recommended by the manufacturer.
 If it is deemed necessary by the Engineer to use equipment not listed in
 the above publication, a suitable rate for such equipment will be
 established by the Engineer. The contractor may furnish cost data
 which might assist the Engineer in the establishment of such rental
 rate. The rental rates shall be agreed to in writing prior to the use of
 such equipment on force account work or paid for by invoices in the
 case of outside rented equipment.
 (b) Stand-By Time:
 
 Equipment that is in operational condition and is standing by with the
 Engineer’s approval for participation in Force Account W ork shall be
 paid for according to the following Stand-By Rate (SBR):
 127
 
 SECTION 109
 ⎛ R ⎞
 SBR = F × ⎜
 ⎟ × 1/ 2
 ⎝ 176 ⎠
 
 Payment for “stand-by” will be limited to not more than eight hours in a
 24-hour day or 40 hours in a normal week. No compensation shall be
 allowed for equipment that is inoperable due to breakdown.
 No
 payment shall be allowed for equipment that is not operating because
 work has been suspended by the contractor for the contractor’s
 reasons.
 (c) Outside Rented Equipment:
 
 In cases where a piece of equipment to be used is rented or leased by

 contractor will be paid as follows:
 [Rental Invoice x 1.10] + HOC
 The above formula includes a 10 percent markup of the rental invoice
 for all overhead and incidental costs for furnishing the equipment.
 (d) Moving of Equipment:
 
 Rental time will also be allowed for the time required to move needed
 equipment to the location of the force account work and to return it to
 its original location. Loading and transportation costs will be allowed
 in lieu of moving times when equipment is moved by means other than
 its own power. Moving time back to the original location or loading and
 transportation costs will not be allowed if the equipment is used at the
 site of the force account work on contract items or related work.
 F o r u s e o f e q u i p m e n t m o v e d o n t h e w o r k e xc l u s i v e l y f o r f o r c e a c c o u n t
 work, the cost of transferring the equipment to the site of the work and
 returning it to the original location will be allowed as specified herein
 a s a n a d d i t i o n a l i t e m o f e xp e n s e .
 The original location of the equipment to be hauled to the site of the
 work shall be agreed to by the Engineer in advance.
 W here the move of the equipment is made by common carrier, the
 allowance will be the invoiced amount paid for the freight plus fifteen
 percent. If the contractor hauls the equipment with its own forces,
 rental will be allowed for the hauling unit plus the driver's wages and
 the cost of loading and unloading the equipment.
 T h e m a xi m u m r e n t a l p e r i o d f o r t h e d a y t h a t t h e e q u i p m e n t i s m o v e d o n

 prevent continuous contact between the concrete surface and the drain
 material. The geocomposite drain shall be installed with the single
 fabric surface in contact with the backfill material. W hen the core of
 the geocomposite wall drain is not perforated during manufacture,
 perforations shall be made in the core where the wall drain will lay
 against a weephole or other drainage outlet.
 W hen making these
 perforations, the fabric shall not be damaged in any way.
 168
 
 SECTION 203
 Unless otherwise specified, geocomposite wall drains shall be
 constructed in horizontal courses and in accordance with the details
 shown on the plans. To prevent infiltration of the backfill material, the
 geocomposite material shall be firmly secured to the face, top and
 sides of the wall by using adhesive or 1.5 to 2 inch long concrete nails
 with approved washers or wood battens of not less than four square
 inches in area. The adhesive or alignment of the core shall not affect
 the drainage area or downward flow within the core. The spacing of
 concrete nails shall be as directed by the Engineer, but shall not be
 more than four feet apart, both horizontally and vertically. W hen nails
 are utilized, there shall be at least one horizontal row of nails in each
 course of geocomposite.
 Horizontal seams shall be formed by utilizing the four-inch flap of
 g e o t e xt i l e f a b r i c e xt e n d i n g f r o m t h e u p p e r g e o c o m p o s i t e c o u r s e a n d

 flap shall be securely fastened to the lower fabric by means of a
 continuous strip of three-inch wide, waterproof plastic tape.
 W here vertical splices are necessary at the end of a geocomposite roll
 o r p a n e l , a n e i g h t - i n c h w i d e c o n t i n u o u s s t r i p o f g e o t e xt i l e f a b r i c m a y b e
 placed, centering over the seam and continuously fastened on both
 sides with the three-inch wide, waterproof plastic tape.
 As an alternative method of splicing, either horizontally or vertically,
 rolls of geocomposite drain material may be joined together by turning
 back the fabric at the roll edges and interlocking the cuspations
 a p p r o xi m a t e l y t w o i n c h e s . F o r o v e r l a p p i n g i n t h i s m a n n e r , t h e f a b r i c i s
 then lapped over and tightly taped beyond the seam with the three-inch
 wide, waterproof tape. Interlocking of the core shall always be in the
 direction of water flow.
 T o p r e v e n t s o i l i n t r u s i o n , a l l e xp o s e d e d g e s o f t h e g e o c o m p o s i t e
 drainage core shall be covered by tucking the four-inch fabric lap over
 and behind the core edge. Alternatively, a 12-inch wide strip of fabric
 m a y b e u t i l i z e d i n t h e s a m e m a n n e r , t a p i n g i t t o t h e e xp o s e d f a b r i c
 eight inches in from the edge with a continuous strip of three-inch wide,
 waterproof, plastic tape and folding the remaining four inches over and
 behind the core edge.
 Should the fabric become damaged during installation by tearing or
 puncturing, the damaged section shall be cut out and replaced
 completely. If, in the judgment of the Engineer, the damage is not
 serious enough to warrant removal, the damaged area may be repaired
 by overlaying with a piece of fabric, large enough to cover the damaged
 area and provide a four-inch overlap on all sides, and taping it in place
 with three-inch wide strips of waterproof, plastic tape.
 Structural backfill operations shall be started as soon as possible after
 placing the geocomposite material, but in no case shall the
 g e o c o m p o s i t e m a t e r i a l b e e xp o s e d t o s u n l i g h t f o r m o r e t h a n 1 4 d a y s

 provisions of the Specifications which may affect thickness shall not be
 construed to modify the lean concrete base thickness requirements.
 To determine thickness acceptability, the contractor shall drill four-inch
 minimum diameter cores at the locations specified by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will determine average core thickness in accordance with
 t h e p r o v i s i o n s o f A A S H T O T 1 4 8 , e xc e p t t h a t t h e m e a s u r e m e n t s w i l l b e
 made to the nearest thousandth of an inch, and the average of the

 initial core is less than the specified thickness or when there is any
 question as to the unit thickness, thicknesses will be determined in
 accordance with AASHTO T 148.
 To determine the acceptability of each lot of lean concrete base, the
 following procedures will be followed:
 An initial core shall be drilled in each lot and, if the thickness
 of the core is not deficient by more than 0.25 inches, the
 thickness of the lean concrete base in that lot will be
 considered acceptable.
 If the thickness of the initial core is deficient by more than 0.25
 inches, but less than or equal to 0.75 inches, two additional
 cores shall be drilled within that lot and the thickness of the
 three cores will be averaged. The average of the three cores
 will be used to determine acceptability, and the unit price paid
 for the Lean Concrete Base in that lot will be adjusted as
 specified in Subsection 305-5.
 If any core is deficient by more than 0.75 inches, additional

 direction from the deficient core, parallel to the roadway center
 line, until one core is obtained in each direction which is not
 deficient by more than 0.75 inches. The lean concrete base
 between these two cores will be evaluated separately from the
 balance of the lean concrete base in that lot, and unless
 otherwise directed by the Engineer, shall be removed and
 replaced with lean concrete base of the specified thickness.

 Surface Preparation:
 
 If the geogrid material is to be placed directly on the subgrade, the
 subgrade surface shall be compacted and finished according to
 Subsections 203-3.03, 203-10.03, or 205-3.04 prior to placement of the
 geogrid. If the geogrid material is to be placed within the aggregate
 base materials, the aggregate base surface upon which the geogrid will
 be placed, shall be compacted according to Subsection 303-3.02 and
 finished according to Subsection 303-3.03 before placement of the
 geogrid.
 306-3.04
 
 Geogrid Placement:
 
 The geogrid shall be rolled out along the alignment in the direction of
 advancing construction. All wrinkles and folds shall be removed.
 A 12-inch minimum overlap with securing pins is required at all joints
 (both transverse and longitudinal). Longitudinal joints shall be located
 210
 
 SECTION 306
 according to the requirements shown in Subsection 406-6 for pavement
 joints unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. At transverse joints,
 the preceding roll shall overlap the following roll in the direction that
 the aggregate base will be placed. Securing pins shall be 3/16-inch
 steel bars, pointed at one end and fabricated with a head to retain a
 steel washer having an outside diameter of not less than 1.5 inches.
 U-shaped pins shall be another option as approved by the Engineer.
 The length of the securing pins shall be four-inch minimum.
 The
 geogrid shall be tensioned by hand and anchored to the ground at the
 edges, including overlaps, and in the center of the roll at 30-foot
 intervals along the roll length, at the corners if applicable, or as
 directed by the Engineer. The use of securing pins may be reduced or
 eliminated by the Engineer if it can be shown that by careful installation
 the geogrid is adequately tensioned by hand and anchored by the
 placed aggregate in a progressive installation process as recommended
 by the manufacturer's representative.
 Care shall be taken to ensure that geogrid sections do not separate at
 overlaps during construction. Placement of geogrid around corners will
 require cutting of the geogrid product and diagonal overlapping of the
 s a m e t o m a k e s u r e t h a t e xc e s s i v e b u c k l i n g o f g e o g r i d m a t e r i a l d o e s n o t

 P l a c i n g a n d C o m p a c t i n g Ag g r e g a t e F i l l :
 
 The aggregate shall be back dumped and spread in a uniform lift
 maintaining the design aggregate thickness at all times. The aggregate
 material shall be bladed onto the geogrid in such a manner that the
 aggregate rolls onto the grid ahead, by gradually raising the dozer
 blade while moving ahead.
 If the underlying material is capable of supporting rubber tire trucks
 (end and belly dumps) they may drive over the grid at very low speeds,
 less than five miles per hour, and dump aggregate as they go. Sudden
 stops and turning by trucks shall be avoided while on the grid. No
 tracked vehicles should be allowed on the grid until there is a minimum
 of six inches of material between the tracks and the grid.
 Any ruts which might develop during spreading or compacting the
 aggregate shall be filled with additional aggregate rather than bladed
 from surrounding areas. Placing additional aggregate into the rutted
 areas insures that the design aggregate thickness is maintained.
 Geogrid damaged after or during construction will be repaired in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedure.
 Aggregate base shall be compacted as specified in Subsection

 construction joints. The concrete shall be struck off, consolidated and
 floated by mechanical methods. The contractor may, with the approval
 of the Engineer, use a free floating, oscillating screed device, which is
 a minimum of 10 feet in length and attached to the paver, in conjunction
 with or in lieu of tubular floats. W hen pavement widths are less than
 10 feet and where it is impractical to use mechanical methods, manual
 methods may be used to finish the concrete surface.
 If surface drying or cracking should occur prior to the application of
 curing material, the entire surface of the concrete shall be kept damp
 by applying water with a nozzle that atomizes the flow so that a mist
 and not a spray is formed. The water from the nozzle shall not be
 applied directly upon the concrete and shall not be allowed to
 accumulate on the concrete in a quantity sufficient to cause a flow or
 wash the surface.
 The contractor shall protect the base or subgrade when equipment is
 cleaned at the end of each days production. All concrete deposited on
 the base or subgrade during the cleaning operation shall be removed
 from the base or subgrade immediately after cleaning is completed.
 Any damage to the base or subgrade, shall be repaired, as approved by
 the Engineer, prior to commencing paving operations. W ater will not be
 permitted to pond on the roadway.

 pavement shall be removed before the end of each day's paving
 operations.
 It is important in the performance of the work and in the operation of
 equipment that no work shall lag and all operations shall be completed
 within the optimum or specified time; therefore, the Engineer may order
 the work suspended, if necessary, to maintain proper balance of
 operations so as to insure satisfactory results.
 (B)
 
 Slip-Form Method:
 
 The equipment shall spread, consolidate, screed and float-finish the
 concrete so that a minimum of hand finishing will be necessary and a
 well consolidated and homogeneous pavement is produced. Additional
 labor and equipment shall be supplied when paving beyond the limits of
 the side forms is required.
 The machine shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of
 the concrete. Such vibration shall be accomplished with vibrating tubes
 or arms working in the concrete and spaced not more than 24 inches
 center-to-center.
 Vibrators shall operate at a minimum of 8,000
 impulses per minute. Concrete placement shall cease immediately if a
 vibrator fails to function and cannot be immediately repaired, replaced,
 or supplemented with additional vibrators.

 SECTION 401
 Three types of self-propelled mechanical equipment: the spreader, the
 finisher, and the float will be required; however, a single machine
 combining two or more of these operations may be used if it has been
 demonstrated that such a machine will accomplish satisfactory results.
 All wheels of all machines that ride on finished concrete surfaces shall
 be equipped with rubber tires.
 The concrete shall be spread uniformly between the forms, immediately
 after it is placed, by means of the spreading machine. The spreader
 shall be followed by the finishing machine equipped with not less than
 two oscillating or reciprocating screeds. The spreading machine or the
 finishing machine shall be equipped with vibrating equipment that will
 vibrate the concrete for the full paving width. Vibrators shall be used
 adjacent to the longitudinal edge of the pavement. These vibrators
 shall be attached to the rear of the spreading machine or to the
 finishing machine. Vibrators shall not rest on new pavements or side
 forms or contact any tie bars, and power to the vibrators shall be such
 that when the motion of the machine is stopped, vibration will cease.
 Vibrators shall operate at a minimum of 8000 impulses per minute.
 The concrete shall be spread full width before being struck off by the
 finishing machine. The concrete shall be struck off and consolidated so
 that the surface will conform to the finished grade and cross section
 shown on the project plans and at the same time leave sufficient
 material for the floating operation. The spreading or finishing machine
 shall move over the pavement as many times and at such intervals as
 may be required to insure thorough consolidation.
 After the pavement has been struck off and consolidated, it shall be
 floated with an approved longitudinal float.
 The contractor may use a longitudinal float composed of one or more
 cutting and smoothing floats, suspended from and guided by a rigid
 frame. The frame shall be carried by four or more wheels riding on,
 and constantly in contact with, the forms.
 The contractor may use a longitudinal float which is worked with a
 sawing motion while being held in a floating position parallel to the
 roadway centerline and while passing gradually from one side of the
 pavement to the other. Movements ahead along the centerline of the
 roadway shall be in successive advances of not more than one half the
 length of the float.
 In lieu of using either type of longitudinal float, a single machine which
 will affect satisfactory consolidating, finishing and floating may be
 used.
 This machine may be towed by a spreading machine.
 This
 combination finishing-floating machine shall be equipped with screeds
 and vibrators as hereinbefore specified for finishing machines.
 Floating shall be accomplished with a non-oscillating float held in a
 suspended position from the frame.
 
 221

 The concrete shall be consolidated by internal vibration.
 Vibrators
 shall operate at a minimum of 8000 impulses per minute.
 Use of
 vibrators for shifting of the concrete mass will not be permitted.
 After consolidation, the concrete shall be tamped to the proper surface
 elevation and cross section with an approved tamping or screeding
 device or with a mechanical vibrating unit spanning the full width
 between forms. A small surplus of concrete shall be kept in front of the
 tamper or vibrating unit. Tamping or vibrating shall continue until the
 required cross section is obtained and the mortar is flushed slightly to
 the surface.
 Other approved methods may be used to finish the concrete.

 the contract unit price for the pavement repaired, as measured between
 the original longitudinal and transverse pavement joints abutting the
 repaired pavement; however, no adjustment to the contract unit price
 will be made for pavement slabs which contain only cracks which are
 observed later than 28 days after concrete placement.
 Unit price
 adjustments for cracked pavement slabs which require repair will be
 made independently of all unit price adjustments made for compressive
 strength, pavement thickness, and pavement smoothness.
 Payment for thickness and compressive strength will be by the lot. Lot
 limits are described in Subsection 401-4.04 and Subsection 1006-7.03.
 For each lot, pay factors will be determined for increasing or
 decreasing the unit price of the lot or rejection of the lot. The “Percent

 Unit price adjustments for pavement smoothness will be made
 independently of all unit price adjustments made for pavement
 thickness, compressive strength, and cracked pavement slabs which
 require repair.
 Pavement rejected in accordance with this Section or Section 1006
 shall be removed and replaced with pavement meeting the requirements
 of both sections. However, within ten days of notification of rejected
 pavement, the contractor may submit a written proposal to accept the
 pavement at a reduced unit price. W hen the contractor has elected to
 rely on the results of core testing for compressive strength, the ten
 days will commence upon notification of the results of core testing.
 Such proposal shall contain an engineering analysis of the anticipated
 performance of the pavement if allowed to remain in place.
 The
 reduction in unit price shall reflect the commensurate reduction in life

 W ithin five working days after receiving the
 contractor’s proposal, the Engineer will determine whether or not to
 accept it and will so notify the contractor.
 If the proposal is not
 accepted, the pavement shall be removed and replaced as hereinbefore
 specified. If the proposal is accepted, the Engineer will specify the
 conditions of acceptance.

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Bituminous materials will be measured by the ton.
 Bituminous material that is required to be diluted prior to application
 will be measured by the ton of diluted material.
 Cover material, when specified, will be measured by the cubic yard.
 Cover material will be weighed, and the amount in tons of dry material
 will be converted to cubic yards. The weight of all moisture contained
 in the cover material will be deducted prior to the conversion of the
 weight in tons to the volume in cubic yards. The dry weight per cubic
 yard will be determined in accordance with the requirements of
 AASHTO T 19.
 The contractor shall be responsible to determine the amount of cover
 material that will be required to complete the work from the source or
 sources from which the cover material is obtained.
 Blotter material, when required, will be measured by the ton.
 Measurement for payment will be made only for the quantity of
 bituminous material and for the quantity of aggregate material used in
 accordance with the requirements of these specifications.
 Time to apply tack coat is defined as the hours within a work shift that
 an approved distributor truck containing the specified bituminous
 material is required by the Engineer to be at the work site.
 The time which is required to apply tack coat will be measured to the

 than one shift, the following conditions apply: at least one sample shall
 be taken each shift, at least one sample shall be taken every 500 tons,
 and no mix or target value changes shall be made within the lot. If
 changes are made in the mix design or target values, new lots will be
 established.
 Four samples of the asphaltic concrete shall be taken for each lot by
 the contractor, under the observation of the Engineer, at random
 locations designated by the Engineer.
 Samples shall be taken in
 accordance with the requirements of Section 2 or 3 of Arizona Test
 Method 104 and delivered to the Engineer immediately after being
 taken. The minimum weight of the sample shall be 75 pounds. The
 Engineer will split the sample and save one-half for 15 days after

 If a
 computerized mass-flow meter is used, documentation of its calibration
 shall be submitted to the Engineer prior to asphaltic concrete
 production.
 At any time during asphaltic concrete production, the
 Engineer may require that a new calibration of the mass-flow meter be
 performed. If there is a difference of greater than 0.1 percent asphalt
 cement content between the asphalt cement content measured by
 ignition furnace testing and the actual asphalt cement content, the
 contractor may request that a correction to the asphalt cement content
 by ignition furnace testing shall be made. The contractor must make
 such a request in writing within two working days after receiving the
 test results for the fifth lot of asphaltic concrete production. If referee
 testing is performed on a lot of asphaltic concrete for which a

 SECTION 406
 applied to test results from the beginning of asphaltic concrete
 production through the remainder of asphaltic concrete production
 using that mix design. If the contractor submits a new mix design, a
 new correction must be established and applied as specified above.
 For other plants, no correction will be made to asphalt cement content
 values measured by ignition furnace testing.
 Acceptance testing results will be furnished to the contractor within
 four working days of receipt of samples by the Engineer.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the test results obtained
 for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to the
 contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor may
 make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The referee
 testing shall be performed in an independent approved laboratory
 designated by the Engineer.
 The testing of the samples will be
 performed by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of
 the specific project conditions such as the identity of the contractor or
 mix design laboratory, the tests results by the Department, or the mix
 design targets for gradation and effective voids.
 The asphaltic
 concrete samples previously saved will be tested for Marshall density

 Effective voids will be determined in accordance with the requirements
 of Arizona Test Method 424.
 The samples shall also be tested in
 accordance with Arizona Test Method 427 for asphalt cement content
 by ignition furnace and gradation of the mineral aggregate. New PT's

 The results of these determinations will be binding on both the
 contractor and the Department.
 The Department will pay for this
 testing; however, if the total pay factor of the lot does not improve or is
 reduced, or the lot remains in reject, payment to the contractor for
 asphaltic concrete shall be reduced by the amount of the cost of this
 testing.

 Using the referee test results, the Engineer will determine a new PT for
 compaction. The result of this determination will be binding on both the
 contractor and the Department.
 The Department will pay for this
 testing; however, if the compaction pay factor of the lot does not
 improve, is reduced, or the lot remains in reject, payment to the
 contractor for asphaltic concrete shall be reduced by the amount of the
 cost of this testing.
 406-7.06
 
 Smoothness and Surface Tolerances:
 
 Asphaltic concrete shall be compacted as required, smooth and true to
 the required lines, grades, and dimensions.
 The Special Provisions may require the smoothness of the final
 pavement surface to be tested in accordance with Subsection 109.13.
 Regardless of whether testing in accordance with Subsection 109.13 is
 specified or not, the following requirements shall be met:
 (1) The surface of the final lift of asphaltic concrete placed under
 this section of the specifications shall be tested and shall not
 vary by more than 1/8 inch from the lower edge of a ten-foot
 straightedge when it is placed in the longitudinal direction
 (including across transverse joints), and when it is placed in the
 transverse direction across longitudinal joints.
 (2) The surface of any lift of asphaltic concrete placed under this
 section of the specifications, other than the final lift, shall be
 tested and shall not vary by more than 1/4 inch from the lower
 edge of a ten-foot straightedge when it is placed in the
 longitudinal direction (including across transverse joints), and
 when it is placed in the transverse direction across longitudinal
 joints.

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Asphaltic concrete will be measured by the ton for the asphaltic
 concrete actually used, which will include the weight of mineral
 a g g r e g a t e , a s p h a l t c e m e n t , a n d m i n e r a l a d m i xt u r e . M e a s u r e m e n t w i l l
 include any quantity used in construction of intersections, turnouts, or
 other miscellaneous items or surfaces.
 Asphalt cement will be measured by the ton on the basis of the asphalt
 cement content determined in accordance with Subsection 406-7.04 for
 each lot of asphaltic concrete accepted. The average asphalt cement
 content will be multiplied by the number of tons of asphaltic concrete in
 that lot to determine the amount of asphalt cement. If the contractor
 has requested referee testing, the average asphalt cement content will
 come from the independent testing laboratory results, unless a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value as allowed in Subsection 406-7.04. If a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value, the average asphalt cement content
 determined from the Department’s acceptance testing will be used. At
 the discretion of the Engineer, asphalt cement may be measured by
 invoice quantities, adjusted as necessary for waste. In no case shall
 the measured amount of asphalt cement for payment be greater than
 the total of the invoice quantities, adjusted for waste.

 Mix Design Revisions:
 
 297
 
 SECTION 407
 At any time after production of asphaltic concrete has been started
 using the approved mix design, changes may be proposed by the
 contractor or directed by the Engineer.
 The contractor shall not change its methods of crushing, screening,
 washing, or stockpiling from those used during production of material
 used for mix design purposes without approval of the Engineer, or
 without requesting a new mix design.
 If changes are made in the source or type of bituminous material or the
 source(s) of mineral aggregate, or changes are made in the proportions
 of mineral aggregate equal to or greater than five percentage points,
 a d d i t i o n a l t e s t i n g t o t h e e xt e n t d e e m e d n e c e s s a r y b y t h e E n g i n e e r w i l l
 be performed in order that the Engineer may be satisfied that the mix
 design criteria will be met.
 During production of asphaltic concrete the contractor, on the basis of
 field test results, may request a change to the approved mix design.
 The Engineer will evaluate the proposed changes and notify the
 contractor of the Engineer’s decision within two working days of the
 receipt of the request.
 If, at any time, unapproved changes are made by the contractor in the
 source or type of bituminous material, source(s) of mineral aggregate,
 production methods, or proportional changes in violation of approved
 mix design stipulations, production shall cease until a new mix design
 is developed at no additional cost to the Department, or the contractor
 complies with the approved mix design.
 At any time after the mix design has been approved, the contractor may
 request a new mix design. The costs associated with the testing of
 materials in the developing of mix designs requested by the contractor
 after a mix design acceptable to the Department has been developed
 shall be borne by the contractor.
 If the Engineer determines that a new mix design is necessary due to
 changes in mineral aggregate characteristics or gradation, costs
 associated with the development of the new mix design shall be borne
 by the contractor.
 A new mix design can be developed by the Engineer at any time the
 Engineer deems necessary. Should such a new mix design require
 revisions to the contractor's operations which result in additional cost
 to the contractor, it will be reimbursed for these costs. However, the
 Engineer reserves the right to modify the asphalt cement content
 without compensation being made to the contractor involving additional
 operation costs.

 The contract time established for the completion of the work includes
 10 working days for the required testing and the developing of the
 approved mix design.
 Asphaltic concrete production shall not begin until there is an approved
 mix design.
 413-5
 
 Mix Design Revisions:
 
 At any time after production of asphaltic concrete has been started
 using the approved mix design, changes may be proposed by the
 contractor or directed by the Engineer.
 The contractor shall not change its methods of crushing, screening,
 washing or stockpiling from those used during production of material
 used for mix design purposes without approval of the Engineer, or
 without requesting a new mix design.
 If changes are made in the source or type of bituminous material or the
 source(s) of mineral aggregate, or changes are made in the proportions
 of mineral aggregate equal to or greater than five percentage points,
 a d d i t i o n a l t e s t i n g t o t h e e xt e n t d e e m e d n e c e s s a r y b y t h e E n g i n e e r w i l l
 be performed in order that the Engineer may be satisfied that the mix
 design criteria will be met.
 During production of asphaltic concrete, the contractor, on the basis of
 field test results, may request a change to the approved mix design.
 The Engineer will evaluate the proposed changes and notify the
 contractor of the Engineer’s decision within two working days of the
 receipt of the request.
 
 333
 
 SECTION 413
 If, at any time, unapproved changes are made by the contractor in the
 source or type of bituminous material, source(s) of mineral aggregate,
 production methods, or proportional changes in violation of approved
 mix design stipulations, production shall cease until a new mix design
 is developed at no additional cost to the Department, or the contractor
 complies with the approved mix design.
 At any time after the mix design has been approved, the contractor may
 request a new mix design. The costs associated with the testing of
 materials in the developing of mix designs requested by the contractor
 after a mix design acceptable to the Department has been developed
 shall be borne by the contractor.
 If the Engineer determines that a new mix design is necessary due to
 changes in mineral aggregate characteristics or gradation, costs
 associated with the development of the new mix design shall be borne
 by the contractor.
 A new mix design can be developed by the Engineer at any time the
 Engineer deems necessary. Should such a new mix design require
 revisions to the contractor's operations which result in additional cost
 to the contractor, it will be reimbursed for these costs. However, the
 Engineer reserves the right to modify the asphalt-rubber content
 without compensation being made to the contractor involving additional
 operation costs.

 Ac c e p t a n c e o f M a t e r i a l s :
 
 413-6.01
 
 General:
 
 The contractor's attention is directed to the requirements of
 Subsection 105.13, Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized W ork.
 If the production of asphaltic concrete is stopped either for failure to
 meet the requirements specified in Subsection 413-6.03 or because
 changes are made in the mix design, samples will be taken for
 calculating new consecutive averages either after production resumes
 or after the changes in the mix design have been made.
 The
 acceptance of the mineral aggregate gradation and the bituminous
 material content will be determined on the basis of the tests specified
 in Subsection 413-6.03. The Engineer reserves the right to increase
 the frequency of sampling and testing upon the resumption of asphaltic
 concrete production.
 413-6.02
 
 M i n e r a l Ag g r e g a t e :
 
 Aggregate shall be free of deleterious materials, clay balls, and
 adhering films or other materials that prevent thorough coating of the
 aggregate with the bituminous material.
 Prior to and during asphaltic concrete production, the Engineer shall
 obtain and test samples of mineral aggregate for the determination of
 
 334
 
 SECTION 413
 the sand equivalent and fractured coarse aggregate particles. Samples
 shall be obtained from the cold feed belt prior to addition of mineral

 Prior to the initial startup of asphaltic concrete production, and prior to
 startup after any subsequent mix design revisions affecting gradation, a
 sample of the combined mineral aggregate shall be tested. The mineral
 aggregate shall meet the gradation requirements for the 3-consecutive
 test limits indicated below. If the mineral aggregate does not meet
 these requirements, production shall not begin until the mineral
 aggregate is in compliance with this requirement.

 one sample of mineral aggregate will be taken. Samples will be taken
 in accordance with the requirements of Arizona Test Method 105 on a
 random basis. For batch plants, the sample shall be taken from the hot
 bins. For plants other than batch plants, the sample shall be taken
 from the cold feed belt. Samples will be taken by means of a sampling
 device which is capable of obtaining representative samples.
 The
 device, which shall be approved by the Engineer, shall be furnished by
 the contractor. In any shift that the production of asphaltic concrete is
 less than 500 tons, at least one sample will be taken.
 Samples will be tested for conformance with the mix design gradation,

 SECTION 413
 At any time that test results indicate that the gradation does not fall
 within all of the limits indicated, the production of asphaltic concrete
 shall cease immediately and shall not begin again until a calibration
 test indicates that the gradation is within the 3-consecutive test limits
 indicated.

 As p h a l t - R u b b e r C o n t e n t :
 
 During production of asphaltic concrete, the contractor shall maintain at
 the plant site a nuclear asphalt content gauge calibrated and operated
 in accordance with Arizona Test Method 421. At the discretion of the
 Engineer, the Department may choose to prepare the calibration
 samples for use by the contractor.
 Under the observation of the
 Engineer, the contractor shall determine the asphalt-rubber content by
 means of the nuclear asphalt content gauge a minimum of four times
 per full shift. The Engineer shall determine the times that the samples
 are taken.
 The contractor’s technicians performing the testing,
 including the calibration of the nuclear gauge, shall meet the technician
 requirements given in the Department’s System for the Evaluation of
 Testing Laboratories. The requirements may be obtained from ADOT

 Production of asphaltic concrete shall cease immediately and the plant
 and/or the nuclear asphalt content gauges re-calibrated if any single
 test result varies by an amount greater than ± 0.60, or the average of
 three consecutive test results varies by an amount greater than ± 0.40,
 from the amount directed by the Engineer. Material that has already
 been produced may be used on the project if the single test value
 representative of that material varies by an amount from ± 0.61
 to ± 0.75, inclusive, from the amount directed by the Engineer.
 Material that has already been produced may not be used on the project
 if the single test value representative of that material varies by an
 amount greater than ± 0.75 from the amount directed by the Engineer
 unless, by retesting, the material is found to be acceptable.

 and witnessed by the Engineer so that both parties are satisfied that
 samples are representative of the mineral aggregate to be utilized in
 the asphaltic concrete production.
 In addition to the mineral aggregate samples, the contractor shall also
 furnish the Engineer with representative samples of the following
 materials: a five-pound sample of the crumb rubber proposed for use,
 one gallon of asphalt cement from the intended supplier, three gallons
 o f t h e p r o p o s e d m i xt u r e o f a s p h a l t a n d r u b b e r , a n d a o n e - g a l l o n c a n o f
 t h e p r o p o s e d m i n e r a l a d m i xt u r e .
 These materials must be
 representative of the material which will subsequently be used in the
 production of asphaltic concrete.
 If the mineral aggregate does not meet the requirements of
 Subsection 414-3.01, no mix design will be prepared. The contractor
 shall take the necessary steps to provide material meeting the specified
 requirements.
 Along with the samples furnished for mix design testing, the contractor
 s h a l l s u b m i t a l e t t e r e xp l a i n i n g i n d e t a i l i t s m e t h o d s o f p r o d u c i n g

 The contract time established for the completion of the work includes
 10 working days for the required testing and the developing of the
 approved mix design.
 Asphaltic concrete friction course production shall not begin until there
 is an approved mix design.
 414-5
 
 Mix Design Revisions:
 
 At any time after production of asphaltic concrete has been started
 using the approved mix design, changes may be proposed by the
 contractor or directed by the Engineer.
 The contractor shall not change its methods of crushing, screening,
 washing, or stockpiling from those used during production of material
 used for mix design purposes without approval of the Engineer, or
 without requesting a new mix design.
 If changes are made in the source or type of bituminous material or the
 source(s) of mineral aggregate, or changes are made in the proportions
 of mineral aggregate equal to or greater than five percentage points,
 a d d i t i o n a l t e s t i n g t o t h e e xt e n t d e e m e d n e c e s s a r y b y t h e E n g i n e e r w i l l
 be performed in order that the Engineer may be satisfied that the mix
 design criteria will be met.
 During production of asphaltic concrete, the contractor, on the basis of
 field test results, may request a change to the approved mix design.
 The Engineer will evaluate the proposed changes and notify the
 contractor of the Engineer’s decision within two working days of the
 receipt of the request.
 If, at any time, unapproved changes are made by the contractor in the
 source of bituminous material, source(s) of mineral aggregate,
 production methods, or proportional changes in violation of approved
 mix design stipulations, production shall cease until a new mix design
 is developed at no additional cost to the Department, or the contractor
 complies with the approved mix design.
 At any time after the mix design has been approved, the contractor may
 request a new mix design. The costs associated with the testing of
 materials in the developing of mix designs requested by the contractor
 after a mix design acceptable to the Department has been developed
 shall be borne by the contractor.
 If the Engineer determines that a new mix design is necessary due to
 changes in mineral aggregate characteristics or gradation, costs
 
 347
 
 SECTION 414
 associated with the development of the new mix design shall be borne
 by the contractor.
 A new mix design can be developed by the Engineer at any time the
 Engineer deems necessary. Should such a new mix design require
 revisions to the contractor's operations which result in additional cost
 to the contractor, it will be reimbursed for these costs. However, the
 Engineer reserves the right to modify the asphalt-rubber content
 without compensation being made to the contractor involving additional
 operation costs.

 General:
 
 The contractor's attention is directed to the requirements of
 Subsection 105.13, Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized W ork.
 If the production of asphaltic concrete is stopped either for failure to
 meet the requirements specified in Subsection 414-6.03 or because
 changes are made in the mix design, samples will be taken for
 calculating new consecutive averages either after production resumes
 or after the changes in the mix design have been made.
 The
 acceptance of the mineral aggregate gradation and the bituminous
 material content will be determined on the basis of the tests specified
 in Subsection 414-6.03. The Engineer reserves the right to increase
 the frequency of sampling and testing upon the resumption of asphaltic
 concrete production.
 414-6.02
 
 M i n e r a l Ag g r e g a t e :
 
 Aggregate shall be free of deleterious materials, clay balls, and
 adhering films or other material that prevent thorough coating of the
 aggregate with the bituminous material.
 Prior to and during asphaltic concrete production, the Engineer shall
 obtain and test samples of mineral aggregate for the determination of
 the sand equivalent, fractured coarse aggregate particles, and flakiness

 Prior to the initial startup of asphaltic concrete production, and prior to
 startup after any subsequent mix design revisions affecting gradation, a
 sample of the combined mineral aggregate shall be tested. The mineral
 aggregate shall meet the gradation requirements for the 3-consecutive
 test limits indicated below. If the mineral aggregate does not meet
 these requirements, production shall not begin until the mineral
 aggregate is in compliance with this requirement.

 dedicated for the shift of asphaltic concrete production.
 The
 determination of the actual asphalt-rubber content may include invoice
 quantities, volumetric tank measurements using a calibrated rod (tank
 stickings) corrected for temperature, computerized mass-flow meter,
 and accounting for wasted materials.
 If a computerized mass-flow
 meter is used, documentation of its calibration shall be submitted to the
 Engineer prior to asphaltic concrete production. At any time during
 asphaltic concrete production, the Engineer may require that a new
 calibration of the mass-flow meter be performed.
 If there is a
 difference of greater than 0.1 percent asphalt-rubber content between
 the asphalt-rubber content measured by ignition furnace testing and the
 actual asphalt-rubber content, the contractor may request that a
 correction to the asphalt-rubber content by ignition furnace testing be
 made. The contractor must make such a request in writing within two
 working days after receiving the test results for the fifth lot of asphaltic
 concrete production.
 If referee testing is performed on a lot of
 asphaltic concrete for which a correction, based on the actual
 asphalt-rubber content, was made to the asphalt-rubber content by
 ignition furnace testing, referee testing shall not apply to the
 determination of asphalt-rubber content.
 The correction, once
 documented and approved by the Engineer, shall be applied to test
 results from the beginning of asphaltic concrete production through the
 remainder of asphaltic concrete production using that mix design. If
 the contractor submits a new mix design, a new correction must be
 established and applied as specified above.
 For other plants, no
 correction will be made to asphalt-rubber content values measured by
 ignition furnace testing.
 Acceptance testing results will be furnished to the contractor within
 four working days of receipt of samples by the Engineer.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the test results obtained
 for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to the
 contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor may
 make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The referee
 testing shall be performed in an independent approved laboratory
 designated by the Engineer.
 The testing of the samples will be
 performed by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of

 A lot for compaction purposes shall be identical to the lot described in
 Subsection 415-7.04. Lots encompassing more than one project shall
 be separated in accordance with Subsection 415-9 (D). Each lot shall
 be tested for acceptance.
 Twenty cores shall be taken for each lot by the contractor, under the
 observation of the Engineer. Cores shall be taken using wet coring
 with soapy water to aid in the release of the core from the coring
 equipment. The Engineer will designate ten random locations within
 the lot and the contractor shall take two cores at each location. The
 Engineer will save one core from each location for 15 days after written
 notification to the contractor of test results for that lot has been made.
 Randomly selected locations will be determined to the nearest one-half
 foot in the transverse direction and to the nearest one foot in the
 longitudinal direction of the pavement course; however, the outside one

 and shall be taken not later than two working days after the lot
 placement. The cores shall be delivered to the Engineer immediately
 upon being taken.
 The cores will be tested for acceptance by the
 Engineer in accordance with the requirements of Arizona Test Method
 415. Acceptance testing results will be furnished to the contractor
 within four working days of receipt of samples by the Engineer.
 The target value for compaction shall be 7.0 percent in-place air voids.
 In-place air voids shall be determined using Arizona Test Method 424.

 The Upper Limit (UL) is 9.0 percent in-place air voids and the Lower
 Limit (LL) is 4.0 percent in-place air voids.
 The Engineer will
 determine the PT for compaction in accordance with Subsection 4159(I), and utilizing Table 415-4 will determine the compaction pay factor.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the core test results
 obtained for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to
 the contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor
 may make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The cores
 previously saved will be tested in accordance with the requirements of
 Arizona Test Method 415 in an independent testing laboratory
 designated by the Engineer. The testing of the cores will be performed
 by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of the specific
 project conditions, such as the identity of the contractor or mix design
 laboratory, the test results by the Department, or the density target.
 Using the referee test results, the Engineer will determine a new PT for
 
 373
 
 SECTION 415
 compaction. The result of this determination will be binding on both the
 contractor and the Department.
 The Department will pay for this
 testing; however, if the compaction pay factor of the lot does not
 improve, is reduced, or the lot remains in reject, payment to the
 contractor for asphaltic concrete shall be reduced by the amount of the
 cost of this testing.
 415-7.06
 
 Smoothness and Surface Tolerances:
 
 All courses of asphaltic concrete shall be compacted as required,
 smooth and true to the required lines, grades, and dimensions.
 The Special Provisions may require the smoothness of the final
 pavement surface to be tested in accordance with Subsection 109.13.
 Regardless of whether testing in accordance with Subsection 109.13 is
 specified or not, the following requirements shall be met:
 (1)
 
 The surface of the final lift of asphaltic concrete placed under
 this section of the specifications shall be tested and shall not
 vary by more than 1/8 inch from the lower edge of a ten-foot
 straightedge when it is placed in the longitudinal direction
 (including across transverse joints), and when it is placed in the
 transverse direction across longitudinal joints.
 
 (2)
 
 The surface of any lift of asphaltic concrete placed under this
 section of the specifications, other than the final lift, shall be
 tested and shall not vary by more than 1/4 inch from the lower
 edge of a ten-foot straightedge when it is placed in the
 longitudinal direction (including across transverse joints), and
 when it is placed in the transverse direction across longitudinal
 joints.

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Asphaltic concrete will be measured by the ton for the asphaltic
 concrete actually used, which will include the weight of mineral
 a g g r e g a t e , a s p h a l t - r u b b e r , a n d m i n e r a l a d m i xt u r e . M e a s u r e m e n t w i l l
 include any quantity used in construction of intersections, turnouts, or
 other miscellaneous items or surfaces.
 Asphalt-rubber will be measured by the ton on the basis of the
 asphalt-rubber content determined in accordance with Subsection 4157.04 for each lot of asphaltic concrete accepted.
 The average
 asphalt-rubber content will be multiplied by the number of tons of
 asphaltic concrete in that lot to determine the amount of
 asphalt-rubber. If the contractor has requested referee testing, the
 average asphalt-rubber content will come from the independent testing
 laboratory results, unless a correction, based on the actual
 
 374
 
 SECTION 415
 asphalt-rubber content, was made to the ignition furnace test value as
 allowed in Subsection 415-7.04. If a correction, based on the actual
 asphalt-rubber content, was made to the ignition furnace test value, the
 average asphalt-rubber content determined from the Department's
 acceptance testing will be used. At the discretion of the Engineer,
 asphalt-rubber may be measured by invoice quantities, adjusted as
 necessary for waste.
 In no case shall the measured amount of
 asphalt-rubber for payment be greater than the total of the invoice
 quantities, adjusted for waste.

 The accepted quantities of asphaltic concrete, measured as provided
 above, will be paid for at the contract unit price adjusted by the
 appropriate total pay factor as hereinafter provided.
 For the purpose of determining acceptability and appropriate total pay
 factors, each unit of asphaltic concrete will be included in three
 separate lots:
 a " s p r e a d l o t , " a " m i xt u r e p r o p e r t i e s l o t , " a n d a

 Mineral aggregate will be acceptable for sand equivalent if it meets the
 minimum requirements specified in Subsection 416-3.01 and the
 running average of three sand equivalent tests is at least 90 percent
 and no single test is less than 80 percent of the sand equivalent result
 contained in the contractor’s mix design.
 The fractured coarse aggregate particles shall meet the minimum
 requirements specified in Subsection 416-3.01.

 the uncrushed and crushed fine aggregate for uncompacted void
 content will be required if the method of producing either fine aggregate
 is modified.
 If the mineral aggregate fails to meet the requirements specified
 herein, operations shall cease and the contractor shall have the option
 of submitting a revised mix design conforming to the requirements of
 Subsection 416-4 or correcting deficiencies in the aggregate stockpiles.
 416-7.03
 
 Material Spread:
 
 A spread lot shall be considered to be one-half shift of production.
 Lots encompassing more than one project shall be separated in
 accordance with Subsection 416-9(D).
 The contractor shall record information pertaining to each spread lot on
 forms provided by the Engineer. Information shall include the project
 number, date and period of time that each spread lot was placed, the
 
 391
 
 SECTION 416
 spread lot number, beginning and ending station, the plans thickness,
 and tons placed in each lot.
 Completed spread lot forms shall be
 signed by the contractor and given to the Engineer at the end of each
 shift.
 The Engineer will calculate the quantity required in each spread lot
 using the mix design bulk density.
 The calculated quantity required in each spread lot will be compared to
 the actual quantity placed. A lot will be considered to be acceptable,
 with a zero pay factor, if the actual quantity placed varies by no more
 than -2.0 to +5.0 percent from the required quantity.
 If the quantity in a lot is found to vary between -2.0 and -12.0 percent,
 pay factors will be determined in accordance with Table 416-1. These
 pay factors will be utilized in the pay adjustment as outlined in
 Subsection 416-9.

 A lot shall be considered to be one shift's production; however,
 production consisting of less than one shift, such as at the beginning or
 at the completion of production will also be considered to be a lot. If
 changes are made in the mix design, new lots will be established.
 Four samples of the asphaltic concrete shall be taken for each lot by
 the contractor, under the observation of the Engineer, at random
 locations designated by the Engineer.
 Samples shall be taken in
 accordance with the requirements of Section 2 or 3 of Arizona Test
 Method 104 and delivered to the Engineer immediately after being
 taken. The minimum weight of the sample shall be 75 pounds. The
 Engineer will split the sample and save one-half for 15 days after
 written notification to the contractor of test results for that lot has been
 made. The material will be tested by the Engineer for asphalt cement

 dedicated for the shift of asphaltic concrete production.
 The
 
 392
 
 SECTION 416
 determination of the actual asphalt cement content may include
 weighing of asphalt cement deliveries, invoice quantities, volumetric
 tank measurements using a calibrated rod (tank stickings) corrected for
 temperature, computerized mass-flow meter, and accounting for wasted
 materials. If a computerized mass-flow meter is used, documentation
 of its calibration shall be submitted to the Engineer prior to asphaltic
 concrete production. At any time during asphaltic concrete production,
 the Engineer may require that a new calibration of the mass-flow meter
 be performed.
 If there is a difference of greater than 0.1 percent
 asphalt cement content between the asphalt cement content measured
 by ignition furnace testing and the actual asphalt cement content, the
 contractor may request that a correction to the asphalt cement content
 by ignition furnace testing be made. The contractor must make such a
 request in writing within two working days after receiving the test
 results for the fifth lot of asphaltic concrete production. If referee
 testing is performed on a lot of asphaltic concrete for which a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the asphalt cement content by ignition furnace testing, referee testing
 shall not apply to the determination of asphalt cement content. The
 correction, once documented and approved by the Engineer, shall be
 applied to test results from the beginning of asphaltic concrete
 production through the remainder of asphaltic concrete production
 using that mix design. If the contractor submits a new mix design, a
 new correction must be established and applied as specified above.
 For other plants, no correction will be made to asphalt cement content
 values measured by ignition furnace testing.
 Acceptance testing results will be furnished to the contractor within
 four working days of receipt of samples by the Engineer.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the test results obtained
 for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to the
 contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor may
 make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The referee
 testing shall be performed in an independent approved laboratory
 designated by the Engineer.
 The testing of the samples will be
 performed by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of
 the specific project conditions such as the identity of the contractor or
 mix design laboratory, the tests results by the Department, or the mix
 design targets for gradation and effective voids. The asphaltic concrete
 samples previously saved will be tested for Marshall density and

 The results of these determinations will be binding on both the
 contractor and the Department.
 The Department will pay for this

 anticipated performance in accordance with Subsection 416-9(E).
 Production shall cease until the contractor proposes a corrective action
 the Engineer finds acceptable. If the Engineer rejects the proposed
 corrective action, the contractor shall submit a revised mix design.
 The target values for gradation, asphalt cement content, and effective
 voids are given in the contractor’s mix design. The Upper Limits (UL)
 and Lower Limits (LL) of acceptable production of each of the measured
 characteristics are as follows:

 Regardless of whether testing in accordance with Subsection 109.13 is
 specified or not, the following requirements shall be met:
 (1) The surface of the final lift of asphaltic concrete placed under
 this section of the specifications shall be tested and shall not
 vary by more than 1/8 inch from the lower edge of a ten-foot
 straightedge when it is placed in the longitudinal direction
 (including across transverse joints), and when it is placed in the
 transverse direction across longitudinal joints.
 (2) The surface of any lift of asphaltic concrete placed under this
 section of the specifications, other than the final lift, shall be
 tested and shall not vary by more than 1/4 inch from the lower
 edge of a ten-foot straightedge when it is placed in the
 longitudinal direction (including across transverse joints), and
 when it is placed in the transverse direction across longitudinal
 joints.

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Asphaltic concrete will be measured by the ton for the asphaltic
 concrete actually used, which will include the weight of mineral
 a g g r e g a t e , a s p h a l t c e m e n t , a n d m i n e r a l a d m i xt u r e . M e a s u r e m e n t w i l l
 include any quantity used in construction of intersections, turnouts, or
 other miscellaneous items or surfaces.
 Asphalt cement will be measured by the ton on the basis of the asphalt
 cement content determined in accordance with Subsection 416-7.04 for
 each lot of asphaltic concrete accepted. The average asphalt cement
 content will be multiplied by the number of tons of asphaltic concrete in
 that lot to determine the amount of asphalt cement. If the contractor
 has requested referee testing, the average asphalt cement content will
 come from the independent testing laboratory results unless a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value as allowed in Subsection 416-7.04. If a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value, the average asphalt cement content
 determined from the Department's acceptance testing will be used. At
 the discretion of the Engineer, asphalt cement may be measured by
 invoice quantities, adjusted as necessary for waste. In no case shall
 the measured amount of asphalt cement for payment be greater than
 the total of the invoice quantities, adjusted for waste.

 SECTION 417
 The Engineer will calculate the quantity required in each spread lot
 using the mix design bulk density.
 The calculated quantity required in each spread lot will be compared to
 the actual quantity placed. A lot will be considered to be acceptable,
 with a zero pay factor, if the actual quantity placed varies by no more
 than -2.0 to +5.0 percent from the required quantity.
 If the quantity in a lot is found to vary between - 2.0 and - 12.0 percent,
 pay factors will be determined in accordance with Table 417-3. These
 pay factors will be utilized in the pay adjustment as outlined in
 Subsection 417-9.

 changes are made in the mix design, new lots will be established.
 Four samples of the asphaltic concrete shall be taken for each lot by
 the contractor, under the observation of the Engineer, at random
 locations designated by the Engineer.
 Samples shall be taken in
 accordance with the requirements of Section 2 or 3 of Arizona Test
 Method 104 and delivered to the Engineer immediately after being

 The
 determination of the actual asphalt cement content may include
 weighing of asphalt cement deliveries, invoice quantities, volumetric

 SECTION 417
 of its calibration shall be submitted to the Engineer prior to asphaltic
 concrete production. At any time during asphaltic concrete production,
 the Engineer may require that a new calibration of the mass-flow meter
 be performed.
 If there is a difference of greater than 0.1 percent
 asphalt cement content between the asphalt cement content measured
 by ignition furnace testing and the actual asphalt cement content, the
 contractor may request that a correction to the asphalt cement content
 by ignition furnace testing be made. The contractor must make such a
 request in writing within two working days after receiving the test
 results for the fifth lot of asphaltic concrete production. If referee
 testing is performed on a lot of asphaltic concrete for which a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the asphalt cement content by ignition furnace testing, referee testing
 shall not apply to the determination of asphalt cement content. The
 correction, once documented and approved by the Engineer, shall be
 applied to test results from the beginning of asphaltic concrete
 production through the remainder of asphaltic concrete production
 using that mix design. If the contractor submits a new mix design, a
 new correction must be established and applied as specified above.
 For other plants, no correction will be made to asphalt cement content
 values measured by ignition furnace testing.
 Acceptance testing results will be furnished to the contractor within
 four working days of receipt of samples by the Engineer.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the test results obtained
 for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to the
 contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor may
 make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The referee
 testing shall be performed in an independent approved laboratory
 designated by the Engineer.
 The testing of the samples will be
 performed by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of
 the specific project conditions such as the identity of the contractor or
 mix design laboratory, the tests results by the Department, or the mix
 design targets for gradation and effective voids.

 final lift is placed, and the compaction density shall be based on the
 full depth of the lifts.
 The target value for compaction shall be 7.0 percent in-place air voids.
 In-place air voids shall be determined using Arizona Test Method 424.

 Subsection 417-7.04.
 The Upper Limit (UL) is 9.0 percent in-place air voids and the
 Lower Limit (LL) is 4.0 percent in-place air voids. The Engineer will
 determine the PT for compaction in accordance with Subsection 4179(I) and, utilizing Table 417-3, will determine the compaction pay
 factor.
 In the event the contractor elects to question the core test results
 obtained for a particular lot, within 15 days after written notification to
 the contractor of test results for that lot has been made, the contractor
 may make a written request for referee testing of that lot. The cores
 previously saved will be tested in accordance with the requirements of
 Arizona Test Method 415 in an independent testing laboratory
 designated by the Engineer. The testing of the cores will be performed
 by the independent testing laboratory without knowledge of the specific
 project conditions, such as the identity of the contractor or mix design
 laboratory, the test results by the Department, or the density target.
 Using the referee test results, the Engineer will determine a new PT for
 compaction. The result of this determination will be binding on both the
 contractor and the Department.
 The Department will pay for this
 testing; however, if the compaction pay factor of the lot does not
 improve, is reduced, or the lot remains in reject, payment to the
 contractor for asphaltic concrete shall be reduced by the amount of the
 cost of this testing.
 417-7.06
 
 Smoothness and Surface Tolerances:
 
 Asphaltic concrete shall be compacted as required, smooth and true to
 the required lines, grades, and dimensions.
 The Special Provisions may require the smoothness of the final
 pavement surface to be tested in accordance with Subsection 109.13.
 Regardless of whether testing in accordance with Subsection 109.13 is
 specified or not, the following requirements shall be met:
 (1)
 
 The surface of the

 (including across transverse joints), and when it is placed in the
 transverse direction across longitudinal joints.
 (2)
 
 The surface of any lift of asphaltic concrete placed under this
 section of the specifications, other than the final lift, shall be
 tested and shall not vary by more than 1/4 inch from the lower
 edge of a ten-foot straightedge when it is placed in the
 longitudinal direction (including across transverse joints), and
 when it is placed in the transverse direction across longitudinal
 joints.

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Asphaltic concrete will be measured by the ton for the asphaltic
 concrete actually used, which will include the weight of mineral
 a g g r e g a t e , a s p h a l t c e m e n t , a n d m i n e r a l a d m i xt u r e . M e a s u r e m e n t w i l l
 include any quantity used in construction of intersections, turnouts, or
 other miscellaneous items or surfaces.
 Asphalt cement will be measured by the ton on the basis of the asphalt
 cement content determined in accordance with Subsection 417-7.04 for
 each lot of asphaltic concrete accepted. The average asphalt cement
 content will be multiplied by the number of tons of asphaltic concrete in
 that lot to determine the amount of asphalt cement. If the contractor
 has requested referee testing, the average asphalt cement content will
 come from the independent testing laboratory results, unless a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value as allowed in Subsection 417-7.04. If a
 correction, based on the actual asphalt cement content, was made to
 the ignition furnace test value, the average asphalt cement content
 determined from the Department's acceptance testing will be used. At
 the discretion of the Engineer, asphalt cement may be measured by
 invoice quantities, adjusted as necessary for waste. In no case shall
 the measured amount of asphalt cement for payment be greater than
 the total of the invoice quantities, adjusted for waste.

 Falsework and Forms:
 Design and Drawings:
 
 The contractor shall be responsible for designing and constructing safe
 and adequate falsework and forms which provide the necessary rigidity,
 support the loads imposed, and produce in the finished structure the
 lines, grades, and dimensions shown on the project plans and
 established by the Engineer.
 Forms shall be any system of structural elements which provides
 horizontal support or restraint to the lateral pressure of concrete.
 Falsework shall be any system of structural elements that provides
 temporary support for loads from plastic concrete, forms, reinforcing
 steel, structural steel, loads from placement operations or other related
 loads, and continues to provide support until the concrete has attained
 adequate strength and the structure is capable of self-support.
 The design load for falsework shall consist of the sum of dead and live
 vertical loads, and an assumed horizontal load. The minimum total
 design load for any falsework shall be not less than 100 pounds per
 square foot for the combined live and dead load regardless of slab
 thickness.
 Dead loads shall include the weight of concrete, reinforcing steel,
 forms and falsework. The weight of concrete, reinforcing steel and
 forms shall be assumed to be not less than 160 pounds per cubic foot
 for normal concrete and not less than 130 pounds per cubic foot for
 lightweight concrete.
 Live loads shall consist of the actual weight of any equipment to be
 supported by falsework applied as concentrated loads at the points of
 contact and a uniform load of not less than 50 pounds per square foot
 applied over the area supported.
 The assumed horizontal load to be resisted by the falsework bracing
 system shall be the sum of the actual horizontal loads due to
 equipment, construction sequence or other causes and an allowance for
 wind, but in no case shall the assumed horizontal load to be resisted in
 any direction be less than two percent of the total dead load. The
 falsework shall be designed so that it will have sufficient rigidity to
 resist the assumed horizontal load without considering the weight of the
 concrete.
 473
 
 SECTION 601
 If the concrete is to be prestressed, the falsework shall be designed to
 support any increased or readjusted loads caused by prestressing
 forces.
 Falsework shall be designed by the working stress design method, and

 falsework beam span irrespective of the fact that the deflection may be
 compensated for by camber strips.
 In the case of post-tensioned structures, the falsework deflections shall
 not produce stresses in the structure at any time prior to
 post-tensioning greater than 0.8 times the modulus of rupture for plain
 concrete unless approved by the Engineer.
 Falsework over or adjacent to roadways or railroads which are open to
 traffic shall be designed and constructed so that the falsework will be
 stable if subjected to impact by vehicles.
 Falsework posts which
 support members that cross over a roadway or railroad shall be
 considered as adjacent to roadways or railroads. Other falsework posts
 shall be considered as adjacent to roadways or railroads only if they
 are located in the row of falsework posts nearest to the roadway or
 railroad and the horizontal distance from the traffic side of the
 falsework to the edge of pavement or to a point 10 feet from the
 centerline of track is less than the total height of the falsework and
 forms.
 The vertical load used for the design of falsework posts and towers, but
 not footings, which support the portion of the falsework over openings,
 shall be increased to not less than 150 percent of the design load
 calculated in accordance with the provisions for design load previously
 specified.
 Falsework posts adjacent to roadways or railroads shall consist of

 cap or framing.
 Such mechanical connections shall be capable of
 resisting a load in any direction, including uplift on the stringer, of not
 less than 500 pounds.
 Such connections shall be installed before
 traffic is allowed to pass beneath the span. For falsework spans over
 railroads, all falsework stringers shall be so connected to caps.
 W hen timber members are used to brace falsework bents which are
 located adjacent to roadways or railroads, all connections for such
 timber bracing shall be of the bolted type using 5/8 inch diameter or
 larger bolts, or shall be connected in a manner that will equal
 100 percent capacity of the smaller member connected.
 The falsework shall be located so that falsework footings or piles are at

 the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel.
 W orking force will be considered as the force remaining in the
 prestressing steel after all losses, including creep and shrinkage of
 concrete, elastic compression of concrete, losses in prestressing steel
 due to sequence of stressing, friction, and all other losses peculiar to
 the method or system of prestressing have taken place or have been
 provided for.
 All prestressing steel shall be tensioned with hydraulic jacks so that the
 force in the prestressing steel shall not be less than the value shown
 on the project plans. Each jack used shall be equipped with either a
 pressure gauge or a load cell to determine the jacking force. All jacks
 and gauges shall be calibrated as a unit and shall be accompanied by a
 certified calibration chart.
 All gauges shall be either a reading dial at least six inches in diameter
 or a digital display indicator. The increments shown on the reading dial

 display indicator shall be readable by normal vision at a distance
 greater than 10 feet. All gauges shall show a load accuracy of one
 percent of the load, from one percent to one hundred percent of the
 capacity of the gauge.
 The certified calibration charts for the hydraulic jacks and pressure
 gauges may be checked before and during jacking operations with
 505
 
 SECTION 602
 Department-furnished load cells. If the certified calibration is found to
 be in error, the operation shall be immediately discontinued until a new
 certified calibration is performed by the contractor.
 W elding or a welding ground shall not be done near prestressing steel
 and ducts.
 W elding near prestressed work shall be done only if
 specified on the project plans or directed by the Engineer.
 The tensioning process shall be so conducted that the force being
 applied and the elongation of the prestressing steel may be measured
 at all times. The actual elongation obtained from the calibrated force
 value shall be compared with the theoretical calculated elongation. If
 the actual measured elongation differs by more than five percent of the
 theoretical calculated elongation, the entire operation shall be carefully
 checked and the source of the error determined and corrected before
 proceeding with the tensioning. A record of the prestressing force and
 elongations shall be kept at all times and submitted to the Engineer for
 approval.
 (B)
 
 Pretensioning Precast Concrete:
 
 The tensioning force in pretensioned strands shall not be transferred to
 the member until tests on cylinder specimens made and cured under the
 same conditions as the member indicates the required compressive
 release strength has been attained. This shall constitute the end of the
 curing period.
 Detensioning shall be performed immediately following the curing
 period if the concrete has been heat-cured. The release of the strands
 shall be from one or both ends of the casting bed depending upon which
 method will produce the least movement of members in the casting bed
 and the least horizontal eccentricity of the initial prestressing force in
 the member.
 All pretensioned members shall be tensioned either by single strand or
 multiple strand jacks.
 Jacking the prestressing steel shall be performed in two increments.
 An initial tension shall be applied to the strands to straighten them, to
 eliminate slack and provide a starting or reference point for measuring
 elongation. The final tension shall then be applied and elongation of
 strands measured.
 Anchoring devices shall be capable of holding strands with a minimum
 of differential slippage.
 Stringing of following lengths of strand
 incorporating points previously gripped within lengths to be stressed
 will not be permitted. Any rotation of the strand shall be limited to not
 m o r e t h a n o n e r e v o l u t i o n p e r 1 0 0 f e e t o f e xp o s e d s t r a n d .
 Splicing of strands will be permitted but only one splice per strand will
 be allowed. Strands to be spliced shall have the same lay or direction
 of twist. Splicing will not be permitted within the member.
 506
 
 SECTION 602
 W hen ordered by the Engineer, prestressing strands in precast
 members, if tensioned individually, shall be checked by the contractor
 for loss of force not more than three hours prior to placing concrete for
 the members. The method and equipment for checking the loss of force
 shall be subject to approval by the Engineer. All strands which show a
 l o s s o f p r e s t r e s s i n e xc e s s o f t h r e e p e r c e n t s h a l l b e r e t e n s i o n e d t o t h e
 original jacking force.
 W hen concrete has not been placed within seventy-two hours of the
 tensioning of the prestressing strands, retensioning of all strands will
 be required prior to placing of the concrete.
 (C)
 
 Post-Tensioning Cast-in-Place Concrete:
 
 Prestressing steel for post-tensioning, which is installed in structures
 prior to placing and curing of the concrete, shall be continuously
 protected against rust or other corrosion until grouted by means of an
 approved corrosion inhibitor placed in the ducts or applied to the steel
 in the duct. If the strands are in the duct at the time concrete is
 placed, no tensioning will be allowed until it is demonstrated to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer that the prestressing strands are free and
 unbonded in the duct.
 W hen prestressing steel for post-tensioning is installed in the ducts
 after completion of concrete curing, and if stressing and grouting are
 completed within 10 calendar days after the installation of the

 At t a c h m e n t o f C h a r a c t e r s a n d B o r d e r s :
 
 Self plugging aluminum, protruding, regular head blind rivets shall be
 used to secure all demountable characters. The rivets shall conform to
 the applicable requirements of International Fasteners Institute (IFI)
 114 standard for break mandrel blind rivets. All rivets shall be 5/32
 inch in diameter with the appropriate grip range.
 Rivets shall be either IFI 114 Grade 10 or 11 aluminum alloy rivets.
 The rivets shall have an ultimate shear and tensile strength that has
 been determined by IFI 135 Specification 2.1 and 2.2. The ultimate
 s h e a r a n d t e n s i l e s t r e n g t h s h a l l m e e t o r e xc e e d t h o s e v a l u e s s p e c i f i e d
 for a 5/32 inch (0.1562) nominal rivet diameter per IFI 114 Table 6 for
 Grades 10 or 11. A higher strength and grade aluminum rivet can be
 used at the option of the sign fabricator.
 Rivets securing the characters to the back panel shall be of sufficient
 length to ensure a secure attachment and conform to the grip length
 specifications of the rivet manufacturer. The determination of rivet grip
 length shall include the total thickness of the joint. This thickness
 shall include the character (sheeting and aluminum sheet), spacer (if
 a p p l i c a b l e ) a n d t h e s i g n b a c k p a n e l ( s h e e t i n g a n d a l u m i n u m e xt r u s i o n ) .
 The hole size used to install the rivets shall conform to the
 recommendation of the rivet manufacturer and Table 2 of IFI 114.
 Rivets shall be placed a minimum of four times the diameter of the rivet
 from the edge of the character being attached, e.g., 5/8 inch clearance
 for a 5/32 inch diameter rivet. Clearance shall be measured to the
 outside of the rivet head.
 Minimum requirements for attaching demountable characters shall be as
 follows:
 Straight numerals and letters such as "1" shall have three rivets, one at
 the top, middle and bottom. The more complex numerals and letters
 shall have from four to seven rivets. Letters such as "W " and "M"
 typically require seven rivets. Letters and numerals such as "P", "H"
 and "9" typically require six rivets. Letters and numerals such as "G",
 "S", "2", "3" and "7" typically require five rivets. A rivet shall secure
 each corner of the letter or numeral. For shields and symbols, rivets
 shall be spaced evenly around the entire perimeter. Additional rivets
 shall be added in the middle of the shield or symbol as necessary to
 eliminate bowing. Rivets for borders shall be spaced evenly around the
 border.
 550
 
 SECTION 608
 The actual number of rivets used will depend on the thickness,
 configuration, weight, position (with or without spacers), size of the
 character being attached, and the recommendations of the rivet
 manufacturer. The number and location of rivets shall be sufficient to
 secure the character to the panel so it shall not miss-align, bend or
 move when subjected to wind loading.
 Additionally, the number of
 rivets used shall ensure that the character does not bow or pull away
 from the back panel for the life of the sign. Rivets shall be placed in a
 defined, evenly spaced pattern which is consistent from character to
 character. The placement and pattern of rivets shall not interfere with
 the appearance of the sign from normal drive-by viewing distances.
 The contractor shall supply standard punch details prior to fabrication.
 The protruding head and shaft of the rivets shall closely match the
 color of the character on which they are being applied, e.g., black
 characters shall be applied with black rivets. Aluminum colored rivets
 are acceptable for mounting white characters.
 The coating used to color the rivets shall be a factory-applied anodized
 type finish, or equivalent, that is suitable for long term outdoor
 application. The coating shall have durable colorfastness and shall be

 Construction Requirements:
 
 609-3.01
 
 General:
 
 The methods and equipment used shall be appropriate for the intended
 purpose and materials encountered. The allowable methods are the dry
 method, wet method, temporary casing method or permanent casing
 method, as defined by AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway
 Bridges, Division II, Section 5. The most suitable of the listed methods
 for the conditions recorded in the geotechnical investigation report, or
 a combination of these methods, shall be used, subject to approval of
 the Engineer, to produce sound, durable concrete foundation shafts
 free of defects. The permanent casing method shall be used only when
 required by the plans or authorized by the Engineer.
 If at any time during the construction of the drilled shafts the Engineer
 determines that the equipment, materials, employees, or procedures
 are such that defects in the work may occur, the Engineer may stop the
 work until appropriate changes are made by the contractor. In no case
 shall the contractor be relieved of its responsibility for constructing
 acceptable drilled shaft foundations.

 be uniformly distributed along the inside circumference of the
 reinforcing steel cage. The pipes shall be joined to provide a clean,
 watertight, and unobstructed opening from the top of the drilled shaft
 foundation to within one foot of the tip in accordance with the details
 shown on the plans. The PVC pipes shall be capped on the bottom and
 filled with water prior to concrete placement.
 The pipes shall be
 securely tied to the reinforcing steel in a straight line to prevent
 displacement during handling and concrete placement, and to permit
 the logging device to pass from top to bottom.
 The contractor shall provide the testing equipment, perform the
 inspection, and furnish test results to the Engineer. The contractor
 shall also provide documentation that the testing equipment has been
 calibrated and is functioning properly.
 Integrity testing shall be
 performed no sooner than 48 hours after placement of the concrete,
 and all testing shall be finalized within seven days of placement.

 thickness shall be uniform and consistent throughout the total length of
 the marking project.
 The contractor shall perform periodic spot checks of thermoplastic
 material to verify that the required thickness has been attained.
 Random spot checks of the thermoplastic thickness will be made by the
 Engineer to ensure conformance with the required criteria. Suggested
 spot check procedures include the following:
 W et:
 
 Thickness can be field tested immediately after the
 thermoplastic marking is applied by inserting a thin,
 graduated machinist rule or similar instrument into the
 molten thermoplastic to the depth of the pavement
 surface. The thickness is then determined visually by
 noting on the scale the depth of the penetration or
 coating of the instrument.
 
 Dried:
 
 Thickness can be field tested by placing a small flat
 sheet of metal with a known thickness immediately
 ahead of the striping apparatus. After striping, remove
 the sample and use a suitable measuring device, such
 as a caliper or micrometer, to determine the thickness
 of the dried marking.
 
 The finished thermoplastic line shall have well defined edges and be
 free from waviness. Lateral deviation of the thermoplastic line shall not
 e xc e e d o n e i n c h i n 1 0 0 .
 The longitudinal deviation of a painted
 segment and gap shall not vary more than six inches in a 40-foot cycle.
 The actual width of line shall be within the limits specified in the
 following table, according to the width of line called for on the plans:
 Plan Width
 4 inches
 8 inches
 Over 8 inches
 
 Ac t u a l W i d t h
 4 to 4-1/2 inches
 8 to 9 inches
 ± 1 inch
 
 After application and sufficient drying time, the thermoplastic marking
 shall show no appreciable deformation or discoloration under local
 traffic conditions with air and road temperatures ranging from -10 to
 180 degrees F.
 The drying time shall be defined as the minimum
 elapsed time, after application, when the thermoplastic pavement
 markings shall have and retain the characteristics required herein, and
 after which normal traffic will leave no impression or imprint on the
 newly applied marking. W hen applied within a temperature range of
 412.5 ± 12.5 degrees F and thickness range of 0.060 to 0.090 inches,
 the material shall set to bear traffic in not more than two minutes when
 t h e a i r a n d p a v e m e n t s u r f a c e t e m p e r a t u r e s a r e a p p r o xi m a t e l y 5 0 ±

 Method of Measurement:
 
 Thermoplastic pavement longitudinal and transverse markings, such as
 edge lines, lane lines, gore lines, cross-walks and stop bars, will be
 measured by the linear foot along the center line of the pavement
 marking line and will be based on a four-inch-wide line. Measurement
 for striping with a plan width greater or less than the basic four inches
 as shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer will be made by the
 same method and then adjusted by the following factor:
 Plan W idth of Striping (inches) x Linear Feet
 4 (inches)
 No measurement will be made of the number of linear feet of gaps in
 dashed lines.
 Double marking lines, consisting of two four-inch-wide stripes, will be
 measured as two individual marking lines. Crosswalk lines, stop bars,
 stop lines, gore lines, cross hatch lines, chevron lines and railroad
 marking transverse lines will be measured for centerline length and
 adjusted for widths other than four inches, as defined above.
 Thermoplastic pavement marking symbols, such as diamonds, or single,
 double, or triple arrows, will be measured by each unit applied. Each
 pavement symbol, as shown on the plans, will be considered a unit.
 Thermoplastic pavement marking legends, defined as a complete letter
 grouping such as "SCHOOL," "XING," "STOP," “RR,” or "ONLY.", will be
 measured by each unit applied. Each pavement legend, as shown on
 the plans, will be considered a unit.
 No separate measurement or payment will be made for cleaning and
 preparing the pavement surface, including abrasive sweeping and
 h i g h - p r e s s u r e a i r s p r a y , a n d f o r d i s p o s a l o f e xc e s s m a t e r i a l s , c l e a n i n g

 in the range from 68 to 95 inclusive. If not within the upper limit, run
 total solids on the sheared paint and adjust solids, if necessary, by
 adding water to reach the original solids content. If the solids content
 required adjustment, again check the viscosity of the paint.
 The
 viscosity must be in the range from 68 to 95 inclusive.
 (8) Scrub Resistance:
 Scrub Resistance will be determined according to ASTM D 2486. Use
 an appropriate doctor blade to provide a dry film thickness of three to
 four mils. Allow the paint to cure for 24 hours. Perform the scrub
 resistance test at 77 ± one degrees F and 50 ± five percent humidity.
 Record the number of cycles to remove the paint film. The number of
 cycles recorded must be a minimum of 800.
 ( 9 ) S p r a yi n g P r o p e r t i e s :
 The paint shall be applied at a 15 mils wet film thickness in the field.

 determined according to ASTM D 4414 and ASTM D 713 prior to test
 stripe application. To aid in obtaining the correct film thickness, a
 length of roofing paper placed by the side of the road can be used.
 Place a rigid metal test panel on the roofing paper in the path of a test
 line. Immediately after the test line is applied by the striper, measure
 the wet film thickness. If not satisfactory, adjust the spray pressure
 and repeat until the target wet film thickness is attained.
 It is
 important that no glass beads be present that would give a false wet
 film thickness. W hen the wet film thickness is correct, apply a test line
 across a tared metal test panel. After this, apply another test line
 across a different tared metal test panel, this time also adding the
 beads.
 These samples are necessary to determine the initial bead
 retention.
 Glass beads conforming to the requirements of Subsection 708-2.02 of
 these specifications (moisture proof type) will be applied after the paint
 has been applied, but during the same striping operation at a rate such
 that the initial bead retention on the test line is a minimum of six
 pounds of beads per gallon of wet paint. The initial bead retention will
 be determined analytically by the ADOT Materials Group concurrently
 with the determination of the dry paint thickness utilizing tared metal
 test panels. The paint shall accept the glass beads so that the spheres
 are embedded into the paint film to a depth of 50 percent of their
 diameter. Test stripes will be observed for a period of 180 days from
 date of application. Paints will be evaluated for wear according to
 ASTM D 913.
 After 180 days of service, on a visual rating scale of 0 to 100 percent,
 paints must have a rating of 92 percent or better to be acceptable. All
 ratings will be taken in the wheel track area. Glass beads shall show
 no more than a 30 percent loss after 180 days of test. This will be
 determined by taking close-up photographs of the paint film and by
 count determining the average bead loss.
 The road service test may be waived at the option of the Engineer or
 evaluated for a period of time less than 180 days.
 (12) Workmanship:
 Paint shall be free from foreign materials, such as dirt, sand, fibers
 from bags, or other material capable of clogging screens, valves,
 pumps, and other equipment used in a paint striping apparatus.
 The paint pigment shall be well ground and properly dispersed in the
 vehicle. The pigment shall not cake or thicken in the container, and
 shall not become granular or curdled. Any settlement of pigment in the
 640
 
 SECTION 708
 paint shall result in a thoroughly wetted, soft mass permitting the
 complete and easy vertical penetration of a paddle. Settled pigment
 shall be easily redispersed, with minimum resistance to the sidewise
 manual motion of a paddle across the bottom of the container, to form a
 smooth uniform product of the proper consistency. If the paint cannot
 b e e a s i l y r e d i s p e r s e d , d u e t o e xc e s s i v e p i g m e n t s e t t l e m e n t a s
 described above or due to any other cause, the paint shall be
 considered unfit for use.
 The paint shall retain all specified properties under normal storage
 conditions for 12 months after acceptance and delivery. The contractor
 shall be responsible for all costs and transportation charges incurred in

 (F)
 
 Ap p l i c a t i o n C a l i b r a t i o n R e q u i r e m e n t s :
 
 Prior to the start of all marking application operations, the film
 thickness, width and bead application rates shall be calibrated as
 specified below in the presence of the Engineer. If at any time a
 condition changes, or the required application rates are not being
 achieved, the contractor shall repeat the calibration process if so
 directed by the Engineer.
 (1) Film Thickness and Width Calibration for
 Longitudinal Lines:
 The required application speed for the pavement marking vehicle shall
 be determined prior to the start of each day’s marking operations.
 The equipment needed to calibrate paint wet film thickness and width
 are a stopwatch, metal sample plates 4 by 12 inches minimum, wet film
 thickness gauge, measuring tape, and a roll of tar paper. The paint
 film application thickness, width and speed shall be calibrated using
 the following procedure:
 Step 1 -
 
 A 30-foot length of four foot wide tar paper shall be rolled
 out and attached to the pavement in an area where the
 striping vehicle can achieve and maintain a speed of up to
 ten miles per hour without impacting traffic. The tar paper
 shall be secured to the pavement surface with duct tape so
 that it is laying flat. Three metal sample plates shall be
 placed three to four feet (apart and duct-taped down near
 the end of the 30-foot test distance.
 
 656
 
 SECTION 709
 Step 2 -
 
 The striping vehicle shall install a stripe, without glass
 beads, on the tar paper for the marked 30-foot distance and
 over the sample plates. The time that it takes the striping
 vehicle to apply the 30 feet (of test stripe shall be measured
 and then equated to a mile per hour application speed.
 Additionally, the velocity of the striping vehicle shall be
 noted by the driver. The contractor shall remove any test
 s t r i p e s w h i c h e xt e n d b e y o n d t h e t a r p a p e r .
 
 Step 3 -
 
 Immediately after the test stripe has been installed, the wet
 film thickness on all three metal plates shall be measured,
 as specified in ASTM D 1212, using a wet film thickness
 gauge. The device shall be inserted into the wet paint to
 the
 depth
 of
 the
 metal,
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 manufacturer’s recommendations, and the thickness visually
 noted. If a wet thickness gauge is used, the manufacturer's
 directions shall be followed. The stripe distribution on the
 sample plates will be inspected for width, edge definition,
 and overall visual appearance.
 
 Step 4 -
 
 Steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated until the optimum paint
 application speed, material flow settings, and sprayer
 heights are determined, and the atomizing pressures are
 established, such that an even clearly-defined stripe of the
 required width and thickness is produced.
 
 Additionally, spot checks of the applied wet film thickness shall be
 made by the contractor throughout the day. Random spot checks of the
 paint thickness will also be made by the Engineer to ensure
 conformance with the required criteria. The contractor shall inspect the
 wet film thickness immediately after the marking paint is applied by
 inserting a wet film thickness gauge, with graduations of 0.001 inch into
 the wet paint to the depth of the pavement surface, in accordance with
 ASTM D 1212. The thickness determined through spot checking shall
 be within 0.002 inches of the required thickness.
 If the applied thickness is not within the tolerance specified above, or
 the width of the line is less than required, all striping operations shall
 stop, and adjustments shall be made such that the required thickness
 or width is achieved.
 If after three consecutive adjustments the
 required width or thickness are still not being achieved, all striping
 operations shall be halted and the contractor shall repeat the
 calibration procedures herein specified before striping operations can
 start again.
 (2) Glass Bead Flow Calibration for Longitudinal Lines:
 The glass bead application rates shall be calibrated at the beginning of
 each day’s marking operation, after the marking paint application speed
 has been determined.
 
 657
 
 SECTION 709
 The equipment needed to calibrate the bead flow is a stopwatch, 1000milliliter beaker graduated at 50-milliliter intervals, a bead calibration
 chart (available from glass bead manufacturers), and two 5-gallon
 buckets. The bead calibration charts shall equate the volume of beads
 measured through the calibration process to the required glass bead
 application rate in pounds per gallon of dual component marking paint
 applied. The chart shall also include the required application speed in
 miles per hour to achieve the specified glass bead application rate.
 The glass bead application rate shall be calibrated using the following
 procedure:
 Step 1 -
 
 W ith the striping vehicle stopped and the paint sprayer off,
 place a bucket under the bead dispenser.
 
 Step 2 -
 
 Turn the bead dispenser on for five seconds.
 
 Step 3 -
 
 Pour the beads into the beaker and measure the volume.
 
 Step 4 -
 
 Using the bead calibration chart for the required thickness
 of paint, find the required bead application rate, the
 measured volume of beads in the beaker, and the resulting
 application speed.
 
 Step 5 -
 
 If the beaker volume is less than the chart value, increase
 the bead flow. If the beaker volume is more than the chart
 value, decrease the bead flow.
 
 Step 6 -
 
 Repeat Steps 2 through 5 until the required speed for the
 specified bead application rate matches the required paint
 application speed as determined in 709-3.02(F)(1).
 
 Once all application speed and settings have been calibrated, the
 contractor shall lay a test strip of the dual component paint marking at
 the specified width, thickness, and glass bead density. The test strip
 shall be placed on a 20-foot length of 4-foot wide tar paper, with two 4
 by 12-inch sample plates spaced ten feet apart. The contractor shall
 provide the two sample plates from the test strip to the Engineer. The
 plates shall indicate the date, project number, project name, thickness,
 bead application rate and contractor name on the back. The Engineer
 may have these plates tested per the requirements of Subsection 7092.02(J). All calibration activities shall be done in the presence of the
 Engineer.
 (3) Thickness and Glass Bead Calibration for Transverse
 M a r k i n g s , S ym b o l s a n d L e g e n d s :
 Calibration of thickness for transverse markings, symbols and legends
 prior to construction will not be required. The contractor shall inspect
 the wet film thickness immediately after the marking paint is applied by
 inserting a wet film thickness gauge, with graduations of 0.001 inch,
 into the wet paint to the depth of the pavement surface, in accordance
 with ASTM D 1212. The thickness determined through spot checking
 658
 
 SECTION 709
 shall be within 0.002 inches of the required thickness. Random spot
 checks of the marking thickness will also be made by the Engineer to
 ensure conformance with the required criteria.
 Bead application rates shall be determined by pre-weighing, in a clearly
 marked container, the amount of beads required for each transverse
 marking, symbol or legend. The contractor shall determine the amount
 of beads required for each individual application, and provide
 documentation to the Engineer for approval prior to application.
 (G)
 
 M a r k i n g Ap p l i c a t i o n :
 
 The standard application thickness and bead gradations types and rates
 for dual component markings shall be as follows:

 (4) Compression Wood:
 Abnormal wood that often forms on the lower side of branches and
 inclined trunks of coniferous trees. Characteristics include:
 (a) relatively wide annual ring, usually eccentric;
 (b) relatively high proportion of summerwood (frequently
 more than 50 percent of the width of the annual ring
 in which it occurs);

 due to internal strains resulting from unequal longitudinal shrinkage or
 t o e xt e r n a l f o r c e .
 (6) Dead Knot:
 A knot left by a branch that dies before the tree is cut. An encased
 knot is a dead knot in which the growth layers are not intergrown with
 those of the surrounding wood. Dead knots may contain soft fibers

 the cutting of the tree. A dead streak starts from the butt and differs
 from a wound, such as a catface or scar, where the growth of new wood
 shows that life processes are still acting to repair the injured part.
 ( 8 ) D e c a y:
 Decay or rot (advanced decay) is the disintegration of wood substance
 due to the action of wood destroying fungi.

 (15) Red Heart:
 A fungus caused by Fomes Pini occurs in the living tree, and is
 characterized in the early stages of infection by a reddish or brownish
 color in the heartwood. This is known as "firm red heart". Later, the
 wood, in the case of the living tree, disintegrates (decays) in small,
 usually distinct, areas that develop into white-line pockets.
 (16) Sap Satin:
 A discoloration of the sapwood caused by the action of certain molds
 and fungi that is not accompanied by softening or other disintegration
 of the wood. Refer to Subsection 731-2.03(D)(2)(a) for blue stain.

 Each MPS-P
 
 Pre-emptor Intervals:
 
 The pre-emptor shall control intervals by ring. Before the initiation of
 pre-emption, a delay input interval must be completed. If the delay is
 released before timing out, the pre-emptor will not initiate time.
 During pre-emptor timing any higher priority pre-emption input will
 override the active pre-emptor mode.
 2)
 
 Interval Programs:
 
 The following interval functions and
 programmed in the pre-emptor module.
 
 sequence
 
 per
 
 ring
 
 shall
 
 be
 
 Interval 1: The minimum guaranteed green interval.
 The effective start time for this interval is when the phase that is timing
 enters green. Therefore, if the phase was in green longer than the
 interval programmed time prior to initiation of pre-emption, the
 pre-emptor will advance to interval 3.
 Interval 2: The
 minimum
 interval.
 
 guaranteed
 
 green-pedestrian
 
 clearance
 
 The effective start time for this interval is when the phase that is timing
 enters pedestrian clearance. Therefore, if the phase was in pedestrian
 clearance longer then the interval programmed time prior to initiation of
 pre-emption, the pre-emptor will advance to interval 3.
 Interval 3: The minimum guaranteed phase yellow clearance interval.
 728
 
 SECTION 734
 The effective start time for this interval is when the phase that is timing
 enters yellow clearance.
 Therefore, if the phase was in yellow
 clearance longer than the interval programmed time prior to initiation of
 pre-emption, the pre-emptor will advance to interval 4.
 This interval will only be in effect if pre-emption was initiated during
 green or yellow. Pre-emption will terminate the green or yellow phase.
 Interval 4: The minimum guaranteed overlap yellow clearance interval.
 Any overlap is assigned to one ring that is timing during entry into
 pre-emption. The overlap will terminate when that ring starts interval.
 The effective start time for this interval is when overlaps go into yellow
 clearance. If the overlaps have been in yellow clearance longer than
 the interval programmed time prior to the initiation of pre-empt, the
 pre-emptor will advance to interval 5.
 Interval 5: The minimum guaranteed overlap all-red clearance interval.
 The effective start time for this interval is when the overlaps that are
 going to terminate and the phase that is timing are in red. This interval
 will stay in effect until all the overlaps that are going to terminate, and
 the phase that is timing has been in red for the programmed all-red
 time. The pre-emptor then will advance to interval 6.
 If there is no track clearance phase assigned to a ring, that ring will
 advance to interval 9.
 Interval 6: The track clearance green interval.
 This interval will time the assigned track clearance green programmed
 time, and upon completion, the ring will advance to interval 7.
 Interval 7: The track clearance yellow interval.
 This interval will time the assigned track clearance yellow programmed
 time. W hen the timing is complete, the ring will advance to interval 8.
 Interval 8: the track clearance all red interval.
 This interval will time the assigned track clearance all red programmed
 time. W hen the timing is complete, the ring will advance to interval 9.
 Interval 9: The hold/lock interval.
 W hen both rings of the pre-emptor sequence have reached interval 9,
 the pre-emptor will be advanced to interval A.
 Interval A: The duration passage interval.
 729
 
 SECTION 734
 This interval will time the completion of the programmed duration time.
 The duration time will start timing when the pre-emption sequence is
 started. Interval A will insure that the pre-emption sequence will not
 terminate until programmed time after initiation of pre-emption,
 regardless of the phases and intervals in effect during initiation of
 pre-emption or the timing of intervals preceding interval A.
 The phase assigned for each ring shall operate as a hold phase. The
 options of "ped indications active" and "hold flash" take effect during
 this interval.
 Interval B: The hold/passage interval.
 The hold time will start timing when pre-emption interval A starts.
 Interval B will insure a minimum time in the passage movement before
 pre-emption will be permitted to terminate. The interval will terminate
 only when the programmed time is complete and the pre-emption input
 is non-active, after which the interval will be set to C.
 The hold phases, "ped indications active" and "hold flash" shall be
 applied during interval B.
 Interval C: The hold/passage yellow clearance interval.
 At the completion of the hold/passage interval, the hold clearance
 yellow will time unless:

 o f e xp o s u r e . F o r e a c h m e a s u r e , a r a t i n g s c a l e o f f r o m o n e t o
 five points will be applied. A rating of one point indicates the
 poorest performance and five points indicate the best
 performance. The rating from each measure is multiplied by a
 weighting factor which represents the relative importance of
 that measure. The product is a score for that measure. The
 sum of the scores for all measures is the overall score for the
 system. All paint systems shall have an overall score of 100 or
 higher.

 Cracking/Flaking: Three ASTM standard test methods
 are used to provide a measure of the degree of
 degradation in this area: ASTM D 660, ASTM D 661,
 and ASTM D 772.
 The definitions and illustrations
 contained in these methods are used in combination for
 the rating scale. A weighting factor of three will be
 applied to the results of these tests.
 
 B)
 
 Blistering/Flaking:
 Two ASTM methods are combined
 for this rating scale: ASTM D 714 and ASTM D 772. A
 weighting factor of three will be applied to the results of
 these tests.
 
 C) Corrosion: A rating scale is derived from ASTM D 610
 for evaluating the degree of rusting. A weighting factor
 of three will be applied to the results of this test.
 D) Chalking/Erosion: Two ASTM methods are combined for
 this rating scale: ASTM D 4214 and ASTM D 662. A
 weighting factor of three will be applied to the results of
 these tests.

 when aggregates from the same source have been approved and the
 approved test results apply to the current production from that source.
 W hen aggregates show potential for alkali silica reaction (ASR), as

 The Engineer may require that aggregates be stored
 separately.
 Different sizes of aggregate shall be separated by
 bulkheads or stored in separate stockpiles sufficiently removed from
 e a c h o t h e r t o p r e v e n t t h e m a t e r i a l f r o m b e c o m i n g i n t e r m i xe d .
 W hen aggregates are stored on the ground, the sites for the stockpiles
 shall be clear of all vegetation and level. The bottom one-foot layer of
 aggregate shall not be disturbed or used.
 The handling and storage of concrete aggregate for Class P concrete at
 the job site shall be such as to minimize segregation. Stockpiles shall
 be neat and regular in form and shall occupy as small an area as
 possible.
 Stockpiles shall be constructed by first distributing the
 aggregate over the entire base and then building upward in successive

 layers not more than five feet in depth. Aggregate shall not be dumped
 or spilled over the side of the pile.
 W hen a conveyor is used to
 stockpile aggregate, it shall be equipped with an adequate rock tremie
 or rock ladder to reduce segregation and it shall be moved continuously
 across the stockpile. The distance the material drops from the tremie

 Aggregate shall be distributed over the
 stockpile so that the formation of conical piles higher than 10 feet is
 prevented.
 Contamination of concrete aggregate for Class P concrete by contact
 with the ground at the job site shall be positively prevented.
 The
 contractor shall take the necessary measures to prevent such
 contamination.
 Such preventive measures shall include, but not
 necessarily be limited to, placing aggregate on hardened surfaces
 consisting of Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, or cement
 treated material.
 The contractor shall maintain at least two full days worth of production
 of fine and coarse aggregate stockpiled at the batch plant for Class P
 concrete prior to starting and throughout the duration of Portland
 cement concrete paving operations. This requirement is waived for the
 last two days of production.

 A new mix design shall be submitted for approval any time the test
 results of an approved mix design indicate that the concrete does not
 meet the required compressive strength.
 W hen approved by the Engineer, concrete from trial batches may be
 used in the work at locations where concrete of a lower strength is
 required and such concrete will meet the requirements of the class of
 concrete at that location. The basis of payment for such concrete shall
 be that which applies to the concrete required at that location.

 Curing Cast-in-Place Concrete:
 
 ( A)
 
 General Requirements:
 
 All cast-in-place concrete shall be cured by one or by a combination of
 more than one of the methods specified herein and curing shall begin
 immediately after completion of machine or hand finishing of the fresh
 concrete.
 Curing shall be continued for a period of at least seven days after
 placing if either Type II Portland cement or Portland pozzolan cement
 has been used, or for at least three days if Type III Portland cement
 has been used.
 Surfaces requiring a Class II finish shall not be cured by the
 Liquid-Membrane Forming Compound Method until after the finishing
 operations are completed.
 No traffic, hauling, storing of material or other work shall be allowed on
 any concrete surface during the required curing periods.
 (B)
 
 Water Curing Method:
 
 All surfaces not covered by reasonably waterproof forms shall be kept
 damp by applying water with a nozzle that so atomizes the flow of the
 water that a fog mist and not a spray is formed until the surface of the
 concrete is covered with a curing medium or sprinkling of the surface is
 permitted. The moisture from the nozzle shall not be applied under
 pressure directly upon the concrete and shall not be allowed to
 accumulate on the concrete in a quantity sufficient to cause a flow or
 wash the surface.
 If a curing medium is used, the concrete shall be kept continuously wet
 by sprinkling with water for the entire curing period. Burlap, rugs,
 carpets, or earth or sand blankets may be used as a curing medium to
 retain the moisture during the curing period. Application of the curing
 medium shall not begin until such time that placement can be made
 without marring the surfaces of the concrete.
 If a curing medium is not used, the entire surface of the concrete shall
 be kept damp by the application of water with an atomizing nozzle as
 980
 
 SECTION 1006
 specified above until the concrete has set, after which the entire
 surface of the concrete shall be sprinkled continuously with water for
 the entire curing period.
 In no case shall curing be interrupted by more than one hour during the
 curing period.
 (C)
 
 Liquid-Membrane Forming Compound Method:
 
 All surfaces not covered by reasonably waterproof forms shall be cured
 by the liquid-membrane forming compound method.
 The curing
 compound shall be applied to the concrete immediately following the
 surface finishing operation in one or more applications totaling a rate of
 not less than one gallon per 100 square feet.
 The curing compound shall form a continuous unbroken surface.
 If the membrane film is broken during the curing period, the broken
 area shall be given a new application of compound at a rate sufficient
 to assure uniform coverage.
 In no case shall curing be interrupted by more than one hour during the
 curing period.
 (D)
 
 Forms in Place Method:
 
 Formed surfaces of concrete may be cured by retaining the forms in
 place. The forms shall remain in place for the entire curing period.
 All joints in the forms and the joints between the end of forms and
 concrete shall be kept moisture-tight during the curing period.
 Cracks in the forms and cracks between the forms and the concrete
 shall be resealed by methods approved by the Engineer.

 heating. This may be accomplished by the use of low-pressure steam
 or radiant heat with moisture.
 If curing of the concrete is accomplished by low-pressure steam or
 radiant heat with moisture, curing will be considered completed after
 termination of steam or radiant heat curing.
 Rapid temperature
 changes in the concrete shall be avoided during the cooling period.
 If curing of the concrete is accomplished by the water curing method,
 the liquid-membrane forming compound method, or the forms-in-place
 method, such curing shall be continued for a period of at least seven
 days after placement of the concrete. The curing time may be reduced
 to a minimum of three days when a Type III Portland cement has been
 used.
 (B)
 
 Low-Pressure Steam Curing:
 
 After placement of the concrete, precast items shall be held for a
 minimum two-hour presteaming period. If the ambient air temperature
 is below 50 degrees F, steam shall be applied during the presteaming
 period to hold the air surrounding the precast item at a temperature
 between 50 and 90 degrees F.

 Control cylinders shall be covered to
 prevent moisture loss and shall be placed in a location where
 temperature is representative of the average temperature of the
 enclosure.
 Temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous
 permanent record of the ambient curing temperature shall be provided.
 A minimum of two temperature recording devices or one for every
 200 feet of continuous bed length will be required for checking
 temperature.
 In the event the side forms are removed before the precast unit has
 attained the required release compressive strength, the curing method
 shall be continuous in maintaining the temperature and moisture level
 as described above, within the enclosure, as nearly as practical. There
 shall not be a delay in re-covering the girder or prestress member.
 (C)
 
 Radiant Heat With Moisture:
 
 Radiant heat shall be applied by means of pipes circulating steam, hot
 oil or hot water, or by heating elements or electric blankets on the
 forms. Pipes, blankets or elements shall not be in contact with the
 concrete surfaces.
 Moisture shall be applied in such a manner as to keep the top surface
 of the precast unit continuously moist during the curing period by
 fogging or spraying. Moisture shall be maintained by a cover of burlap
 or cotton matting and further covered by a waterproof tarpaulin with an
 insulating cover.
 Temperature limits and the use of recording thermometers shall be the
 same as curing with low-pressure steam. Application of the heat cycle
 may be accelerated to meet climatic conditions upon the approval of the
 Engineer.
 A temperature sensing device shall be placed two
 ± 1/2 inches from the heated form.

 additionally in the case of Class P concrete, on the measured thickness
 of concrete pavement in place according to Section 401. Sampling and
 testing for compressive strength will be performed on all classes of
 concrete furnished, including each strength specified on the project
 plans for Class S or Class E concrete.
 1006-7.02
 
 Sampling and Testing of Concrete:
 
 A sample of concrete for determination of temperature, slump, and air
 content (when required) as well as for fabrication of test cylinders for
 compressive strength determination at 28 days will be taken at random
 at the specified sampling frequency for each type of concrete.
 Samples of concrete shall be of sufficient size to perform all the
 required tests and fabricate the necessary test cylinders. The samples
 shall be taken in accordance with the requirements of AASHTO T 141,
 e xc e p t a s f o l l o w s :
 (1) Concrete for Class S, Class B, or Class E shall be sampled
 only once during discharge in the middle portion of the
 batch. At the discretion of the Engineer, a sample may be
 obtained at the beginning of the discharge if, in the
 Engineer's opinion, the properties of the concrete do not
 appear to be within the specification limits for slump or
 temperature.
 (2) Concrete for Class P shall be sampled immediately before
 going into the paver or forms, or as otherwise directed by
 the Engineer.
 If concrete is pumped to facilitate placement, at the discretion of the
 Engineer, samples may be taken from the truck and pump hose
 discharge to determine that the compressive strength specifications are
 met in the structure, and to correlate temperature, slump and air
 content results. If the correlation is satisfactory and meets with the
 approval of the Engineer, sampling may continue from the most
 convenient location with occasional re-testing for correlation.
 Rejection of concrete due to improper temperature or slump may occur
 at either the truck or pump hose discharge; however, rejection of
 concrete due to improper air content will only occur due to a failing test
 for a sample obtained at the final point of discharge.

 Testing for compressive strength of cylinders shall be in accordance
 with the requirements of Arizona Test Method 314.
 For Class S concrete with a compressive strength requirement less
 than 4000 psi, or Class B concrete, a strength test will consist of the
 average strength of two test cylinders. However, if the compressive
 strengths of the two test cylinders differ by more than 10 percent from
 the average of the two, the strength test result shall be the cylinder
 with the highest compressive strength.
 For Class S concrete with a compressive strength requirement equal to
 or greater than 4000 psi, or Class P concrete, the compressive strength
 of each sample shall be determined by averaging the results of the
 three test cylinders fabricated as specified in Subsection 1006-7.03.
 However, if the compressive strength of any one of the three test
 cylinders differs by more than 10 percent from the average of the three,
 its result shall be discarded and the compressive strength shall be the
 average of the remaining two cylinders.
 Should the individual
 compressive strength of any two of the three test cylinders differ by
 more than 10 percent from the average of the three, the results of both
 will be discarded and the compressive strength shall be the strength of
 the remaining cylinder.

 Sampling Frequency for Cast-In-place Concrete:
 Class S and Class B Concrete:
 
 For Class S concrete with a compressive strength requirement less
 than 4000 psi, or Class B concrete, a sample of concrete for the
 required tests, as specified in Subsection 1006-7.02, will be taken on a
 daily basis for each 100 cubic yards, or fraction thereof, of
 continuously placed concrete from each batch plant.
 For Class S
 concrete with a compressive strength requirement equal to or greater
 than 4000 psi, a sample of concrete for the required tests, as specified
 in Subsection 1006-7.02, will be taken on a daily basis for each 50
 cubic yards, or fraction thereof, of continuously placed concrete from
 each batch plant. For Class S or Class B concrete placed at elevations
 of 3,000 feet or above, air content testing shall be performed for each
 50 cubic yards placed, regardless of the compressive strength
 requirement. An additional sample or samples for any of the required
 tests may be taken at an interval of less than the sampling frequency
 specified above, at the discretion of the Engineer, on any batch or load
 of concrete. A sample for the required tests on daily placements of
 10 cubic yards or less may be taken at the discretion of the Engineer.
 (B)
 
 Class E Concrete:
 985
 
 SECTION 1006
 Class E concrete shall be sampled and tested for compressive strength
 by the sub-lot. A sub-lot will be 30 cubic yards or an accumulation of
 quantities of a specified strength of concrete to total 30 cubic yards. A
 sample will be obtained for each portion of concrete between 10 and 30
 cubic yards, inclusive, for each specified strength of concrete. For
 each specified concrete strength, the quantity of concrete represented
 by four samples will be defined as a lot. However, for a continuous
 pour of greater than 120 cubic yards of a specified strength of
 concrete, the total amount of concrete in that pour will be considered to
 be a lot, and four samples will be taken at randomly selected locations
 as directed by the Engineer.
 T h e E n g i n e e r m a y e xc l u d e c e r t a i n
 locations from random sampling should the Engineer determine that the
 location of the work precludes normal construction operations. Three
 test cylinders shall be fabricated from each sample and tested for 28day compressive strength in accordance with Subsection 1006-7.02.
 Class E concrete shall be sampled and tested for temperature and
 slump for each 30 cubic yards. For concrete placed at an elevation of
 3,000 feet or above, a sample will be taken for each 30 cubic yards for
 testing of air content. For quantities of concrete less than 30 cubic
 yards, the sampling and testing frequency for temperature, slump, and
 air content may be reduced with the concurrence of the Engineer.
 Additional samples for any of the required tests may be taken at the
 discretion of the Engineer.

 by the lot. A lot shall be considered to be one shift’s production;
 however, a new lot shall begin when the mix design is changed. For
 partial shifts due to weather or other reasons, more than one day’s
 production may be included in a lot. W hen such partial shifts occur,
 the contractor and the Engineer will jointly determine the lot limits.
 Five samples shall be obtained from each lot at random locations as
 d i r e c t e d b y t h e E n g i n e e r . T h e E n g i n e e r m a y e xc l u d e c e r t a i n l o c a t i o n s
 from random sampling should the Engineer determine that the location
 of the work precludes normal construction operations.
 Three test
 cylinders shall be fabricated from each sample and tested for 28-day
 compressive strength in accordance with Subsection 1006-7.02.
 Class P concrete shall be sampled and tested for temperature, slump,
 and air content (if applicable) a minimum of five times per lot. The
 frequency may be reduced for partial shifts with the concurrence of the
 Engineer. Additional samples for any of the required tests may be
 taken at the discretion of the Engineer.
 1006-7.04
 
 Sampling Frequency for Precast Concrete:
 
 A sample of concrete for the required tests as specified in
 Subsection 1006-7.02 will be taken for either each precast concrete
 986
 
 SECTION 1006
 member or for each day's production at the discretion of the Engineer,
 when the method of measurement is by the unit.
 An additional sample or samples for any of the required tests may be
 taken at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer will determine
 the quantity of concrete represented by each sample of concrete for
 any test performed.
 W hen a sample of concrete for the required compressive strength test
 is taken to represent a single day's production and not each precast
 member, the degree of acceptance for all precast concrete members in
 that day's production will be established by the results of such
 compressive strength test.
 1006-7.05
 
 Testing for Minor Precast Concrete Structures:
 
 A strength test on each precast unit produced will consist of the
 average rebound number as determined from readings taken on the
 precast unit with a rebound hammer. The average rebound number will
 be determined in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C 805.
 The compressive strength of the concrete will be determined from the
 average rebound number and the calibration chart established for the
 specific rebound hammer being used. The calibration chart will be
 established from rebound readings taken on concrete test cylinders
 fabricated at the precast plant and the actual compressive strength of
 the cylinders. The test cylinders will be fabricated in accordance with
 the requirements of AASHTO T 23. Testing for compressive strength of
 cylinders shall be in accordance with the requirements of Arizona Test
 Method 314.

 If, during production, it is determined by testing that asphalt-rubber
 fails to meet the above requirements for the specified type, the material
 in which the asphalt-rubber is incorporated and represented by the
 corresponding test results shall be evaluated for acceptance. Should
 the material in which the asphalt-rubber is incorporated be allowed to
 remain in place, the contract unit price for asphalt-rubber will be
 adjusted by the percentage shown in Table 1009-3.
 Should the
 asphalt-rubber be in reject status, the contractor may, within 15 days of
 receiving notice of the reject status of the asphalt-rubber, supply an

 which the asphalt-rubber is incorporated.
 The engineering analysis
 shall detail any proposed corrective action, and the anticipated effect
 of such corrective action on the performance. W ithin three working
 days, the Engineer will determine whether or not to accept the
 contractor’s proposal. If the proposal is rejected, the material in which
 the asphalt-rubber is incorporated shall be removed and replaced with
 material meeting the requirements of the applicable specifications at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 If the contractor’s proposal is
 accepted, the material in which the asphalt-rubber is incorporated shall
 remain in place at the applicable percent of contract unit price allowed,
 and any necessary corrective action shall be performed at no additional
 cost to the Department.
