Value Engineering VE applies to cost reduction proposals that are initiated developed and submitted in writing by the Contractor to the Department for modifying the plans the specifications or other contract requirements .
This applies only to a proposed change which is identified as a Value Engineering proposal at the time it is submitted to the Department .
VE proposals are those which would require a change in the contract and would result in a net savings over the contract cost without impairing essential functions and characteristics of the project including but not limited to service life reliability economy of operation ease of maintenance desired aesthetics and safety .
The intent of this provision is for the Department to share with the Contractor any cost savings generated on a project as a result of a proposal or proposals offered by the Contractor and approved by the Department .
The purpose is to encourage the use of the Contractors ingenuity and experience in arriving at alternate lower cost construction methods than those reflected in the contract documents by the sharing of savings resulting therefrom .
VE proposals based solely on deleted pay items will not be considered .
Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Department to consider or approve a VE proposal submitted hereunder however if a VE proposal is approved by the Department the net savings resulting from the proposal will be shared by the Department and Contractor on a basis .
b Submittal of Proposal .
As a minimum the following materials and information shall be submitted with each VE proposal plus any additional information requested by the Department .
A Statement that the proposal is being submitted as a Value Engineering proposal. .

Payments will be made on monthly estimates based on the estimated savings generated by the approved VE proposal .
The amount to be paid on these estimates will be a percentage of the total estimated savings in proportion to the amount of the VE proposal work performed during that month .
Upon completion of all work included in the VE proposal the final total savings will be determined by comparing the cost of the work based on the original contract quantities and the cost of the actual VE work performed .
The final payment for work performed under the VE proposal will make any necessary corrections in previous payments to reflect a total payment of of the generated savings to the Contractor . .
The Contractors costs for development design and implementation of the VE proposal are not eligible for reimbursement . .
The Contractor may submit VE proposals for an approved subcontractor but if the proposal is approved the reimbursement will be made by the Department to the Contractor. . Payment will be made under item number A Value Engineering Proposal No .

The sampling of Hot Mix Asphalt is outlined in ALDOT Forms and Examples for Sampling and Computing Pay Factors for Hot Mix Asphalt . .
Testing and Lot Verification .
Air voids shall be computed on the Contractors sample by using the running average of the Contractors last four maximum specific gravities .
If slag is used as an aggregate in the mixture the running average of the Contractors four most recent determinations for the bulk specific gravity of the compacted mixture shall be used in the computation of the air voids for the Contractors sample .
The calculation of the running averages of both maximum specific gravity and bulk specific gravity shall start with the first LOT .
The test strip is independent of the LOTs .
Air voids shall be computed on the Departments sample by using the Departments individual maximum specific gravity and bulk specific gravity .
The Department and the Contractor shall compare test results with each other for the above SECTION CONTROL OF MATERIALS mentioned testing increments .
If there are no differences or if the differences are within the tolerances listed in Tables V or VI Section for each parameter no further testing and analysis will be necessary and the Contractors test values will be used in the computation of the appropriate LOT pay factor .
If the Contractors air voids do not compare with the Departments test results the Contractor shall recompute test results using the individual maximum specific gravity for that particular testing increment and recompare with the verification test result .
If the results compare within the tolerances in Table V Section using the individual maximum specific gravities no further testing will be required and the Contractors running average of the last four maximum specific gravities will be used to compute air voids for pay factor determination .
Also if the Contractors air voids do not compare with the Departments test results and the Contractor is using slag as an aggregate the Contractor shall recompute test results using the individual bulk specific gravity for that particular testing increment and recompare with the verification test result .
If the results compare within the tolerances in Table V Section using the individual bulk specific gravity no further testing will be required and the Contractors running average of the last four bulk specific gravities will be used to compute air voids for pay factor determination .
If the results of the Departments verification test and the Contractors test do not compare within the tolerances in Tables V or VI Section but yield the same pay factor for the LOT when the Departments result is substituted for the Contractors result no further testing will be required .
Where the Contractors test results and the Departments test results do not compare and can not be resolved by the above mentioned methods but the pay factor dispute is between .
and .
the Contractor may elect to accept the .
pay factor and waive referee testing .
When differences between test results of the verification samples are not within the tolerances listed in Tables V or VI Section and can not be resolved by the above mentioned methods referee testing will be required .
All referee samples will be tested by the Bureau of Materials and Tests Central Laboratory Fairground Road Montgomery AL .

Under the provisions of Article .
the Engineer will determine the controlling item or items of work based on consideration of the Contractors approved Schedule of Operations and the operations that should be in progress at the time to provide for the orderly completion of the work within the contract time .
Consideration to not charging time will be given when delays of six hours or more occur when the causes for delays may be due to but not restricted to the following SECTION PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS .
Unavoidable causes beyond the control of the Contractor without fault or negligence on his part . .
Contractors proof in form of letters from suppliers of inability to obtain materials due to a regionwide shortage of such materials. . Failure on the part of a utility company to diligently perform work not under the control of the Contractor. . Acts of the Department. . Recovery Time . .
Strikes .
A working day will not be charged when the placement of hot mix asphalt is the controlling item of work and the start up operation is in an adjustment period unless the plant resumes production .
Upon receiving the monthly time statement the Contractor shall review the statement and compare the time charges with his records .
If the Contractor disagrees with the time charges on the statement he shall file a written protest setting forth the reasons why he considers the monthly time statement incorrect .
The Contractor is encouraged to file any such protest as soon as possible after receiving the time statement. . Contracts on a Calendar Day or Date Basis .
For projects on a calendar day or calendar date basis a similar statement will be furnished the Contractor indicating the number of calendar days remaining in the contract. . Extension of Contract Time .
a General .
An extension of contract time will be granted in the event the total cost of the completed work exceeds the total contract bid price .
For the purpose of this item the following costs will be excluded from the computation for total cost Supplemental agreements regardless of whether or not time extensions are allowed on the agreements Bituminous material price adjustments Adjustments due to the cost of construction fuel for HMA production Liquidated damages Incentive or disincentive payments Price adjustments for pavement smoothness Compensation for delay claims .
Overruns of pay items included in Sections and .
The extension of contract time shall be in the same ratio as the increase in the total cost .
If the Contractor finds it impossible for reasons beyond his control to complete the work within the contract time as specified or as extended in accordance with the provisions of this Article he may at any time prior to the expiration of the contract time as extended make a written request to the Engineer for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons which he believes will justify the granting of his request .
The Contractors plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time .
If the Engineer finds that the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor he may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify .
The extended time for completion shall then be in full force and effect the same as though it were the original time for completion .
If the Contractor disagrees with the decision of the Engineer he may appeal directly in writing to the Director .
The Director shall have final authority to approve or disapprove the request for an extension of time .
The Director may at his discretion refer the appeal to the Claims Committee for a recommendation before making his decision .
Reference is made to Section Claims .
Time extension requests will not be referred to the Claims Appeal Board .
b Contracts on a Working Day Basis .
When the time set for completion of the work is a number of working days extensions of contract time will be handled as outlined in Subarticle a above .
SECTION PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS c Contracts on a Calendar Day or Calendar Date Basis .
When the time set for completion of the work is a number of calendar days or a calendar date working days are not applicable .
Extension of time beyond the said calendar days or date will be made as follows When the notice to proceed is delayed more than calendar days after execution of the contract the date of completion will be extended the number of calendar days in excess of days between the date of execution of the contract and the date of actual issuance of the notice to proceed .
Where work is suspended by order of the Engineer due to no fault of the Contractor and time is not suspended a time extension will be granted for the number of calendar days the work is so suspended .
A time extension will be granted as provided in Subarticle .b .
A time extension will be granted as outlined in the first paragraph of Subarticle a above .
The following are valid reasons for time extensions when delays due to these causes are considered by the Department of Transportation to be beyond the control of the Contractor .
Utility Work being performed by others not under the Contractors control that prohibit the Contractors construction operations from proceeding with the normal working forces he would otherwise employ in performing the controlling item or items of work which normally would be in progress at the time said Utility work is being accomplished. . Recovery time as defined in Article .. .
If in the course of work material delivery time is in excess of that normally anticipated due to demands beyond the supplying industries capabilities provided such materials are necessary for the prosecution of the controlling items of work at that time and such can be substantiated by the Contractor in the form of letters from suppliers the Department will consider a time extension for the delay caused by the lack of available materials . .
If in the course of this project the Contractor feels he has been unjustly penalized because of delays in Departmental decisions he may submit for consideration by the Engineer written specific data covering the item or items and the time element involved .
The Department will consider only an extension for the actual work delay caused by the delay in obtaining a decision . .
If in the course of the work strikes occur while the Contractor is working in good faith and such was not caused by action of the Contractor the Department will consider a time extension for the delay caused by the strike .
When allowing a time extension under the provisions noted in this Subarticle consideration in determining the adjusted completion date for the work will be given to allow additional time to compensate for seasonal conditions weather and other factors not under control of the Contractor .
Should the Contractor after exercising a concerted effort to diligently prosecute the work taking full advantage of every available work day not be able to complete the work within the adjusted completion time because of nonavailability of days in which work can be performed the Department may consider an additional extension of time for the work. . Failure to Complete Work Within Contract Time .
Should the Contractor or in case of default the surety fail to complete the work within the time stipulated in the contract or the adjusted time as granted under the provisions of Article .
a deduction for each calendar day or work day that any work shall remain uncompleted an amount indicated by the Liquidated Damages Schedule shown in Article .
or provided in the contract documents shall be deducted from any monies due the Contractor on monthly estimates .

SECTION MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT A monthly HMA production fuel index will be established based on the average area terminal price reports for No .
fuel and No. . S fuel of the Platts Oilgram Price Report published during the week in which the first day of the month occurs .
Before the expiration of contract time plus approved time extensions the dollar amount of adjustment will be determined by multiplying the increase or decrease of the current current estimate month index from the base index by the number of gallons of fuel that are used in the production of the HMA during the period covered by the monthly estimate .
The number of gallons of fuel required for the production of the HMA shall be .
gallons per ton .
L per metric ton of HMA produced during the estimate period .
The base index will be the value of the index for the month in which the project is let .
After the expiration of contract time plus approved time extensions two calculations of a potential price adjustment will be made .
The first calculation will be made using the current index and the base index .
The second calculation will be made using the index during the month that contract time plus approved time extensions expired and the base index .
The amount of the price adjustment for the current estimate period will be the smallest amount of an increase in compensation if both calculations are an increase in compensation .
The amount of the price adjustment will be the largest amount of a decrease in compensation if both calculations are a decrease in compensation .
The amount of the price adjustment will be the decrease in compensation if one of the calculations is an increase in compensation and the other calculation is a decrease in compensation .
Changes in compensation will be made for the number of tons metric tons of HMA placed and paid for in accordance with the requirements given in the following Sections Section Plant Mix Bituminous Base Section PaverLaid Surface Treatment Section Polymer Modified Open Graded Friction Course Section Stone Matrix Asphalt Section Superpave Bituminous Concrete Base Binder and Wearing Surface Layers . .

The bidder must solicit this interest within sufficient time to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation .
The bidder must determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations .
b Selecting Portions of the Contract Work to Facilitate DBE Participation .
A good faith effort is selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the DBE goals will be achieved .

Evidence of such negotiation includes the names addresses and telephone numbers of DBEs that were considered a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for DBEs to perform the work .
A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors including DBE subcontractors and would take a firms price and capabilities as well as contract goals into consideration .
However the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidders failure to meet the contract DBE goal as long as such costs are reasonable .
Also the ability or desire of a bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make good faith efforts .
Bidders are not however required to accept higher quotes from DBEs if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable .
e Investigating the Capabilities of a DBE to Perform the Work .
A good faith effort is establishing sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of the capabilities of a DBE to perform the work for rejecting a DBE as being unqualified .
The bidders standing within its industry and membership in specific groups organizations or associations and political or social affiliations for example union vs. nonunion employee status are not legitimate causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids in the bidders efforts to meet the project goal .
f Providing Assistance in Obtaining Bonding Credit and Insurance .
A good faith effort is providing assistance to interested DBEs in obtaining bonding lines of credit or insurance as required by the DBE or bidder .
g Providing Assistance in Obtaining Equipment Supplies and Materials .
A good faith effort is providing assistance to interested DBEs in obtaining necessary equipment supplies materials or related assistance or services .
h Utilizing Industry Governmental and Service Groups .

When the initial days operation is less than square yards m this initial section will be carried over to subsequent days operations to make a unit of approximately square yards m. In any unit checked the average rate shall not vary from the specified rate by more than pounds per square yard kgm for layers of pounds per square yard kgm or less and pounds per square yard kgm for layers greater than pounds per square yard kgm .
On the first applied layer of resurfacing where there is no required milling or leveling this tolerance is increased to pounds per square yard kgm for layers of pounds per square yard kgm or less and pounds per square yard kgm for layers greater than pounds per square yard kgm .
This tolerance is for providing leeway in equipment adjustment only .
A consistent and uncorrected variation from the specified rate even within this tolerance will not be allowed without the Engineers written approval .
This tolerance does not apply to patching leveling and widening .
If the average rate of any unit is found deficient by more than the above referenced tolerance the Engineer will determine whether the Contractor shall remove and replace the deficient unit without payment for the removal or the material removed or whether the Contractor may leave the deficient unit in place and cover it with a layer of the same mix of adjusted maximum size aggregate of not less than pounds per square yard kgm average .
In case the surface layer shall not be featheredged at the end of the overlay layer but a sufficient amount of the surface beyond the ends of the deficient unit shall be removed to a neat line across the pavement to allow placing the full pounds per square yard kgm and to make a joint that will meet the surface requirements .
There will be SECTION ASPHALT PAVEMENTS no payment for any portion of the overlay needed to bring the total up to the designated average rate for that unit .
If the average rate of any unit is found to exceed the above referenced tolerance the tonnage metric tonnage in the unit that is in excess of the specified rate will be paid for as specified in Subarticle .a .

Test Pile with Static Load Testing .
Test piles shall be driven to the minimum tip elevation when provided .
Test piles shall be driven to a hammer blow count given on the blow countbearing capacity graph .
This graph shall be used as an estimate of the test piles bearing capacity which uses the required minimum bearing capacity equal to twice the design load and stroke to obtain the required blow count for the test pile .
Once the required blow count and minimum tip elevation when provided is reached the bearing capacity shall be proven after a day wait for concrete piles and a hour wait for steel piles with a Static Load Test .
This blow count and stroke or the equivalent blow count and stroke recorded during the last foot mm of driving of a passing Static Load Test Pile shall be used as the acceptance criteria for the production piling represented by this test pile .
A revised bearing graph will be provided by the Materials Tests Engineer that reflects the actual capacity of the test pile which shall be used to determine the bearing capacity of all production piles represented by this test pile .

g Loading Methods .
Static Load Testing Method a .
Description .
Static load testing shall be used to verify the axial load bearing capacity of pile groups or individual piles .
Static load testing should be used after a test pile has been driven to the minimum tip elevation if shown on the plans and has met the bearing capacity estimate based on blow count and hammer stroke from the provided bearing curves .
A static load test may also be used in conjunction with a dynamic load test when verifying axial load bearing capacity of piling .
b .
General .
When required the length of piles to be driven shall be determined by the actual loading tests of any designated pile Test or Production in the structure .
The test shall be performed as defined by ASTM D Standard Test Method for Piles Under Static Axial Compressive Load using the Quick Load Test Method .
In general these tests shall consist of the incremental application and removal of static pressure exerted on the pile through approved rigging together with suitable apparatus for accurately determining the superimposed weight mass of pressure and pile settlement under each increment of load .
The safe allowable load shall be determined by the Engineer from the settlement SECTION PILING versus load curve generated by the incremental loading based on Davissons failure criterion explained in Subitem .g.c .
A minimum day waiting period shall be observed between the driving of a concrete load test pile and the commencement of the load testing unless otherwise specified in the contract or authorized by the Materials and Tests Engineer .
For piles other than concrete this waiting period shall be hours .
The Contractor may extend the waiting period as deemed necessary before performing a static load test to allow for maximum soil set up time .
If the Quick Load Test is performed using adjacent production piles as reaction piles for the test pile the involved production piles should be checked for any permanent upward displacement .
If any upward displacement is found then all production piles used as reaction piles for the Quick Load Test shall be redriven as necessary to correct any possible axial load bearing capacity problem with the involved piles .
This redrive shall be performed at the Contractors expense .
c. Static Load Test Procedure .
The apparatus for applying the load shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer and have a capacity of tons kN or percent of the design load whichever is less .
Incremental loads of of the design load shall be placed on the pile at .
minute intervals until continuous jacking is required to maintain the incremental load or the capacity of the load frame is reached .
All loading tests will be continually inspected by the Engineer .
Time load and settlement data will be recorded on Form CB immediately before and after the application of each load increment and at intermediate time intervals as specified .
When the maximum load has been applied readings will be taken and recorded when jacking has stopped .
Additional readings will be taken after .
minutes and again at minutes .
If a longer holding period is specified additional readings will be taken as required .
The load shall be removed after the required holding period in equal parts with time and rebound readings taken at each unloading increment .
Readings will be taken immediately following each load removal allowing .
minutes between increments .
Upon removal of the entire load time and rebound readings will be taken and recorded .
Additional time and rebound readings will be taken after .
minutes and again at minutes .
Load test data will be plotted by the Engineer in the form of settlement in inches millimeters ordinate positive down versus applied load in kips kN abscissa .
Ultimate capacity predictions will be based upon Davissons failure criterion as applied to the aforementioned settlement curve as per FHWAs Manual on Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations .
In this method the elastic shortening of the pile QLAE in inches millimeters is superimposed on the settlement curve .
In the elastic shortening equation Q represents load in kips kN L represents length of pile from settlement instrumentation to tip elevation in inches meters A represents cross sectional area in square inches square meters at voided section if a void is present and E represents elastic modulus in ksi MPa elastic modulus for concrete piles is preferably obtained from dynamic load testing but may be calculated as times the square root of the design compressive strength in psi MPa when dynamic load testing is not performed .
The elastic modulus for steel piles may always be assumed as ksi MPa .
The aforementioned elastic shortening curve is then increased or offset by .D in inches .D in millimeters where D pile diameter or width in inches mm .
The point in which the offset elastic shortening curve intersects the settlement curve is considered the ultimate pile capacity .
d. Hydraulic Jacks and Load Gages .
When hydraulic jacks and gages are to be used for the superimposed load the jacks gages and hydraulic pumps shall have been calibrated with each other within the last months by an independent laboratory that has been approved by the Materials and Tests Engineer or by a Department laboratory .
If multiple jacks are to be used with one gage the calibration shall be performed at an approved independent laboratory .

All calibration checks shall be within of the applied load .
When a jack gage and hydraulic pump are calibrated they shall be used as a unit and changing any one of the three components shall require a recalibration .
Gages shall be of the size that will provide ease of reading approximately .
inch mm diameter with gradations for tons kN or less for loads under tons kN and gradations of tons kN or less for loads over tons kN .
Calibrated jacks gages and pumps shall have identifiable serial numbers to insure traceability to calibration tests . .
