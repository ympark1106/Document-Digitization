This change is in response to the Federal Government mandate that all highway construction contracts receiving Federalaid funding and advertized after September have Plans Specifications and Estimates PSEs prepared exclusively in metric units .
Therefore any project designed by any state agencyauthority andor which involves Federal andor Massachusetts Highway Department MHD funding and scheduled for advertising after September must be prepared in metric units .
Legal Basis for Highway Conversion The use of the metric system has been established over the past two decades by the Federal Government in a series of acts regulations and orders the most important of which are summarized below .
The intent of these initiatives is to have the United States adopt a measurement system that is simpler to use uses only one unit for measuring each physical quantity and provides industry the opportunity to rethink their designs and to incorporate efficient practices .
It also brings the United States into line with the rest of the world which now is virtually all metric .
Metric Conversion Act of The Act U.S.C .
declared a national policy of coordinating and encouraging the increased use of the metric system .
The Act required that the conversion be led by industry and the key word was voluntary .
Although conversion activities were somewhat increased there was no widespread support from industry for complete metrication .
The American Association of State Highway Officials AASHTO decided at that time to defer further activity on conversion until national legislation was adopted .
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of Section b of the Trade and Competitiveness Act Public Law amended the Metric Conversion Act of to declare that the metric system is the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce .
Further it requires each Federal agency to convert to the metric system to the extent feasible by September for all procurements grants and businessrelated activities .
The obvious intent of this Act was to use the substantial buying power of the Federal government to lead the country to the metric system .
U.S .
DOT Metric Conversion Planning Guidelines On May the U.S. Department of Transportation U.S .
DOT issued order .C which established policy and administrative procedures for the transition .
The U.S .
DOT Order requires agencies to develop plans for metric conversion to the extent practical including specific dates for changeover to metric in all procurements grants and other businessrelated activities .
In response to this Order the Federal Highway Administration FHWA developed an approved conversion plan and a timetable which is intended to lead to complete metric implementation by September .
Executive Order On July President Bush issued Executive Order Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs .
The intent of this Order is clear .
Federal Agencies are to convert to metric and they are to do so within a fixed period of time .
The Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges ii The Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges has undergone an extensive review during its preparation and conversion to the metric system .
Users of this document should note the following .
Metric measurements noted herein have been developed based on information available at the time this document was published and generally accepted metric conversion practices .
Some measurements have been soft converted while other measurements have been hard converted .
In soft conversion an inchpound measurement is mathematically converted to its exact or nearly exact metric equivalent .
With hard conversion a new rounded rationalized metric number is created that is convenient to work with and remember. . As the transition to the metric system continues in the United States it is inevitable that changes to some metric measurements noted herein will be modified particularly as more products become hard converted . .
In addition to the exclusive use of metric units in the Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges there have also been changes to various sections and new sections added that are not in the edition of this document .
It is therefore necessary to use only the appropriate document for a particular project .

DESCRIPTION .
General .
Construction of all embankment fill shall be done in accordance with the relevant provisions of Sections and and in accordance with the procedures described herein .
This work comprises the formation of embankments with suitable material obtained from excavation and borrow thoroughly compacted to produce a stabilized embankment .
The work shall be performed in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the plans as directed .
Material available from widened cuts outside the slopes as indicated on the plans or as ordered by the Engineer may be used in embankments or elsewhere upon written request by the Contractor and subsequent written approval by the Engineer .
The Engineer shall determine the suitability of any excavation material for incorporation in the embankment .
If the Contractor desires to waste excavated material and provide borrow to replace it for hisher own convenience heshe may do so only after obtaining the written approval of the Engineer and after satisfactory arrangements have been made for the measurements and disposal of the material .
When it is determined by the Engineer that there is not sufficient material available either from excavation within the RightofWay or the slope lines of the section under Contract for the formation of embankments roadbeds in cut sections foundations shoulders or backfill the Contractor shall obtain such additional material as may be necessary from outside the location and this material will be borrow material . .
Borrow Pit Restrictions .
With the exception of commercial borrow pits the location material removal operation and final shaping and finishing of borrow pits regardless of location must conform with all local and State regulations and for the purpose of preventing water pollution shall be subject to approval by the Engineer prior to use during the material removal operation and upon completion .
Borrow pits shall be so graded and finished after material removal is completed that there can be no reasonable possibility of a safety hazard nor ponding of water nor water pollution caused by later erosion of the pit .
Borrow pits located adjacent to the RightofWay shall be finished by extending the slope of the cross section to a berm to be constructed or left within the RightofWay at the side line .
The berm shall be a minimum of .
meters high and millimeters wide across the top with natural slopes in both directions or as otherwise directed .
The floor of the pit shall slope away from the location line at a minimum rate of for at least meters .

Particular attention shall be given to make the slopes harmonize with the general appearance of the adjacent landscape provided however that no slope shall be steep enough to constitute a public menace .
No unsightly accumulation of material shall be permitted which may in any manner deface the finished landscape .
The cost for the final shaping and finishing of borrow pits shall be included in the contract unit price of the type of borrow furnished with no additional compensation .
MATERIALS .
General .
All embankment materials whether coming from excavation or borrow shall consist of solid sound mineral aggregate .
It shall be free from deleterious organic elastic or foreign matter and shall be adequately graded for satisfactory compaction into a stabilized soil structure .
These materials will be classified into particular groups according to AASHTO M The Classification of Soils and Soil Aggregate Mixtures for Highway Construction Purposes .
All borrow material to be furnished shall meet the requirements specified in the following Subsections of Division III Materials Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges II .

CONSTRUCTION METHODS .
General .
Prior to starting work the Contractor shall obtain approval for the compaction equipment to be used .
Unless otherwise required in the Special Provisions each layer of embankment material shall be thoroughly compacted with power rollers or tamping rollers .
Other equipment or equivalent compactive capacity may be used subject to trial on the project and approval by the Engineer .
Compacting equipment will not be used for any other purpose during compaction operations .
The use of tractors trucks scrapers or other equipment designed primarily for purposes other than compaction and being used for purposes other than solely compaction will not be considered as compaction equipment but traffic of such vehicles shall be distributed over this fill in such a manner as to take advantage of the additional compaction afforded thereby .
Sufficient leveling and compacting equipment shall be provided to do the work of spreading and compacting the material promptly after it has been deposited .
When in the Engineers judgment such equipment is inadequate to spread and compact the material properly the Contractor shall reduce the rate of excavation and placing of the fill to a rate not to exceed the capacity of the leveling and compacting equipment or employ additional equipment .
The Contractor shall plan hisher grading operation to use all rock possible from all excavation either as backfill in excavated muck areas or in areas of greatest depth .
Before placing of any fill the areas under embankments shall be cleared grubbed and stripped as specified in Section and .
Frozen material shall not be placed on embankments nor shall embankments be placed on material frozen to a depth of over millimeters .
If during the construction of an embankment the top layer becomes frozen to a depth of over millimeters the frozen material shall be removed before a succeeding layer is placed on the embankment .
This work shall be performed at no additional expense to the Department .
Frozen excavated material if suitable when dry shall be allowed to thaw and dry and then be placed in the embankment .
No compensation will be allowed for the storing and rehandling of these materials .
Embankments shall be formed by placing successive layers of material uniformly distributed and compacted over the full width of the cross section unless otherwise directed .
Stumps rubbish sod frozen or other unsuitable materials shall not be incorporated in the embankment .
The Contractor shall prosecute hisher work so that no damage will occur to drainage pipe lines or masonry or brick structures See Subsection .. .
Preparation of Foundation Areas .
The foundation areas shall be cleared grubbed and stripped as required and all soft spongy or other material unsuitable for embankment foundation shall be removed .
When in the Engineers judgment there is reasonable doubt as Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges II .
to the suitability of the existing material for embankment foundation no further work shall be performed in the area in question until the material is tested and approved for use or remedial methods are ordered by the Engineer .
Embankment areas meter or less in height from the subgrade to the existing ground shall be rough graded and compacted to not less than percent of the maximum dry density of the material as determined by the AASHTO Standard Method of Test T Method C at optimum moisture content as determined by the Engineer without additional compensation before placing any fill .
If the material retained on the .
millimeter sieve is or more of the total sample this test shall not apply and the material shall be compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer .
For embankments greater in height than meter below the proposed subgrade to existing ground no additional embankment foundation area preparation will be required provided the material within the area is suitable for the purpose .
Regardless of the height of fill where embankment is to be placed against existing earth slopes steeper than vertical to horizontal the slope shall be broken up into steps of random width as the fill is placed in order to provide a suitable bond between the existing ground and the new embankment .
Both the material cut out and the bottom of the area cut into shall be compacted along with and to the same degree as the material being placed in the embankment without additional compensation for excavation benching or compacting .
Where foundations for bridges culverts span .
meters or more and major wall structures are to be founded on the embankment the embankment to the extent shown on the plans shall be constructed of Gravel Borrow for Bridge Foundations andor Crushed Stone for Bridge Foundations .
At the sites of footings for abutments piers or other structures having pile foundations the material shall be placed in embankment prior to driving piles and shall be of a quality and grading that will not obstruct driving of the piles .
Where foundations for structures are to be supported on newly formed embankments and where flying wingwalls are to be constructed the embankment shall be placed to an elevation of at least millimeters above the bottom of the proposed foundation or flying wingwalls and thoroughly and satisfactorily compacted .
After the above work is completed the material within the area of the proposed foundation or flying wingwalls will be excavated to the grade of the bottom of the concrete .
Excavation of this compacted fill will be paid for under the item of Bridge Excavation as stipulated in Subsection .. . Embankment Construction With Materials Other Than Rock .

Earth embankment shall be placed and compacted in uniform layers not exceeding millimeters in depth loose measurement each layer of material shall be spread on the entire width of the embankment and leveled off by approved equipment .
The embankment materials shall be compacted to not less than percent of the maximum dry density of the embankment material as determined by AASHTO Standard Method of Test T Method C at optimum moisture content .
If the material retained on the .
millimeter sieve is percent or more of the total sample this test shall not apply and the material shall be compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer .
The Contractor shall without additional compensation employ whatever measures that may be necessary to adjust the natural water content of the suitable embankment material to permit the placement and compaction as hereinbefore specified .
The Engineer during the progress of the work may make tests as required determining the inplace density of the soil by one of the following Standard Methods of Test Density of Soil and Soil Aggregate InPlace by Nuclear Methods Shallow Depth AASHTO T Density of Soil InPlace by the SandCone Method AASHTO T or Density of Soil InPlace by the Rubber Balloon Method T . Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges II .

No stones larger than millimeters shall be used to fill where piles are to be driven .
Embankment constructed in basement areas of demolished buildings and other areas restricting the use of power rollers etc .
shall be compacted by mechanical tamping with approved power tools .
If the naturalinplace moisture of the excavated material makes it impractical to compact the soil the Contractor shall dry the soil by disking harrowing blading rotary mixing or by other approved means or compaction of the layer of wet material may be deferred until the layer has dried so that it can be properly compacted .
If these above methods do no produce the desired results or when in the judgment of the Engineer excess moisture resulting from climactic conditions beyond the control of the Contractor is considered to have affected adversely the stability of the previously placed and satisfactorily compacted embankment materials the Engineer may direct the placement of single layers of Special Borrow to act as stabilizing drainage layers .
When so ordered by the Engineer the Contractor shall place a layer of Special Borrow having a depth of not more than millimeters in thickness loose measure .
Such materials shall be placed completely over the entire width between the limits designated by the Engineer and shall be compacted as hereinafter specified before the succeeding layer of suitable embankment materials from the roadway excavation is placed .
The work may be ordered suspended if the weather and climactic conditions are such that the embankment and excavation can not be performed in accordance with the specifications .
No additional compensation will be allowed to the Contractor for such suspension of work .
If the work is ordered suspended due to weather or other climactic conditions not under the control of the Contractor an extension of time may be granted to the Contractor by the Engineer. . Rock in Embankment .

DRILLING METHODS .
General .
A .
Starting Boring Every boring shall start as a Drive Sample Boring except Hollow Stem Auger Auger Undisturbed Sample Preparatory and Vane Shear Test Preparatory Borings .
Where the resistance to penetration with earth boring tools as defined herein by Practical Refusal Section F. is encountered above the specified highest bottom elevation the borehole nevertheless shall be made to said elevation .
Should bedrock be encountered above the specified highest bottom elevation the borehole shall be continued as a rock core boring for meters unless otherwise directed .
B. Casing Casing shall be of a size that will permit the specified soil sample or rock core to be obtained or groundwater observation well to be installed or to allow for telescoping and spinning of casing .
All pieces of casing and washpipe shall be equal in length .
Casing may be driven into the ground only so far as is necessary to keep the wall of the borehole in place and then open hole techniques may be employed .
However if the Contractor so elects casing may be used throughout the borehole as required .
Casing for rock core borings shall be sealed on bedrock to prevent loose material from entering the hole and to prevent the loss of drilling fluid return regardless of the type or types of material Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges II .
encountered .
Except for the first piece when starting each borehole the bottom of the casing should not be advanced below the bottom of the borehole that has been made with a chopping or drilling bit without the approval of the Engineer .
C. Making the Borehole Independent of whether casing or open hole techniques are employed the borehole shall be started and made by loosening the soil with a bit attached to the lower end of a hollow rod and given a chopping motion with a clockwise twist at the bottom of each stroke .
An auger either hand or power driven a welldrill or a rotary drill shall not be used for advancing the borehole in less than Dense or Very Dense or Practical Refusal soil .
However when casing is used a rotary bit may be used to clean the casing .
A sampler shall not be used instead of a chopping or drilling bit for making a borehole .
To make a borehole through Dense Very Dense or Practical Refusal soil boulders rockfill or other similar material the Contractor may employ whatever method heshe chooses including roller bits telescoping and spinning of a casing without endangering life and property or affecting the purpose for which the boring is being made .
The Contractor shall not use a backhoe or other earth moving equipment without the express approval of the Engineer to start a boring .
The soil thus loosened shall be borne to the surface in a liquid which is forced down through the hollow rod out through the discharge ports in the bit and up the annular space between the hollow rod and the wall of the borehole andor casing .
Except when preparing the borehole for special sampling the discharge ports shall direct the flow downward .
The returning liquid shall be discharged into a settling basin and shall be reused recirculated to form a native mud .
Water alone for transporting the loosened soil shall not be used except at the very beginning of each borehole .
If a contractor elects to use open hole techniques an effective mud for the purpose of transporting out the loosened soil and for stabilizing the wall and bottom of the borehole may be manufactured by adding a fat clay or bentonite or one of its derivatives in sufficient amount to the native mud .
When making boreholes in very porous material the Contractor may with the prior consent of the Engineer drive casing to seal the wall of the borehole .
The volume of mud to be calculated at any time shall be no more than is necessary to transport the loosened soil but in no event more than liters per minute when making the borehole in .
millimeter casing .
No rig shall be removed from its position above the borehole nor shall the casing be pulled from the hole until the inspector has been shown a copy of the field log for that hole and has approved the removal of the rig andor of the casing .
D. Changes in Soil At each change in soil as detected by the driller with intervals not to exceed those as stated under Item .
the drilling operation shall cease and the borehole conditioned for sampling by slowing the pump raising the bit off the bottom and circulating the liquid to remove from suspension large particles which might become settled solids and thus a part of the sample .
The bit on the bottom end of the hollow rod shall then be replaced with a . millimeter inside diameter splittube sampler which shall be entered into the undisturbed soil at the bottom of the borehole for the sample .
E. Obstructions Should an obstruction be encountered in a drive sample boring the Engineer may require the Contractor to make additional borings at locations to be determined by the Engineer to attempt to pass the obstruction and complete the boring .
Practical Refusal boulders hard material or rock fill will not be considered an obstruction .
Final determination when and if an obstruction is encountered shall be made by the Engineer .
Borings terminating on obstructions shall be considered trial borings and paid as a drive sample boring .

A traffic lane is defined as being between longitudinal joints or between a longitudinal joint and a pavement edge .
The last unit in each lane shall be meters plus the fractional part of meters remaining .
One core will be taken at random in each unit by the Contractor .
When the measurement of the core from a unit is not deficient by more than millimeters from the plan thickness the pavement in the unit represented will be paid for at full unit price .
When such measurement is deficient by more than millimeters but less than millimeters two additional cores at intervals of not less than meters will be taken .
The thickness of the unit will be considered to be the average of the three cores provided none is deficient by millimeters or more .
Payment for the pavement in the unit will be at an adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection ..
In calculating the average thickness of the pavement measurements in excess of the specified thickness will be considered as the specified thickness .
Measurements which are less than the specified thickness by millimeters or more will not be included in the average .
When any core is deficient by millimeters or more additional cores will be taken at .
meter intervals in each direction until a core is found in each direction that is deficient by less than millimeters .
Each such exploratory core will represent the depth of .
meters of pavement one traffic lane in width .
The pavement so represented will be deducted from the unit of pavement being measured and the remaining area cored and measured as described previously .
Pavement deficient by millimeters or more but less than millimeters may be accepted by the Engineer at no payment to the Contractor .
However the Contractor may at hisher own expense remove and replace the pavement which will then be cored and measured for payment as herein provided .
Pavement deficient by millimeters or more shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at hisher own expense .
Payment for such replaced pavement will be as provided herein .
Other areas such as intersections entrances crossovers ramps etc .
will be considered as one unit and the thickness of each unit will be determined separately .
Small irregular unit areas may be included as part of another unit .
At such points as the Engineer may select in each unit one core will be taken for each square meters of pavement or fraction thereof in the unit .
Thickness of each unit will be determined as described previously except that when additional cores in any unit are required they will be taken at locations as directed by the Engineer .

III .
Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges M .. Draped Pretensioned Strands .
Draped pretensioned strands may be tensioned partially by jacking at the end of the bed and partially by uplifting or depressing strands or they may be tensioned entirely by jacking with the strands being held in their draped positions by means of rollers or pins or other approved methods during the jacking operation .
Whatever means is used low friction devices must be used at all points of change in slope of strand trajectory at the time of tensioning .
The tension for draped strands applied by jacking is done in essentially the same manner and must conform to the same requirements as the tensioning for straight strand unless otherwise noted .
If draped strands are tensioned in their draped position they should be supported by lubricated rollers with bronze bushings or roller bearings at all holdup points and low friction free turning rollers at all holddown points .
A recommended procedure for tensioning draped strands in the deflected trajectory by single strand jacking is as follows .
Applying initial tensioning load to strand. . Mark the strand for elongation measurement . .
Apply the full tension load as determined by the jack gauge not by elongation. . Measure elongation and determine the remaining elongation required for full tension based on computed elongation. . Jack the strand from the other end to remaining required elongation and note the load measured by the jack gauge .
The actual gauge reading will probably be in excess of the theoretical gauge reading but should not exceed it by more than .
Single strand tensioning of strands in the draped position by jacking the strands from only one end is permissible provided the required strand elongation is obtained without the jack gauge pressures exceeding the theoretical by more than .
When strands are deflected after partial tensioning the strands must be raised or depressed exactly the correct distances and they should be deflected simultaneously at all points or in an approved specific sequence .
Disregard of these requirements could result in incorrect strand tension and put stress distribution along the strand .
The lengths of the strands to be used in calculating elongations should be the actual length of the strand along its trajectory between the fixed anchorage and the reference point at the jacking end of the strand .
It is imperative that the actual dimensions of the bed layout and locations of holdup and holddown points agree with the dimensions shown on the approved working drawings .
Uplift and holddown devices must be attached in such a manner as to maintain the specified centerto center spacing of strands in both the vertical and the horizontal directions .
Provisions should be made for a minimum of millimeters of concrete cover on all metal parts of the hold down devices remaining within the beams .
Use of approved fiber sleeves for the holddown bolts is satisfactory .

Sleeves and galvanized steel or cast inserts shall be placed in the beams as shown on the plans .
They shall be carefully located and securely fastened to the forms to prevent displacement .
Sleeves or inserts not properly placed may be cause for rejection of the beams .
Curing .
The beams shall be cured at a minimum temperature of C and minimum humidity of for the minimum curing period necessary to produce the minimum cylinder strength as specified on the plans transferring prestress .
A longer period of curing shall be required if curing test specimens fail to meet the minimum compressive strength .

Failure of any test specimen to meet of minimum strength or failure of average to meet the full minimum strength requirement shall be cause for rejection of all beams poured that day .
M ..
Transferring Tension to Concrete .
In pretensioning after the concrete has developed the required strength the tension in the strands shall be transferred to the concrete gradually .
This may be done by a system of jacking or by burning or cutting the strands .
If the latter method is used the strands shall be cut by burning and the number of strands cut at a time shall be such that the stress in the remaining strands will not reach the ultimatestrength of the strands after due allowance has been made for the friction in the bed .
They shall be cut or burned between each pair of beams in the casting bed so that all of the tension in these strands is transferred to the concrete before other strands are cut or burned .
A symmetrical pattern shall be followed in releasing the tension by this method .
In order for release of the III .
Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges strands to occur gradually they should not be quickly cut but should be heated until the metal gradually loses its strength .
Draped pretensioned strands should be detensioned in accordance with the following A .
Unless the total load of the precast concrete member is as much as twice the total of the forces required to hold the strands in the low position within the member or unless the members are loaded or restrained in an approved manner to resist the uplifting forces on the member at the holddown points the following sequence should be followed for detensioning .
Release the tensions in the draped strands at the ends of the members by heating each strand until it fails .
The draped strands should be heated to failure at each uplifted point in accordance with an approved sequence as shown on the working drawings. . All holddown devices for the draped strands should be released and the holddown bolts within the members removed . .
If any straight pretensioned strands are located within the members they should be detensioned after the draped strands have been detensioned .
Straight strands shall be detensioned by releasing the tension in these strands gradually and uniformly .
B .
When the total load of the precast concrete member is more than twice the total of the forces required to hold the deflected strand in the low position within the member the following sequence may be used at the fabricators option for detensioning the prestressed strands .
Holddown devices for the deflected strands may be released and the holddown bolts within the members removed. . Deflected strands and straight strands may be detensioned by releasing the tension in the strands gradually and uniformly .
When the total load of the member is less than twice the total of the holddown forces loads or approved vertical restraint may be applied to the member in order to counteract the uplifting forces at the holddown points when holddown devices are released .
The load or approved vertical restraint added to the member should be placed directly over the holddown points for the deflected strands .
When the total of the load of the member plus the added loads or restraint is more than twice the holddown forces the stranddetensioning method of releasing holddown devices before strand tension may be followed .
It is very important that the procedures for transfer of prestressing forces to members with deflected pretensioned strands are followed .
Disregarding the procedures for transferring the forces to the members will probably result in unacceptable members .

Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. METRIC UNITS TERMS SYMBOLS AND CONVERSION FACTORS THE BASIC METRIC SYSTEM Base Units There are seven metric base units of measurement six of which are used commonly in design and construction .
The seventh mole is the amount of molecular substance and is used primarily in physics and chemistry .
Base Units Quantity Unit Symbol length meter m mass kilogram kg time second s electric current ampere A temperature kelvin K luminous intensity candela cd Derived Units Fifteen units with special names are derived from the base units and commonly used in engineering calculations .
Derived Units Quantity Name Symbol Expression frequency hertz Hz Hz s force newton N N kgms pressure stress pascal Pa Pa Nm energy work quantity of heat joule J J Nm power radiant flux watt W W Js electric charge quantity coulomb W W As electric potential volt V V WA or JC capacitance farad F F CV electric resistance ohm Ω Ω VA electric conductance siemens S S AV or Ω magnetic flux weber Wb Wb Vs magnetic flux density tesla T T Wbm inductance henry H H WbA luminous flux lumen lm lm cdsr illuminance lux lx lx lmm Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. Decimal Prefixes Many numbers resulting from metric calculation using the units above are too large or small to be practically used in design and construction .
Therefore three decimal prefixes are commonly used with the base units to produce a manageable number .
Decimal Prefixes Prefix Symbol Order of Magnitude Expression mega M one million kilo k one thousand milli m . one thousandth The prefixes giga G for one billion micro µ for one millionth and nano n for are used in some engineering calculations .
The metric system includes a number of additional historically used multiples such as centi c for one hundredth deci d for one tenth deca da for ten and hecto h for one hundred but these should be avoided as much as possible .
Pronunciation candela Accent the second syllable candellah .
hectare Accent the first syllable hecktare .
The second syllable rhymes with care .
joule Rhymes with pool .
kilometer Accent the first syllable killometer .
pascal Rhymes with rascal .
siemens Sounds like seamens .
RULES FOR WRITING METRIC SYMBOLS NAMES AND NUMBERS Print unit symbols in upright type and in lower case except for liter L or unless the unit name is derived from a proper name such as Pascal P. Print unit names in lower case even those derived from a proper name .
Print decimal prefixes in lower case for magnitudes and lower i.e .
k m µ and n and print the prefixes in upper case for magnitudes and higher e.g .
M and G. Leave a space between a numeral and a symbol write kg or .
mm not kg or .mm .
Exceptions No space is left between the numerical value and the symbols for degree minute and second of plane angle e.g .
write and not .
In the case of the symbol for the degree Celsius this space is optional but the degree symbol must always be attached to C e.g .
write C or C and not C. Do not leave a space between a unit symbol and its decimal prefix write kg not k g. Do not use the plural of unit symbols e.g .
write kg not kgs but do use the plural of written unit names e.g .. several kilograms .
For technical writing use symbols in conjunction with numerals e.g .
the area is m write out unit names if Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. numerals are not used e.g .
carpet is measured in square meters .
Numerals may be combined with written unit names in nontechnical writing e.g .
meters .
Indicate the product of two or more units in symbolic form by using a dot positioned above the line e.g .
kgms .
Do not mix names and symbols e.g .
write Nm or newton meter not Nmeter or newtonm .
Do not use a period after a symbol e.g .
write g not g. except when it occurs at the end of a sentence .
Always use decimals not fractions e.g .
write .
g not g. Use a zero before the decimal marker for values less than one e.g .
write .
g not .
g. Use spaces instead of commas to separate blocks of three digits for any number over four digits e.g .
write kg or .
kg or kg .
Note that this does not apply to the expression of amounts of money .
In the United States the decimal marker is a period in other countries a comma usually is used .
CONVERSION AND ROUNDING Soft Metric Conversion Soft Metric means No Physical Change .
This means that the product in question will not be physically modified to be used in a metric project but rather a direct mathematical conversion is performed to its exact or nearly exact metric equivalent .
All that is required is that the product literature and engineering data on these products be available with metric dimensions .
It is acceptable if product literature contains both metric and english dimensions .
Since product literature costs can be substantial firms without metric product literature need only develop a supplement to their existing literature .
Supplements will be accepted as submittals for an interim period .
There is no problem with competitive availability of soft converted products on a metric project since these same products are competitively available today .
In the future as standard international metric product sizes are developed by ISO International Standard Organization or another standards organization these products may undergo modification to be compatible in the world market .
Hard Metric Conversion Hard Metric means Product Requires Physical Change .
The product in question must be physically modified in order to be efficiently utilized in a metric project which is planned on a metric grid .
A handful of currently used construction products must undergo hard conversion to new metric sizes .
General Notes When converting numbers from inchpounds to metric round the metric value to the same number of significant digits as there were in the inchpound number e.g .
miles at .
kmmi equals .
km which rounds to km .
Convert mixed inchpound units feet and inches pounds and ounces to the smaller inchpound unit before converting to metric and rounding e.g .
feet inches inches inches x . mmin .
mm round to mm .
Wherever possible convert measurements to rounded rationalized hard metric numbers .
For instance if anchor bolts are to be embedded to a depth of inches the exact converted length of mm might be rounded to either Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. mm .
inches or mm .
inches .
The less critical the number the rounder it can be but ensure that allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded .
When in doubt stick with the exact soft conversion .
Round to preferred metric numbers .
While the preferred numbers for the foot inches system are in order of preference those divisible by and preferred metric numbers are in order of preference those divisible by .
and or decimal multiples thereof .
Use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert inchpounds to metric .
They are readily available and are indispensable to the conversion process .
Be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes metric numbers can be significantly larger than inchpound numbers a cubic meter for instance is one billion cubic millimeters .
VISUALIZING METRIC UNITS A few basic comparisons are worth remembering to help visualize metric units One meter is the length of a yardstick plus about inches .
One gram is about the mass weight of a large paper clip .
One kilogram is about the mass weight of a one liter bottle of soda about .
pounds One liter is about the volume of a inch cube x x millimeters .
One liter of water has a mass of kilogram .
One inch is just inch longer than millimeters inch .
millimeters millimeters inch .
Four inches are about inch longer than millimeters inches .
millimeters millimeters inches .
One foot is about inch longer than millimeters inches .
millimeters millimeters inches .
The metric equivalent of a typical foot by foot ceiling grid is x mm so metric ceiling tiles and lighting fixtures are about inch smaller in one dimension and inch smaller in the other .
Similarly the metric equivalent of a by sheet of plywood or drywall is x millimeters so metric sheets are about inch narrower and inches shorter .
Rounding down from multiples of inches to multiples of mm makes dimensions exactly .
percent smaller and areas about .
percent smaller .
About inch is lost in every linear foot .
One foot is about inch longer than millimeters inches .
millimeters millimeters inches .

USE OF METRIC UNITS IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Linear Measurement Length Use only the millimeter mm meter m and kilometer km in highway design and construction .
Use millimeters to represent all linear measurements less than one .
meter .
Use meters to represent all linear dimensions greater than one .
meter .
Use the kilometer for long distances and the micrometer for precision measurements .
Do not use the centimeter .
For survey measurement use the meter and the kilometer .
Survey stationing will be at meter intervals .
Since the U.S. basis of length measurement has been derived from metric standards .
In the definition of the length of the foot was changed from to .
exactly which resulted in the new value being shorter by two parts in a million .
At the same time it was decided that any data derived from and published as a result of geodetic surveys within the United States would remain with the old standard .
Thus all land measurements in U.S. customary units are based upon the U.S. survey foot which related to the meter by the old standard . . MHD survey is based on the U.S. survey foot .
Area The square meter m is preferred .
Very large areas may be expressed in square kilometers km and very small areas in square millimeters mm Use the hectare ha which is equal to square meters for land and water measurement only .
Do not use the square centimeter .
Linear dimensions such as mm x mm may be used if so indicate width first and length second .
Volume and Fluid Capacity Cubic meter m is preferred for dry volumes in construction and for large storage tanks .
Use liter L and milliliter mL for fluid capacity liquid volume .
Plane and Solid Angles and Slope Plane angles in surveying cartography will continue to be measured in degrees either decimal degrees or degrees minutes and seconds rather than the metric radian .
The radian rad and steradian sr denote plane and solid angles .
They are used in lighting work and in various engineering calculations .
Slope is expressed as a nondimensional ratio avoid the use of angles or percentages .
The vertical component is shown first and then the horizontal .
For instance a rise of one meter in four meters is expressed as .
The units that are compared should be the same meters to meters millimeters to millimeters etc .
Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. For slopes less than the vertical component should be unitary for example .
For slopes over the horizontal component should be unitary for example Time The preferred unit of time is the second s. In cases where time relates to life customs or calendar cycles the minute hour day and other calendar units may be necessary .
For example vehicle speed will normally be expressed in kilometers per hour .
Temperature Celsius temperature C formerly called centigrade is more commonly used than kelvin K and will be used by MHD .
Both have the same temperature gradients i.e .
Celsius temperature is simply .
degrees warmer than kelvin which begins at absolute zero .
For instance water freezes at .
K and at C while it boils at .
K and at C. To move between Celsius and Kelvin add or subtract .
i.e .
temperature in Celsius temperature in Kelvin minus .. Mass Force and Weight The kilogram kg is the base unit for mass which is the unit quantity of matter independent of gravity .
The metric ton t which is equal to kg is used to denote large loads such as those used in excavating .
The newton N is the derived unit for force mass times acceleration or kgms .
For calculations where the force is due to the selfweight of an object acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to .
ms .
The principal departure of the metric system from other measuring systems is the use of explicitly distinct units for mass and force .
In metric the name kilogram is restricted to the unit of mass and the kilogramforce from which the suffix force was in practice often erroneously dropped should not be used .
In its place the metric unit of force the newton is used see next page .
Likewise the newton rather than the kilogramforce is used to form derived units which include force for example pressure or stress Nm Pa energy Nm J and power Nms W. Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass .
In commercial and everyday use the term weight nearly always means mass thus when one speaks of a persons weight the quantity referred to is mass .
This nontechnical use of the term weight in everyday life will probably persist .
In science and technology the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that if applied to the body would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall .
The use of force of gravity mass time acceleration of gravity instead of weight with this meaning is often recommended .
Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear .
When the term is used it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use metric units properly by using kilograms for mass or newtons for force .
The term load means either mass or force depending on its use .
A load that produces a vertically downward force because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units kilograms .
Any other load is expressed in force units Newtons .
Pressure Stress and Elastic Modulus The pascal Pa is the unit for pressure and stress and is defined as Pa Nmm .
The term bar is not a metric unit and should not be used .
Structural calculations should be shown in MPa or kPa .
It may be convenient to note that MPa Nmm .
Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges E. Energy The joule J is the unit for energy and is defined as J Nm .
The joule is used wherever energy is specified such as energy absorption in Charpy Vnotch tests .
Do not use the joule to designate torque or bending moment always use newtonmeter Nm or kilonewton meter kNm .
