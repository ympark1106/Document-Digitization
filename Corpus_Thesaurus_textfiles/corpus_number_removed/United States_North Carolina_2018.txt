Omitted Unit Bid PriceAmount Bid CompletedQuantity Bid on is More Than One Unit In the case of a bid item for which the amount bid is completed extension of the unit bid price by the quantity but the unit bid price is omitted and the quantity shown in the proposal for the bid item is more than one unit the unit bid price shall be deemed to be the amount derived by dividing the amount bid for that item by the quantity shown in the proposal for that bid item and shall constitute the contract unit price for that bid item .
Discrepancy in the Unit Bid Price and the Amount Bid In the case of a bid item in which there is a discrepancy between the unit bid price and the extension for the bid item amount bid the unit bid price shall govern .
As an exception to the above on bids for contracts not funded with any federal funds the extension for the bid item amount bid shall govern when the discrepancy consists of an obvious clerical mistake in the unit bid price consisting of the misplacement of a decimal point .

Where the amount bid for a lump sum bid item is deemed to be zero except Mobilization as provided in this subarticle such zero amount bid shall constitute the contract lump sum price for that bid item .
In the case of omission of the amount bid for Mobilization the bid shall be deemed irregular and may be rejected .
b Federally Funded Projects In the case of omission of the unit bid price and the omission of the amount bid for any one item and in the case of the omission of the amount bid where a lump sum price is called for the bid will be considered nonresponsive and will not be considered for award .

Proceeding on limited production is based upon the Contractors initial evaluation of the straightedge test results and shall begin immediately upon obtaining those results .
Additionally the Engineer may direct the Contractor to proceed on limited production in accordance with Article due to unsatisfactory laydown or workmanship .
Section Limited production for unsatisfactory laydown is defined as being restricted to the production placement compaction and final surface testing of a sufficient quantity of mix necessary to construct only feet of pavement at the laydown width .
Once this lot is complete the final surface testing graphs will be evaluated jointly by the Contractor and the Engineer .
Remain on limited production until such time as acceptable laydown results are obtained or until three consecutive foot sections have been attempted without achieving acceptable laydown results .
The Engineer will determine if normal production may resume based upon the CSI for the limited production lot and any adjustments to the equipment placement methods andor personnel performing the work .
Once on limited production the Engineer may require the Contractor to evaluate the smoothness of the previous asphalt layer and take appropriate action to reduce andor eliminate corrective measures on the final surface course .
Additionally the Contractor may be required to demonstrate acceptable laydown techniques off the project limits before proceeding on the project .
If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory laydown results after three consecutive foot sections have been attempted cease production of that mix type until such time as the cause of the unsatisfactory laydown results can be determined .
As an exception the Engineer may grant approval to produce a different mix design of the same mix type if the cause is related to mix problems rather than laydown procedures .
If production of a new mix design is allowed proceed under the limited production procedures detailed above .
After initially proceeding under limited production the Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer if any additional lot on the project requires corrective action .
The Engineer will determine if limited production procedures are warranted for continued production .

Perform Vtype heating by the carefully planned and supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat .
When minor corrections in camber are required use small localized heats limited to the flange material .
Perform major corrections in camber by Vtype heating to prevent web distortion .
Begin heating at the apex of the heating pattern and progress slowly towards the base of the pattern as each area is brought up to temperature as stated in Subarticle D. Do not progress the heating torches toward the base of the heating pattern until the apex of the pattern is brought up to the specified temperature .
Do not return the heating torch toward the apex of the heating triangle after heating has progressed towards the base .
Continue heating to successive areas until the base of the triangular heating pattern is brought up to the required temperature across the full width of the flange .
Heat Cambering of Rolled Beams Heat cambering of rolled beams is allowed to provide the required vertical curvature .
Space triangular heating patterns throughout the length of the member to provide the required curvature .
Locate the apex of the heating triangle at a point not less than of the depth of the member measured from the flange that is concave after cambering .

Weld all detail material such as connection plates bearing stiffeners and gusset plates attached to the member to the rolled beam after the beam is cambered as required .
Heat Cambering of Welded Plate Girders Heat cambering of welded plate girders is only permitted when approved in writing as a necessary repair procedure for plate girders rejected for camber deviation .
When it is necessary to correct camber deviation in welded plate girders heating is permitted in Vtype heating patterns centered on intermediate stiffeners and connection plates .
Where necessary add stiffeners for this purpose if approved .
Section Locate the apex of the heating pattern not less than of the depth of the member from the flange that is shortened after cooling .
The maximum included angle of the heating pattern is .
The maximum width of the base of the heating pattern is inches .
Where shallow members or thin webs prescribe heating patterns with a width substantially less than inches at the junction of the web to flange extend the heating pattern in the flange at that location beyond the limits of the heating pattern in the web by no more than inch provided the total width of pattern in the flange does not exceed the inch limit stated above .
Support of Members for Heat Cambering Heat camber members with the web vertical and supports spaced to take the maximum advantage of dead load in the member before applying heat .
Ensure all supports are approved by the Departments inspector before beginning work .
Do not place any combination of support system or external load on the member that causes a compressive stress in the flange to exceed psi before heating for AASHTO M Grades and W steels .
Heating Process and Equipment Confine heating to the patterns described herein and conduct to bring the steel within the planned pattern to a temperature between F and F as rapidly as possible without overheating the steel .
Any heating procedure which causes a portion of the steel to exceed a temperature greater than F is destructive heating and is automatically cause for rejection of the steel .
Steel rejected for destructive heating is investigated for reacceptance repair or replacement if allowed by the Engineer .
Bear the cost of such tests and any necessary repair or replacement .
Heat Measurement Specified temperatures are checked using portable digital pyrometers or temperature indicating crayon .
When using a temperature indicating crayon the following procedure shall be employed mark on the surface of metal or sheet with the required crayon .
Once the surface reaches the rated temperature of the crayon the mark will melt and show liquid smear appearance .
At this point the heating operation shall cease to prevent overheating .
Exceeding the specified temperature is strictly prohibited .
E Heat Curving Girders Type of Heating With approval use continuous or Vtype heating methods to curve girders .
For the continuous method simultaneously heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flanges that is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
For Vtype heating heat the top and bottom flanges simultaneously in truncated triangular or wedgeshaped areas .
Position the areas with their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
Set the spacing and temperatures to approximate the required curvature by a series of short chords .
Heat along the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate .
For Vtype heating terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface just before the juncture of the web and flange .
To avoid web distortion make certain that heat is not applied directly to the web when heating the inside flange surfaces the surfaces that intersect the web .
Extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
Use an included angle of approximately to in the truncated triangular pattern but do not allow the base of the triangle to Section exceed inches .
Vary the patterns prescribed above only with the Engineers approval .
For both types of heating heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .
Concurrently heat both inside and outside flange surfaces for flange thicknesses of .
inches and greater .
Adhere to the temperature requirements presented below .
Temperature Conduct the heat curving operation so the temperature of the steel never exceeds F as measured by temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means .
Do not artificially cool the girder until it naturally cools to F. Below F use dry compressed air to artificially cool the girder .
Position for Heating Heatcurving the girder with the web in either a vertical or horizontal position is permitted .
When curved in the vertical position brace or support the girder so the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heatcurving process does not cause the girder to overturn .
When curved in the horizontal position support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points if required to obtain a uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges to exceed psi .
To prevent a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling when the girder is positioned horizontally for heating place intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process .
Sequence of Operations Conduct the heatcurving operation either before or after completing all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners to the web .
However unless provisions are made for shrinkage position and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners after heatcurving .
In any event weld the stiffeners connection plates and bearing stiffeners to the girder flanges after the member is curved .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required heatcurve or oxygencut these stiffeners separately before welding to the curved girder .
Camber and Curvature Camber the girders before heatcurving .
Cut the web to the prescribed camber allowing for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heatcurving .
If approved a carefully supervised application of heat is permitted to correct moderate deviations from the specified camber .
Horizontal curvature and vertical camber is measured for final acceptance after all welding and heating operations are complete and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
Horizontal curvature is checked with the web in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by using other suitable means .
Camber is checked with the web in the horizontal position .
Camber the girder so it meets the horizontal and vertical curvature ordinates without inducing stress into the girders by mechanical force .
Compensate for loss of camber in the heatcurved girders as residual stresses dissipate during service life of the structure .
Compute this anticipated loss of camber in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications .

Apply water evenly along the entire length of the bed .
When the ambient air temperature is below F cover the forms after the placement of the concrete and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the temperature of the air surrounding the member between F and F. After the concrete obtains an initial set of psi the air temperature surrounding the member is allowed to increase to F while continually maintaining moisture on the surface of the concrete .
Whenever heat is applied to the member place temperature recording clocks on the bed as required when curing at elevated temperatures .
The requirements for rate of temperature increase apply .
Maintain the application of heat if used and water until the concrete obtains release strength .

Use clear curing compound to which a fugitive dye is added for color contrast .
Section Apply the membrane curing compound after the surface finishing is complete and immediately after the free surface moisture disappears .
In the event the application of curing compound is delayed start another curing method immediately and continue until the application of the curing compound is started or resumed or until the concrete reaches the required detensioning strength .
Seal the surface with a single uniform coating of the specified type of curing compound applied at the rate of coverage recommended by the manufacturer or as directed by the Engineer but not less than one gallon per sf of area .
At the time of use thoroughly mix the compound in a condition with the pigment uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle .
If the application of the compound does not result in satisfactory coverage stop the method and apply water curing as set out above until the cause of the defective work is corrected .
At locations where the coating shows discontinuities pinholes or other defects or if rain falls on the newly coated surface before the film dries sufficiently to resist damage apply an additional coat of the compound immediately after the rain stops at the same rate specified herein .
When the ambient air temperature is below F cover the forms after the application of the curing compound and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the temperature of the air surrounding the member between F and F. Whenever heat is applied to the members place recording thermometers on the bed as required when curing at elevated temperatures .
The requirements for rate of temperature increase also apply .
Completely remove any curing compound adhering to a surface to which new concrete is bonded by sandblasting steel wire brushes bush hammers or other approved means .
Protect the concrete surfaces to which the compound is applied from abrasion or other damage that results in perforation of the membrane film until the concrete achieves design strength and the members are detensioned .
TRANSFER OF LOAD A producer quality control representative or equivalent qualified personnel shall be present during removal of forms and during transfer of load .
Transfer load from the anchorages to the members when the concrete reaches the required compressive strength shown in the plans .
Loosen and remove all formwork in one continuous operation as quickly as possible as soon as release strength is obtained .
As soon as the forms are removed and after the Departments Inspector has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the member transfer the load from the anchorages to the members as quickly as possible in one continuous operation using the approved detensioning sequence .
For any particular group of members cast in the same bed do not transfer the load to any concrete until the test cylinder breaks indicate that the concrete in all these members has reached the required strength as outlined in Subarticle B .
If these conditions are not met delay the transfer of the prestressing load to the concrete until tests of additional cylinders show that the required strength is reached .
When curing at elevated temperatures begin the procedures for transferring prestressing load immediately after curing is discontinued and the forms are released and while the concrete is still hot to prevent cooling shrinkage and cracking .
If so directed by the Engineer cover members or otherwise protect so as to cool the concrete slowly after release to prevent thermal shock and the evaporation of moisture in the members .
Section Transfer load to not cause cracks in members .
Transfer load by gradual release of the strands as a group by gradual release of part of the group or by burning the fully tensioned strands at the ends of the members .
If intending to release the strands by a method other than gradual release of the entire group submit six copies of the proposed method and pattern of release if not so shown in the plans for approval .
Rigidly follow the approved method and pattern of release .
When the fully tensioned strands are burned burn each strand or group of strands simultaneously at each end of the bed in its indicated order in the pattern and at each end of each member before proceeding to the strands in the next group in the pattern at any point .
Because of the critical nature of the bond development length in prestressed concrete panel construction if transferring of stress by burning the fully tensioned strands at the ends of the member burn each strand first at the ends of the bed and then at each end of each member before proceeding to the next strand in the burning pattern .
When detensioning all girders box beams cored slabs piles and panels do not burn strands quickly but heat with a low oxygen flame played along the strand for at least inches until the metal gradually loses its strength .
Apply heat at such a rate that failure of the first wire in each strand does not occur until at least seconds after heat is first applied .
When detensioning other members follow the above procedure unless an alternate procedure is approved .
Detensioning by arc welder is not allowed .
Incorporate the following in the method for single strand detensioning of members having draped strands A Release the pair of straight strands located in the uppermost position in the lower flange first .
B Then release the tension in the draped strands at the ends and uplift points in accordance with an approved pattern .
C Disengage all holddown devices for draped strands and release the holddowns .
D Then release the pair of straight strands located in the upper flange .
E Release the remaining straight strands of the pattern in accordance with an approved sequence .
F Release all strands in a manner meeting the Engineers approval that will cause a minimum shock and lateral eccentricity of loading .
Failure to follow the above procedures for transfer of load is ground for rejection of the members involved .
VERTICAL CRACKS IN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE GIRDERS BEFORE DETENSIONING This section addresses prestressed concrete members that have vertical casting cracks before strand detensioning .
Certain types of these cracks have been determined by the Department to render the girders unacceptable .
Unacceptable cracked members are those with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a distance less than the member depth which extend into the bottom flange .
Such members are not serviceable and will be rejected .
Members with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a distance less than the member depth but do not extend into the bottom flange are subject to an engineering assessment .
Such members may not be serviceable and may be rejected .
Members with one or more vertical cracks that extend into the bottom flange and are spaced at a distance greater than the member depth are subject to an engineering assessment to determine their acceptability .
If this engineering assessment is required submit at no additional cost to the Department a proposal for repairing the member and a structural evaluation of the member prepared by an engineer licensed by the State of North Carolina .
Section In the structural evaluation consider the stresses under full service loads had the member not cracked and the effects of localized loss of prestress at the crack as determined by methods acceptable to the Department .
All members except those defined as unacceptable which exhibit vertical cracks before detensioning shall receive a day water cure as directed by the Engineer .
The water cure shall begin within hours after detensioning the prestressing strands and shall be at least feet beyond the region exhibiting vertical cracks .
The Department has the final determination regarding acceptability of any members in question .

SECTION EPOXY AND ADHESIVES EPOXY RESIN SYSTEMS A Classification The types of epoxies and their uses are as shown below Type A lowmodulus nonsag gel adhesive used to bond or repair damp vertical or overhead surfaces .
Typical applications include walls concrete foundations concrete pipe conduit and ceilings .
Type A lowmodulus generalpurpose adhesive used in epoxy mortar repairs .
It may be used to patch spalled cracked or broken concrete where vibration shock or expansion and contraction are expected .
Featheredged patching is not recommended with this material instead the adjacent concrete perimeter should be sawed at least inch to inch deep and any remaining concrete chipped away to provide a vertical interface between the epoxy mortar and concrete .
Type A highmodulus generalpurpose adhesive used to bond plastic concrete or hardened concrete to hardened concrete or other structural materials .
It may be used to produce a highstrength epoxy mortar grout bed for equipment or to patch interior spalls cracks or broken concrete .
It is not recommended for exterior patching because its rate of thermal expansion and contraction differs too greatly from concrete .
It may be used for anchoring bolts where a flowable adhesive is required .
Section Type A A gellike version of Type used specifically for embedding dowel bars threaded rods rebars and other fixtures in hardened concrete .
Type A A gray protective coating for concrete wood steel and other structural materials .
It is typically used as a topcoat in waterproofing concrete exposed to splash zones and tidal water .
