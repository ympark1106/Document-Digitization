Load trucks in manner to minimize segregation of the mixture according to the approved QCP .
Do not clean out truck beds on the roadway ahead of the paver .
Provide a location away from the roadway or off the project for cleaning trucks .
If there is excessive sticking of material in truck beds the sticking is in areas of the truck that would indicate excessive cooling of the mix front corners bottom etc .
due to a long haul and it is not resolved in a reasonable time the Engineer will require an insulated bed .
The Contractor may only make procedure changes for better mix handling at the discretion of OMM .
Equip each truck with a securely fastened waterproof cover of suitable material to protect the mixture from wind and weather .

Conform to the requirements of Item .
Before manufacturing asphalt concrete demonstrate to the Monitoring Team that the Contractors facility adequately meets the specification requirements .
Calibrate the plant using procedures approved by the Department .
Perform initial calibrations in the presence of the Monitoring Team .
District Testing may request a letter of certification and certified data documenting the calibration results instead of having the Monitoring Team present .
Verify the calibrations biweekly using a Quick Calibration .
However District Testing may request additional Quick Calibrations if there are mix production problems or plant operation concerns .
The Quick Calibration is a quality control procedure developed by the Contractor that verifies the accuracy of a facility to proportion materials to meet the current JMF .
Include the Quick Calibration procedure and data forms in the QCP in accordance with .. H. If the difference between current calibration and the Quick Calibration is within percent then the current calibration is acceptable .
If the percent variation is exceeded perform a recalibration of the facility .
Document the Quick Calibration procedure as specified in the QCP and post the procedure and results in plain view in the plant control room and plant laboratory for reference by the Monitoring Team .
Document all data from calibrations in a format approved by OMM and retain the data for review by the Monitoring Team .

If the random Department VA sampling and testing verifies the accompanying Contractor tests the average of the Contractors quality control tests for each day or night for Basic mix the average of the Contractors tests for each Lot for acceptance mix or daily average MSG acceptance mix will be used to determine acceptance .
A .
Sampling .
District Testing will perform the VA by testing independent and split samples .
For plant sampling for Basic mixes or quality control testing the Contractors technician will randomly select the truck in which to take a sample by using a random number procedure as outlined in the QCP .
The Contractors technician will give no indication to anyone of the time that the sample is to be taken .
For other than job start previous mix production problems low production tonnage or as requested by the Monitoring Team exclude the first three trucks from sampling .
Include the random number sample tonnage location and time of sampling on the daily Quality Control Report Contractor form TE with each test .
Tests other than the required random sample tests are at the Contractors discretion according to the QCP .
Provide a clean area of sufficient size and a hard surface to perform sample splitting .
Split samples by quartering and recombining only as described in AASHTO T Method B for hard surfaces for the Department and Contractors sample .
The split sample size required is generally to pounds to g. A mechanical quartering device approved by OMM may be used in lieu of the above but only split according to the procedure outlined in the Contractor QCP .
Ensure that every quality control or Sublot sample taken by the technician has a labeled split for the Department .
Wrap and label split samples as to Lot or Sublot time location tonnage and accompanying Contractor test identification .
The Monitoring Team will pick up all Department split samples within workdays .
Sample mishandling careless identification changing sample size consistency or pretesting will result in a change to Unconditional Acceptance .
For acceptance mixes conform to the procedures of Supplements and except take samples from a truck at the plant .
If workmanship problems continue on the project segregation etc .
or if quality control problems persist District Testing may require sampling on the road according to Supplement .
Lots will be tons metric tons and Sublots will be tons metric tons .
However when production is limited to less than tons metric tons consider the quantity produced as a partial Lot .
For partial Lots of tons metric tons or less sample and test at least two sublot samples regardless of the tons produced .
Split and test all sublot samples taken by the Contractor from locations selected by the Monitoring Team or Engineer .
The Contractor may test a QC sample at the required Sublot sample location as both a QC and Sublot test provided the sample is tested for all required quality control properties .
Test results will apply for both QC and sublot requirements .
A change in the location of the Sublot sample must be approved by the Monitoring Team and be reasonably close to the original location .
This allowance does not apply to any other samples including Department VA sample locations selected by the Monitor .
Label Department split samples as Sublot or quality control samples .
For acceptance mixes MSG VA testing will be performed by District Testing on a minimum of one in every four required District sampled Daily samples .
Other properties can be tested for by the District as desired .
B .
Reporting .
Report all testing performed and sample identification on a Quality Control Report Contractor form TE .
Record on the TE if the mixture produced was ran at the asphalt plant as a hot mix asphalt HMA or as a warm mix asphalt WMA produced according to .
or another approved method .
Deliver fax email hand completed Quality Control Reports to District Testing by the end of each day in which testing is conducted .
If desired by District Testing and always for unsigned Email versions mail the originals .
After startup adjustments report any plant operation changes on the Quality Control Report .
Ensure that each Quality Control Report contains technician comments as to production quality input materials received and condition and includes any other quality control activities as specified in the QCP .
Ongoing problems with inadequate incomplete or illegible reporting will result in a change to Unconditional Acceptance .
The Contractors technician must sign each Quality Control Report .
Report test results to the accuracy of the following decimal places .
When the figures to be dropped in rounding off are exactly onehalf of unity in the decimal place to be retained round the value up to the nearest number in the decimal place to be retained .
Single Test Average Asphalt Binder Content . . No .
µm sieve . . Other sieves Whole number .
BSG . . For acceptance mixes track the Item Sublot and Lot tonnages through the project and identify on the Quality Control Report each random Sublot test as to Lot number and Sublot tonnage location .
In addition to the Quality Control Report submit the TE Department form with lot identification and actual sieve weights for each Sublot sample from the technicians gradation worksheets .
Attach computerized plant printouts representing samples tested to that days report if desired by the Monitoring Team or otherwise keep them with the quality control records .
Ensure that the technician notes on the accompanying printout from which tonnage the quality control sample was taken with accompanying test results for AC content and percent passing the No. . mm sieve .
Keep remaining printouts in the plant laboratory for the duration of the project .
Keep a copy of all quality control reports for a project in the Contractors plant laboratory .
C. Department Verification Testing and Monitoring .
For Basic and acceptance mixes the Monitor will randomly choose one Department sample in a maximum of every four production days for VA testing to confirm Contractor testing and mix control .
More frequent VA samples can be taken when desired .
The Department VA sample location will be chosen randomly by the Monitor including where in the truck to take the sample if applicable .
The Contractor technician will take the sample from the truck with the Monitor witnessing .
The Monitor will keep the sample in the Departments possession until delivered to District Testing or testing is complete .
The Monitor will have enough sample taken to split with the Contractor .
The Monitor will split the sample in the Contractor lab .
The Monitor will have the sample tested at District Testing or as noted below .
The Contractor will test his split of the VA sample with the Monitor witnessing .
The Department will use its VA test result the Contractor result of the split as well as the most recent previous day or night Contractor quality control andor sublot test in the comparison for the Department VA testing .
The Monitor may opt to test the Department VA sample in the plant laboratory with the Contractors permission according to the Contractors safety practices and with the restriction of only the Contractors technician physically placing a sample pan in the AC Gauge .
However if the Monitor tests VA samples on Contractor equipment test a VA sample on District Testing equipment a minimum of one time in production days from a given plant regardless of the number of projects or JMFs tested in the Level lab .
Record the results and testing location in the District Testing project record .
One day may be added to the above Department sample testing frequency for each day production is less than tons metric tons .
For acceptance mixes MSG VA testing will be performed by District Testing on a minimum of one in every four required Districtsampled Daily samples .
This result will be compared to that days Contractor average of MSG QC test results .
For all mixes the District may increase the number of VA testing samples if desired .
All Department VA test results will be given to the Contractor by a reasonable arrangement acceptable to both .
Department VA sample testing not completed in a timely manner is of no value in verifying quality control testing quality for Contractor test acceptance andor investigating problem causes .
As such if not completed in a timely manner Contractor tests will automatically stand and the District will note the problem in the Districts VA record .

The Contractor may request a review with the Department occasionally for the purpose of determining the cause of a comparison problem .
Department decisions upon review are final .
If a Contractor is requesting a review of every occurrence of lack of comparison and the Department test is always found correct the Department may deny that Contractor further reviews .
For all other mixes if the Department VA test does not verify the accompanying Contractor tests within the verification tolerances then the Monitoring Team will investigate .
If the deviation between the District and Contractor test is greater than the limits in Table .
immediately cease production until resolved .
If the deviation is less than the limits in Table .
and discrepancies continue perform additional tests to aid in problem solving .

If the additional testing does not resolve the problem by onehalf production day or tons metric tons whichever occurs first to the Monitoring Teams satisfaction stop production if not already until problems are resolved .
Contact OMM for assistance in resolving problems .
If the District testing program is confirmed by the additional tests and Monitoring Team investigation and no reason to question the original test exists then the original District VA tests will stand .
After the above investigation one of the three following actions will occur .
Mix Production Compares Well to the JMF .
If the District test and investigation shows mix is actually controlled well compared to the JMF in spite of the Contractor test the District does not have to test additional samples if the Contractor testing problem is corrected . .
Mix Production Does Not Compare Well to the JMF .
If the District tests and investigation shows lack of Contractor mix control compared to the JMF the District will test the remaining Department split or Daily samples for the days or Lots represented by the original tests .
The District will use the test results to calculate the acceptance .
While working with the District immediately take steps to correct the problem according to the QCP .
Failure to achieve a quick resolution will result in a change to Unconditional Acceptance. . District Testing Problem .
If the District testing program has a problem as confirmed by the additional testing and District review the District will correct the problem throw out the original District test results and take new samples from the samples representing the days or Lots in question for the VA tests .
F. Contractor Removal Restoration .
For MSG for a given Contractor facility if in a series of or more Contractor Department MSG comparison tests VA Monitoring tests the Contractor MSG is lower than the Department MSG by more than .
and occurs a minimum of percent of the time the facility will be removed from Department MSG Verification Acceptance and operate under .. At a minimum a report will be issued annually of the Contractor Department MSG comparison status of each facility for this determination .
This frequency may be increased .
For all other mixes if repeated problems with poor comparison of tests are not the Districts fault or poor comparison of Contractor tests to the JMF or with plant operation input materials or any of the other requirements of Department specifications occur in a single project or successive projects the District will request an opinion from the QCQC before notifying the Contractor of removal from Department VA .
The District will immediately notify the Contractor of the removal with a follow up letter from District Testing .
Once notified acceptance of asphalt mixtures is by Unconditional Acceptance .
Restoration of the VA procedures may occur on a future project with a District recommendation to the QCQC based on consistent improved plant operation and mix control a review of the Contractor problems and resolutions and a review of the QCP by the QCQC . .
Unconditional Acceptance .
If the Contractor is removed from Department VA the following will occur .
The Contractor must bring its QCP and operation to a level acceptable to the District and QCQC before production continues .
District Testing will ensure that the project C Contractors Prequalification Rating survey reflects the change to Unconditional Acceptance in all of the appropriate C categories .
The Department will accept all material for Department projects from the facility under Unconditional Acceptance .
While the facility is under Unconditional Acceptance acceptance of small quantities under the small quantities policy will not apply .
Quality control testing requirements specified in .
are modified as follows A .
The required number of test series is a minimum of four each per production day or night .
If a production day is less than hours the Department may reduce the frequency but not less than one test series per every production hours .
This requirement does not apply to MSG as outlined below .
B .
For Basic mixes if the variation from the JMF for one test is percent passing the No. . mm sieve or .
percent asphalt binder content investigate and correct the problem then resample and test .
Maintain the moving average of three tests within percent passing the No. . mm sieve and .
percent asphalt binder content .
In addition to the Quality Control Report maintain control charts according to .
for asphalt binder content and the No. . mm sieve .
If the Range difference in any three consecutive tests is greater than .

Furnish selfpropelled spreading and finishing machines capable of consolidating and finishing the concrete and producing a finished surface meeting the requirements specified .
Ensure that all paving equipment is operated in a manner that does not result in segregation of the mixture or loss of air entrainment in the mixture .
Construct pavement using either fixed forms or slip form paving equipment that conforms to the following A .
Fixed Form Construction .
Spread screed and consolidate concrete using one or more machines between previously set side forms .
Furnish an adequate number and capacity of machines to perform the work at a rate equal to the concrete delivery rate .
Furnish machines capable of uniformly distributing and consolidating the concrete without segregation .
Provide machines capable of operating on two side forms on adjacent lanes of pavement and one side form or on two adjacent lanes as necessary .

Remove from the work any machine that causes displacement of the side forms from the line or grade or causes undue delay as determined by the Engineer due to mechanical difficulties .
Finish small areas irregular areas and areas that are inaccessible to finishing equipment using other methods as approved by the Engineer .
Accomplish vibration of these areas using hand held or machine mounted internal vibrators .
Continue vibration to achieve adequate consolidation without segregation for the full depth and width of the area placed .
Use straight edge side forms made of steel and of a depth equal to the specified pavement thickness .
Do not use bent or damaged side forms or forms with damaged joint locks or pin pockets .
Provide forms in sections of not less than ft m in length without horizontal joints in the height of the form .
Utilize forms with a nominal base width of at least inches mm .
Ensure forms are capable of supporting the paving equipment without shifting or deforming during paving .

Do not use builtup forms except to construct pavement of a specified thickness whose total area for the project is less than square yards m. Provide forms with adequate joint locks to tightly join ends of abutting form sections together .
B .
Slip Form Construction .
Place concrete using an industrystandard slip form paver designed to spread consolidate screed and finish the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine and with a minimum of hand finishing providing a dense and homogeneous pavement .
Consolidate the full width and depth of concrete pavement placed by a single pass of approved internal vibrators .
Operate the vibrators at a frequency range of to impulses per minute .
Attach vibrators to either the spreading or finishing equipment in such a manner that they do not come in contact with preset dowel basket assemblies the subgrade reinforcing mesh or side forms .
Do not operate vibrators in a manner to cause a separation of the mix ingredients segregation i.e .
either a downward displacement of large aggregate particles or an accumulation of laitance on the surface of the concrete .
Avoidance of segregation may require reduction in the vibration frequency within the range specified when forward motion of the paver is reduced .
Connect the power to all vibrators so they stop when the machine motion is stopped .
Stop paving operations if any vibrator fails to operate within the above specified range .
Provide an electronic monitoring device that displays the operating frequency of each internal vibrator when paving mainline ramps accelerationdeceleration lanes and collector distributor lanes .
Ensure the monitoring device has a readout display near the paver operators controls visible to the operator and the Engineer .
Operate the monitoring device continuously while paving and display all vibrator frequencies with manual or automatic sequencing among individual vibrators .
Using the monitoring system record the following minimum information time of day station location paver track speed and the frequency of each individual vibrator .
Make recordings after each feet m of paving or after minute intervals of time .
If not using a monitoring system with a recorder make and record readings every minutes .
Provide vibration data in electronic format to the Engineer prior to the next concrete placement .
Electronic vibration monitoring devices are not required for paving machines used to construct shoulders gores or for any construction project with a total of less than square yards m of pavement .
When electronic monitoring devices are not required use a tachometer or similar device to demonstrate to the Engineer the paving equipment vibration meets specification .
Operate the slip form paver with as nearly a continuous forward movement as possible .
Coordinate all operations of mixing delivering and spreading concrete to provide uniform progress with minimal stopping and starting of the paver .
If for any reason it is necessary to stop the forward movement of the paver immediately stop the consolidation devices .
Unless controlled from the machine do not apply any other tractive force to the machine .
Accurately control the finish grade of the pavement from a preset grade line parallel to the finish grade .
Use equipment with controls that will trace the grade line and automatically adjust the grade of the screed .
In areas where adjoining concrete pavement is to be constructed ensure that the surface at the edge of the pavement on either side of the longitudinal joint does not vary more than inch mm below the typical section .
Ensure that the outside edges of the pavement does not vary more than inch mm below the typical section .
Ensure that all pavement edges are nearly vertical with no projections or keyways exceeding inch mm .
In the area of construction joints placed at the end of the days run the Engineer will allow a reduction of approximately inches mm in overall width . .
Setting Forms .

This work consists of designing cofferdams and excavation bracing and excavating materials not removed under other items of work that must be removed to enable construction of bridges and other structures .
Included in this work are A. constructing maintaining and subsequently removing cofferdams and excavation bracing B. dewatering and backfilling the excavation C. protecting the excavation against collapse and D. disposing of materials not required or suitable for backfill . .
Classification .
Excavation is classified as unclassified excavation unclassified excavation including rock or shale or rock or shale excavation. . Cofferdams and Excavation Bracing .
This item includes the preparation of an Engineered drawing according to .
and the construction maintenance and subsequent removal of all cofferdams and excavation bracing .
A cofferdam is an enclosure within a water environment constructed to allow dewatering for the purpose of creating a dry work environment .
Excavation bracing is that required to safely support the sides of excavations embankments adjacent buildings tracks or other premises .
Construct cofferdams and excavation bracing such that support members clear the top of the footings by at least foot .
m. If this is not practical support members shall be structural steel and left it in place .
If bracing is to be left in place and the ends would not be visible when the structure is completed burn off the steel ends flush with the concrete surface .
If ends would be visible form a inch mm deep recess around the steel embedment and remove the external portion of the embedment to provide at least inches mm of clearance to the finished concrete face .
Completely fill the resulting recess with concrete .
Where water is not encountered the Contractor may place excavation bracing at the plan dimension of the footing and use it as formwork for footing concrete .
Leave this sheeting in place at least to the top of the footing or properly separate it from the footing concrete so that it may be removed without damaging the concrete .
Where water is encountered and cofferdams are necessary construct them practically watertight before excavating below water level .
Make provisions outside the footing to drain collect and remove water .
When placing concrete keep the excavation dewatered until the concrete is above the prevailing water level .
Effectively protect footing concrete from erosion .
If using a concrete seal to stop the flow upward from the bottom of a cofferdam place the seal below the planned footing and consider it as a part of the cofferdam .
The Department will not pay for a seal unless it is shown on the plans .
Unless otherwise shown in the plans design and construct cofferdams to accommodate a water elevation feet .
m above the ordinary high water mark shown on the plans .
If the actual water elevation exceeds feet .
m above the stated ordinary high water mark the Department will reimburse the Contractor for any resulting damage to the work protected by the cofferdam provided the Contractor has exercised normal due diligence .
If the actual water elevation exceeds feet .
m above the ordinary high water mark and causes a delay to the project the Department will grant the Contractor an excusable noncompensable delay in accordance with .. B .
Establish a monument upstream of all proposed cofferdams to visually monitor the water elevation in the waterway .
Maintain the monument throughout the project .
Provide a visual mark on the monument that identifies the required high water elevation as defined above .
Ensure that the monument can be read from the bank of the waterway .
Have this elevation set and certified by an Ohio Registered Surveyor .
Cofferdams may be designed and constructed to accommodate a lower water elevation however the Department will not reimburse the Contractor for repairs to work damaged nor grant additional time unless the water elevation exceeds feet .
m above the ordinary high water mark shown on the plan .
Submit any request for reimbursement for repair to work damaged or for delay to the Engineer with information substantiating that the water elevation was more than feet .
m above the ordinary high water mark shown on the plans. . Protection for Excavation .
Protect all excavations from caving .
Do not disturb the material below the bottom of footings .
Perform blasting in a manner that avoids damage to the material supporting the structure vertically or laterally and that avoids subsequent slides that damage the structure road or adjacent property .
If the material below the bottom of footings not supported by piles is disturbed remove it and fill the entire space with concrete at no expense to the Department .
Under footings supported on piles replace and compact the over excavated or disturbed material as the Engineer directs .
If backfilling is necessary to correct caving or slides backfill according to .. Excavation adjacent to railroad tracks are subject to the supervision of the involved railway company .
Provide sufficient bracing to ensure the proper support of the roadbed and tracks. . Footings in Rock .
Where rock or shale excavation is a separate pay item fill the portion of the excavation into rock or shale that is below the top of footing with concrete .
If removing rock or shale as part of Unclassified Excavation and the footing is designed to be keyed into the bedrock confine the excavation into bedrock for the minimum specified depth of keying within the area bounded by the outer edge of the footing .
Fill excavation outside these limits and within and below the keyed depth with concrete. . Approval of Foundations .
Notify the Engineer when the excavation is to be completed to the depth shown on the plans .
Do not place footings until the Engineer has approved the subfoundation . .
Disposal of Excavated Material .
Dispose of excavated material not needed or not suitable according to .
and .. Use other suitable excavation material for backfill. . Backfill .
Backfill all excavations made under this item with materials conforming to .. R except behind abutments and below the approach slabs use materials conforming to Item Granular Material Type B .
Place and compact the backfill materials according to .
and .
except as modified by this subsection .
Do not place backfill material against any structural element until the Engineer has approved the element .
In bridge abutment areas compact backfill material to meet the compaction requirements in ..
Elsewhere compact backfill material to percent of the maximum laboratory dry density .
When a test section method is used for compaction acceptance Use compaction equipment with a total weight or a centrifugal force of least ton .
metric tons .
Supply the manufacturers information to verify this information .
Use at least six passes to construct the production areas .
Use at least percent of the test section maximum dry density for acceptance of the production areas .
The Contractor does not have to place backfill material around piers that are not within the embankment area or adjacent to a roadway or a railway in thin layers or compact it but should leave the backfill material in a neat condition with a compensating allowance made for settlement .
Backfill in front of abutments and around piers to the ground lines shown on the plans .
Backfill all structural foundation units as soon as practical after the required conditions of this subsection are met to avoid the ponding of surface water and the accumulation of debris .

Description .
This work consists of applying a static load to a driven pile and furnishing instruments and facilities to obtain loaddisplacement data required to determine the ultimate bearing value of the pile .
When subsequent static load tests are specified the Office of Geotechnical Engineering will determine whether subsequent static load tests are to be performed and the location of all piles to be tested. . General .
Perform the static load test according to ASTM D Procedure A Quick Test except as modified below .
Use the hammer selected for driving the test pile to drive all piles represented by the test .
If the Contractor finds it necessary to use a different hammer the Office of Geotechnical Engineering will determine if an additional static load test is necessary .
If using anchor piles to apply the load to the test pile locate the anchor piles to provide a minimum clear distance of feet .
m from the test pile .
The Contractor may use battered piles as anchor piles provided the horizontal forces in the anchor system are balanced and excessive bending stresses are not induced in the piles .
The Contractor may also use bearing piles meeting these requirements as anchor piles .
After the test has been completed remove or cut off at least foot .
m below the bottom of the footing or finished surface of the ground all anchor piles outside the limits of the footing .
Cut off anchor piles other than bearing piles within the limits of the footing inches mm above the bottom of the footing .
Redrive all bearing piles used as anchor piles that are displaced upward during the application of the test load according to the plan requirements .

To avoid column buckling of the pile ensure that tested piles are substantially vertical and that the load is applied to the pile at a point as near the ground surface as possible .
Provide equipment and loading apparatus to apply a maximum test load of twice the ultimate bearing value .
Have a Registered Engineer design the loading apparatus .
Determine if piles on the plan order list for castinplace reinforced concrete piles have a pile wall thick enough to support the maximum test load of twice the ultimate bearing value .
The minimum pile wall thickness to support twice the ultimate bearing value is t inch R lb t mm R N D inch D mm Where t pile wall thickness in inches mm R ultimate bearing value in pounds N D diameter of pile in inches mm If the pile wall thickness for the test pile is less than t before performing the static load test either drive a test pile with a thicker pile wall or fill the pile with concrete and allow the concrete to cure for days .
The static load test is unacceptable if the pile fails internally during the test due to improper installation or procedure by the Contractor. . Test Procedure .
Apply the load at least days after placing concrete in the pile or hours after driving both the test pile and the anchor piles .
Use displacement indicators as the primary system to measure axial movement of the test pile top with a redundant secondary system as described in ASTM D. Apply the test load in increments of approximately onetenth the ultimate bearing value .
Between each load increment keep the test load constant for minutes .
Add load increments until the test load reaches twice the ultimate bearing value or until continuous jacking is required to maintain the test load .
Remove the test load in five approximately equal decrements keeping the test load constant for minutes between decrements .
If it is necessary to remove and reapply the load during the test use the same loading procedure to reapply the test load .
Record test readings taken at and minutes after completing application of each load increment .
Record test readings taken at and minutes after each load decrement and after removing all load from the test pile .
Determine the load test ultimate bearing value Qf using the Davisson criteria .
First plot the displacement versus load on the pile Q .
Next draw a line representing the theoretical elastic deformation of the pile using the following equation .
d Q L A E Where d Elastic deformation of pile in inches mm Q Test load in pounds N L Length of pile in inches mm A crosssectional area of pile in square inches mm² E Elastic modulus of pile in lbin² MPa for steel E lbin² MPa Draw the Davisson criteria line parallel to the theoretical elastic deformation but offset by the following formula .

Take precautions to prevent damaging existing structures and utilities .
Precautions include but are not limited to selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent excessive caving of the shaft excavation and monitoring and controlling the vibrations from the driving of casing or sheeting or drilling of the shaft .
When encountered remove objects such as large boulders .
Do not blast unless shown on the plans or authorized in writing by the Engineer .
Unless otherwise shown on the plans where drilled shafts are to be installed in conjunction with embankment placement construct shafts after the placement of the fill and completion of any specified settlement periods .
Excavate for the shafts to the dimensions and elevations shown on the plans .
Use methods and equipment suitable for the intended purpose and materials encountered .
Use either the dry method wet method temporary casing method or permanent casing method as necessary to produce sound durable concrete foundation shafts free of defects .
When a particular method of construction is required on the plans that method shall be used .
If no particular method is specified for use select and use a method based on site conditions .
If the excavation operation is stopped protect the shaft cavity by installing a safety cover .
The Contractor is responsible for the safety of the shaft excavation surrounding soil and the stability of the sidewalls .
If necessary to ensure such safety and stability use a temporary casing slurry or other methods accepted by the Engineer .
Unless cased to the full depth do not leave excavations unfilled overnight .
Use appropriate means such as a cleanout bucket or air lift to clean the bottom of the excavation of all shafts .
Promptly notify the Engineer when unexpected obstructions are encountered .
A .
Dry Construction Method .
Use the dry construction method only at sites where the groundwater table and site conditions are suitable to allow construction of the shaft in a relatively dry excavation and where the sides and bottom of the shaft remain stable without any caving sloughing or swelling and may be visually inspected before placing the concrete .
The dry method consists of excavating the drilled shaft hole removing accumulated water and loose material from the excavation and placing the shaft concrete in a relatively dry excavation .
The rate of flow of water into the hole should not be more than inches mm within a hour period .
Do not place the initial concrete if there is more than inches mm of water in the bottom of the hole .
B .
Wet Construction Method .
Use the wet construction method at sites where a dry excavation can not be maintained for placement of the shaft concrete .
The wet method consists of using water or slurry to contain seepage and groundwater movement and placing concrete using a tremie or concrete pump .
Additionally use this method to maintain stability of the hole perimeter while advancing the excavation to its final depth placing the reinforcing cage and placing the shaft concrete .
This method also consists of desanding and cleaning the slurry .
For drilled shafts that are not socketed into the bedrock and during drilling operations maintain a water or slurry fluid elevation inside the shaft excavation higher than the static water table .
Unless demonstrated to the Engineers satisfaction that the surface casing is not required provide temporary surface casings to aid shaft alignment and position and to prevent sloughing of the top of the shaft excavation .
Extend surface casings from the ground surface to a point in the shaft excavation where sloughing of the surrounding soil does not occur .
C. Temporary Casing Construction Method .
Use the temporary casing construction method when the stability of the excavated hole andor the effects of groundwater must be controlled .
Remove temporary casings while the concrete remains workable .
As the casing is being withdrawn maintain a foot .
m minimum head of fresh concrete in the casing so that all the fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward without contaminating the shaft concrete .
As necessary increase the required minimum concrete head to counteract groundwater head inside the casing .
Extract casing at a slow uniform rate with the pull in line with the shaft axis .
Rotate tap push down or vibrate the casing when necessary to extract it .
Rotate the casing as little as possible to avoid deforming the reinforcing steel cage .
D. Permanent Casing Construction Method .
The permanent casing construction method generally consists of driving or drilling a casing to a specified depth before excavation begins .
If full penetration of the casing to the specified depth can not be attained the Contractor may either excavate material within the embedded portion of the casing or excavate a pilot hole ahead of the casing until the casing reaches the desired penetration .
Make the pilot hole no larger than onehalf the diameter of the shaft and center the hole in the shaft .
Do not over ream to the outside diameter of the casing unless specifically shown on the plans .
Ensure that the casing is continuous between the elevations shown on the plans .
Unless otherwise shown on the plans do not use temporary casing instead of or in addition to the permanent casing .
After installing the casing and excavating the shaft place the reinforcing steel then place the shaft concrete .
After filling the permanent casing with concrete pressure grout voids between the shaft excavation and the casing with cement grout .
Submit the method of pressure grouting the voids to the Engineer for approval .
Pressure grouting is required to ensure contact bearing between the casing and any surrounding soil layer that is used for lateral support . .
Friction Type Drilled Shafts .
Friction type drilled shafts are defined as drilled shafts that do not bear on bedrock and obtain their ability to support load from a combination of end bearing on the soil and adhesion between soil and concrete along the length of the shaft .
For friction type drilled shafts dry construction method may be used for cohesive soils only .
If using a casing for the construction of a friction type drilled shaft remove the casing completely or partially as shown on the plans .
If enough water is entering the hole through the sides and bottom of the hole such that the supporting soils are being eroded maintain a positive head of fluid in the excavation hole to ensure that water is not continuously flowing into the hole .
If the Engineer determines that the hole sidewall has softened due to excavation methods swelled due to delays in concreting or degraded because of slurry cake buildup over ream the sidewall to sound material .
If the concrete is not placed the same day that the excavation is completed protect the excavation with a temporary casing and redrill the hole at least inches mm larger in diameter clean the excavation and perform slurry test before concreting. . Casings .
Use smooth watertight steel casings of sufficient strength to withstand handling and driving stresses and the concrete and surrounding earth pressures .
Provide an outside diameter of the steel casing equal to or greater than the plan diameter of the shaft .
If the plan diameter of the bedrock socket is same as the drilled shaft above the bedrock and a steel casing is used provide a diameter of the bedrock socket as shown on the plans .
Ensure that the diameter of the casing is large enough to allow the excavation of the bedrock socket .
Where drilled shafts are located in open water areas extend the casing a minimum of inches mm above the water to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete .
Cut off the casing at the plan top of drilled shaft elevation after the concrete has cured .
If practical install the casing in a manner that produces a positive seal at the bottom of the casing to prevent piping of water or entry of other material into the shaft excavation .
If it becomes necessary to remove a casing and substitute a longer or larger diameter casing through caving soils stabilize the excavation with slurry or backfill before installing the new casing .
The Contractor may use other methods accepted by the Engineer to control the stability of the excavation and to protect the integrity of the foundation soils. . Slurry .
Slurry used in the drilling process shall be a mineral or polymer slurry .
The mineral slurry shall have both a mineral grain size that remains in suspension and sufficient viscosity and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to a suitable screening system .
Ensure that the percentage and specific gravity of the material used to make the suspension is sufficient to maintain the stability of the excavation and to allow proper concrete placement .
Maintain the level of the slurry at a height sufficient to prevent caving of the hole .
Thoroughly premix the mineral slurry with clean fresh water and allow adequate time for hydration before introduction into the shaft excavation .
Agitate circulate and adjust the properties of the slurry to prevent the slurry from setting up in the shaft excavation .
Perform control tests using suitable apparatus on the mineral slurry to determine density viscosity and pH .
Conform to the acceptable range of values for these physical properties as shown in Table .. TABLE .

to .
to .
to Viscosity sqt sL Marsh Cone to to to to pH pH Paper or meter to to If desanding is required do not allow the sand content to exceed percent by volume at any point in the shaft excavation as determined by the American Petroleum Institute sand content test .
Determine density viscosity and pH values before and during the shaft excavation to establish a consistent working pattern .
Before placing shaft concrete use an approved slurrysampling tool to take slurry samples from the bottom and at midheight of the shaft .
Eliminate heavily contaminated slurry that has accumulated at the bottom of the shaft .
Ensure that the mineral slurry conforms to the requirements specified immediately before shaft concrete placement .
Only use polymer slurry after demonstrating to the Engineer that the stability of the hole perimeter can be maintained while advancing the excavation to its final depth by excavating a trial hole of the same diameter and depth as that of the production shafts .
Use the same polymer slurry in the trial hole as proposed for the production shafts .
If using different sizes of the shafts at the project use the same size trial hole as that of the largest diameter shaft except the depth of the trial hole need not be more than feet meters .
Only one trial hole per project is required .
Do not use the trial hole excavation for a production shaft .
After completing the trial hole excavation fill the hole with sand .
The acceptance of the polymer slurry does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility to maintain the stability of the excavation .
Polymer slurry shall conform to the manufacturers requirements. . Excavation Inspection .
Provide equipment for checking the dimensions and alignment of each shaft excavation .
Determine the dimensions and alignment .
Measure the final shaft depth after final inspection .
Immediately before placing concrete ensure that the bottom of the completed drilled shaft excavation is as clean as practical .
Remove drilling spoils that adhere to the vertical sides of the bedrock socket . .
Reinforcing Steel for Drilled Shafts .
Place the reinforcing steel cage as a unit immediately after inspection of the excavation and before placing concrete .
If not placing the concrete immediately after installing the cage the Contractor may have to remove the cage before placing the concrete to verify the integrity of the excavated area and to ensure loose material is removed from the bottom of the hole .
Tie and support the reinforcing steel so it remains within the required tolerances .
Securely tie spacers at quarter points around the cage perimeter and space at intervals not to exceed feet .
m along the length of the cage .
If the size of the longitudinal reinforcing steel equals or exceeds inch mm in diameter the Contractor may increase the distance between the spacing devices to a maximum of feet m. Use spacers of adequate dimensions to ensure a minimum annular space between outside of cage and side of hole or casing of inches mm for shaft diameters up to feet .
m and inches mm for shaft diameters larger than feet .
m. The Contractor may use round plastic spacers .
Maintain the top of the reinforcing steel cage no more than inches mm above and no more than inches mm below the required position .
If the reinforcing steel cage is not maintained within tolerances make acceptable corrections and do not construct additional shafts until the method of reinforcing steel cage support has been approved .
When approved by the Engineer the Contractor need not provide the reinforcing steel for the extended length of the drilled shaft if it is determined in the field that the Contractor must drill the shaft deeper than the estimated length . .
Concrete for Drilled Shafts .
For all drilled shafts use Class QC or QC concrete for Mass Concretedrilled shaft diameter over ft . m according to Item except as modified and supplemented as follows .
The required slump is inch mm .
Achieve the additional slump over inches mm by using chemical admixtures conforming to .
Type F or G. The maximum watercement ratio shall not exceed ..
If placing concrete under water add percent more cement to the concrete mix .
If placing concrete using a tremie further increase the slump to inch mm by using chemical admixtures .
For wet method construction place concrete in one continuous operation from bottom to top of the shaft .
After the concrete has reached the top of the drilled shaft continue pumping and remove all contaminated concrete until acceptable quality concrete is evident at the top of the shaft .
Do not vibrate concrete with a vibrator .
Carefully remove the casing so that the reinforcing steel cage is not deformed by the force of the downward flowing concrete .
Do not place concrete in any drilled shaft excavation without acceptance from the Engineer .
Inspect the drilled shaft excavation immediately before placing the concrete .
Provide a light powerful enough to thoroughly inspect the reinforcing steel cage the sides and the bottom of the drilled shaft .
The inspection for the wet construction method consists of only probing and measuring .
If the elevation of the top of the shaft is below ground at the time of concrete placement use a casing to prevent caving of materials into fresh concrete. . Free Fall Concrete Placement .
The Contractor may place the concrete in a dry drilled shaft excavation using the free fall method provided the concrete falls to its final position through air without striking the sides of the hole the reinforcing steel cage or any other obstruction .
Use a centering drop chute at least feet m long with the free fall method .
Unless shown on the plans there is no limit to the height of free fall .
If the concrete placement causes the shaft excavation to cave or slough or if the concrete strikes the rebar cage or sidewall reduce the height of free fall or the rate of concrete flow into the excavation or both .
If the Engineer determines that dewatering is not practical or placement by free fall method can not be accomplished place the concrete using a tremie or a concrete pump. . Tremie .
The Contractor may use a gravity tremie to place concrete placement instead of a concrete pump in either wet or dry holes .
For uncased wet holes maintain the drilled shaft excavation full of slurry or water to such a depth that water does not flow into the shaft excavation at any time .
To place concrete use tremies consisting of a tube of sufficient length weight and diameter to discharge concrete at the shaft base elevation .
If the tremie contains aluminum parts do not allow these parts to contact the concrete .
Use tremies with an inside diameter of at least inches mm .
Ensure that the inside and outside surfaces of the tremie are clean and smooth to allow both flow of concrete and unimpeded withdrawal during concreting .
Use tremies with a wall thickness adequate to prevent crimping or sharp bends that restrict concrete placement .
For concrete placement use watertight tremies .
Do not begin underwater placement until the tremie is placed to the shaft bottom elevation .
Use valves bottom plates or plugs so concrete discharge can begin within one tremie diameter of the base .
Either remove plugs from the excavation or use plugs of an Engineer approved material that does not cause a defect in the shaft if not removed .
Construct the discharge end of the tremie to allow the free radial flow of concrete during placement operations .
Immerse the tremie discharge end at least feet m in concrete at all times after starting the flow of concrete .
If the tremie line orifice is removed from the fluid concrete column during the concrete pour and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level consider the drilled shaft defective . .
Pumped Concrete .
Pump concrete into either wet or dry holes .
For uncased wet holes maintain the drilled shaft excavation full of slurry or water to such a depth that water does not flow into the shaft excavation at any time .
Use concrete pump pipe at least inches mm in diameter and constructed with watertight joints .
Arrange the concrete pump equipment so no vibrations result that might damage fresh concrete .
Arrange pipes carrying concrete from the pump to the shaft with a minimum number of bends .
Anchor the pipe used to convey the concrete to the bottom of the drilled shaft excavation to the steel casing or another suitable stationary object to prevent the pipe from undulating during the initial placement of the concrete .
Do not begin placing concrete until the pump line orifice is at the shaft base elevation .
Do not use aluminum pipe as a conveyance for the concrete .
Pump an adequate quantity of grout mortar or concrete without coarse aggregate through the equipment ahead of the specification concrete to provide lubrication to the pumping system .
Do not place the concrete used for lubrication in the shaft .
The lubrication process will not be repeated as long as the pumping operations are continuous .
Operate the pump so a continuous stream of concrete without air pockets is produced .
To prevent the contamination of the concrete placed initially at the bottom of the shaft seal the outlet end of the pumping pipe with a diaphragm or plug that is flushed out when the hydrostatic pressure from the column of concrete exceeds that of the water in the shaft .
Control the initial rate of concrete placement so not to lift or displace the cage of reinforcing steel .
Use a watertight conveying system and leave the outlet end well below the top of the freshly placed concrete .
The preferred concrete placement procedure is to maintain the outlet end of the pumping system at approximately feet m below the top of the fresh concrete .
When the concrete reaches the top of the drilled shaft column remove all laitance .
If the concrete pump line orifice is removed from the fluid concrete column during the concrete pour and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level the drilled shaft shall be considered defective. . Construction Tolerances .
For shafts supporting single columns position the drilled shaft within inches mm of the plan location in the horizontal plane at the plan elevation for the top of the shaft .
For shafts supporting footings position the center within inches mm of the plan location .
Do not allow the vertical alignment of the shaft to vary from the required alignment by more than inch per foot mmm of depth .
Construct the supported elements at the plan location .
Perform all corrections required to construct the supported elements . .
Inspection Records .
Provide all necessary equipment and labor needed to obtain measurements for completing the Inspection Records .
Obtain measurements before placing concrete . .
Method of Measurement .
The Department will measure Drilled Shafts by the number of feet meters measured along the axis of the drilled shaft from the required bottom elevation of the shaft to the proposed top plan elevation .
The Department will not measure the length of reinforcing steel projecting from the drilled shaft into the pier column or the footing supported on Drilled Shafts as shown on the plans .
If the drilled shaft extends into the bedrock The Department will divide the total length of each drilled shaft into two segments .
The length of the lower segment is the length of the bedrock socket and the length of the upper segment is the length of the drilled shaft above the bedrock socket .
If a steel casing extending down to bedrock is used the Department will measure the bedrock socket from the bottom of the casing to the bottom of the drilled bedrock excavation .

General .
According to AASHTO M Table except as follows .
Ensure PG M PG M PG M and PG meet the requirements of Table .. An independent laboratory will not be owned or operated in whole or part by the binder supplier Contractor or affiliates of either .
Materials and Manufacture .
Replace the requirements of AASHTO M Table Section Materials and Manufacture Section with the following .
Supply PG Binder from the refining of crude petroleum or combination of asphalt binders from the refining of crude petroleum or asphalt binders and suitable liquid from the refining of crude petroleum and possible organic modifiers for performance enhancement .
Material from the crude refining stream is considered neat .
Liquid from crude refining may be used for adjustments but do not used liquid from crude refining for the purpose of substitution of crude refined asphalt binder in a PG Binder .
In the event of a failure investigation where asphalt binders exhibit unusual properties a supplier may be requested by OMM to supply information about the makeup of a PG Binder .
Failure to cooperate will mean removal from Supplement certification. . A modifier may be any approved material of suitable manufacture that is proven compatible with asphalt binder does not separate appreciably in routine storage and that is dissolved or reacted in asphalt binder to improve its performance .
Performance enhancement is defined as a decrease in the temperature susceptibility of the asphalt binder while maintaining or improving desirable properties in a neat asphalt binder such as coat ability adhesiveness and cohesiveness .
Unless otherwise noted limit modifiers to no more than .
percent by PG Binder weight . .
The use of previously used materials in a PG Binder must be approved by OMM .
Since no standard test procedures exist for reprocessed materials and original tests were not developed with the use of such materials in mind appropriate test methods may be chosen by OMM for review .
OMM approval does not relieve the binder supplier from full responsibility for content and use of any previously used material in a PG Binder nor guarantee suitable performance enhancement as defined above .
The detected presence in a PG Binder sample of any unapproved previously used material will mean immediate removal from Supplement certification .
Limit approved previously used materials to .
percent by PG Binder weight maximum and provide a written certification to OMM stating the exact percent used the source and any brand or trade names .
Approved previously used materials are only allowed to be used to produce PG and PG and suppliers must get recertified per Supplement for these PG grades . .
Ensure the PG Binder is homogeneous free from water and deleterious materials and does not foam when heated to ºF ºC .
Prove the asphalt binder before modification or after modification if liquid modifier used is fully compatible with a negative result by means of the Spot Test per AASHTO T using standard naphtha solvent .
If standard naphtha shows a positive result a retest using reagent grade percent Xylene percent Heptane volume may be used . .
Ensure the PG Binder is at least .
percent soluble as determined by AASHTO T or ASTM D. Ensure any insoluble component is free of fibers or discrete particles more than µm . .
Ensure flash point is ºF ºC minimum .
Ensure mass change on RTFO of the final PG Binder grade is .
percent maximum . .
Ensure that PG has a Penetration AASHTO T of no more than . .
Direct Tension testing is not required unless otherwise required in this specification .
Requirements for PG Modified Binder .
Furnish PG Modified Binder according to the requirements of Table .
by modifying a nonoxidized nonair blown neat asphalt binder by using a styrene butadiene latex rubber compound SBR polymer a styrene butadiene styrene polymer block copolymer SB SBS polymer an ethylene nbutyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate copolymer Elvaloy as specified or Ground Tire Rubber GTR according to Supplemental Specification .
For SB SBS products the polymer supplier will certify to the refiner and Contractor that the polymer used meets a minimum percent by weight butadiene content .
Perform SB SBS Elvaloy or GTR modification prior to shipment to the asphalt concrete mixing plant preblend .
Perform SBR modification at the asphalt concrete mixing plant postblend or prior to shipment to the asphalt concrete mixing plant preblend where allowed by specification .
Polyphosphoric acid PPA is allowed in PG binders as follows .
PPA is a polymer of orthophosphoric acid .
When using PPA ensure all the applicable requirements of the required PG binder in Table .
are met .
Ensure PPA does not contain water .
To retain Supplement certification suppliers of PPA modified asphalt will provide a written certification to OMM that the amount of PPA used is less than .
by weight of neat binder .
Suppliers of PPA can have their Supplement certification removed for not following the above PPA requirements .
For each project the PG Modified Binder supplier will give the Contractor a handling guide specifying temperature circulation shelf life and other requirements for assuring the PG Modified Binder will perform as desired .
Give this handling guide to the Monitoring Team and place a copy in the plant control room and plant laboratory .
If PG Modified Binder is retained at the asphalt concrete mixing plant for more than two weeks before use or beyond the supplier recommended shelf life whichever is less a top and bottom sample test material property difference between samples taken from the top and bottom of the storage tank will be performed by OMM on samples retrieved by the Contractor at the Laboratorys direction .
Do not use material on hand until approved .
