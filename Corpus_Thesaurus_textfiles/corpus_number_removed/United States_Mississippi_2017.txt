SECTION MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT .Measurement of Quantities .
The measurement and determination of quantities for each pay item will be made in general as prescribed hereinafter and specifically as set out under Method of Measurement and Basis of Payment for each respective pay item .
Actual authorized quantities of work complete and accepted under the Contract will be Section Section measured by the Engineer according to United States standard measures and in accordance with well recognized engineering practices .
Unauthorized wastage of material will be deducted and only quantities actually incorporated in the completed work or ordered to be wasted will be included in the final estimate .
A station when used as a definition or term of measurement will be linear feet .
Unless otherwise specified longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made horizontally and no deductions will be made for individual fixtures having an area of nine square feet or less .
Unless otherwise specified transverse measurements for area computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or ordered by the Engineer .
Where the area unit for measurement and payment is specified for erosion control items the measurements will be taken on the slope of the ground to compute the actual surface area for payment .
Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as altered to fit field conditions .
All items that are measured by the linear foot such as pipe culverts guardrail underdrains etc .
will be measured as specified under the Method of Measurement for the item unless otherwise shown on the plans .
No payment will be made for unauthorized excavation .
Excavation or embankment performed beyond the required neat lines or slope stakes will not be measured for payment unless within tolerances specified or otherwise provided .
In computing volumes of excavation and embankment the average end area method will be used unless otherwise specified .
The thickness of plates and galvanized sheets used in the manufacture of corrugated metal pipe metal plate pipe culverts and arches and metal cribbing will be specified and measured in decimal fractions of inches as shown in AASHTO M or M . When size number is used in the measurement of wire it will mean the size number specified in AASHTO M . The term ton will mean the short ton consisting of pounds avoirdupois .

However car weights will not be acceptable for material to be used in mixing plants .
Trucks used to haul material being paid for by weight shall be weighed empty daily at such time as the Engineer directs and each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark .
Timber except timber piling will be measured by the thousand feet board measure MBM actually incorporated in the structure .
Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the length of each piece .
Section Section When a complete structure or structural unit in effect lump sum work is specified as the unit of measurement the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories .
Volumes of materials computed in cubic yards by the average end area method are designated as Final Measure FM or Final Measure Embankment FME .
Volumes of materials designated for measurement loose in the vehicle are designated as Loose Vehicle Measure LVM .
Volumetric measurement of excavation embankment granular materials or similar materials in cubic yards will be made by the methods designated on the plans or in the proposal .
For justifiable reasons such as impracticability of measurement of volumes usually small by the designated method the Engineer may order measurement by another method as follows a Volumes designated for payment by FM may be measured LVM and converted to Contract measurement by multiplying the loose measure by percent .
b Volumes designated for payment by LVM may be measured in its original position by the average end area method and multiply the FM measure by percent .
c Volumes designated for payment by FME may be measured in its original position by the average end area method and multiply the FM measure by percent .
d Small volumes of surplus excess excavation or other small volumes of excavation that are impractical to measure by the average end area method but are designated to be measured by FME may be measured LVM and multiply the loose measure by percent .
When the Engineer orders the use of a conversion factor for converting a unit of measure the ordered method of measurement shall be deemed acceptable to all parties and shall be final .
When the average end area method is indicated other threedimensional measurements of the prismoid occupied by the material in its natural position before removal or in its final position in the embankment may be used .
When requested by the Contractor material specified to be measured by the cubic yard or ton may be converted to the other measure as appropriate .
Factors for this conversion will be determined by the District Materials Engineer and agreed to by the Contractor .
The conversion of the materials along with the conversion factor will be incorporated into the Contract by Supplemental Agreement .
The Supplemental Agreement must be executed before such method of measurement is used .
All materials measured by the cubic yard LVM shall be hauled in approved vehicles and verified at the point of delivery .
Vehicles may be of any size or type acceptable to the Engineer provided the body is of such shape that the capacity may be readily and accurately determined to the whole cubic yard in accordance with Department SOP .
Unless all vehicles on the project are of uniform capacity each vehicle must be plainly labeled to indicate its measured capacity .
Where loose vehicle measurement LVM is used the capacity will be computed to the nearest onetenth cubic yard and paid to the whole cubic yard .
Measurements greater than or equal to ninetenths of a cubic yard will Section Section be rounded to the next highest number .
Measurements less than ninetenths of a cubic yard will not be rounded to the next highest number .
Example A vehicle measurement of .
cubic yards will be classified as a cubic yard vehicle .
A vehicle measurement of .
cubic yards will be classified as a cubic yard vehicle .
All vehicles shall be legibly numbered for identification .
The vehicles shall be loaded to ensure a water level load when they arrive at the point of delivery .
Loads hauled in unapproved vehicles and loads of a quantity less than the measured quantity for the hauling vehicle will be subject to rejection .
Bituminous materials will be measured by the gallon or ton .
Volumes will be measured at F or corrected to the volume at F using tables in Department SOP .

inch but not more than .
inch from the plan thickness an adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection .. will be paid for the area represented by these cores .
In calculating the average thickness of the pavement measurements which are in excess of the specified thickness by more than .
inch will be considered as the specified thickness plus .
inch and measurements which are less than the specified thickness by more than .
inch excluding exploratory cores will be considered as the specified thickness minus .
inch in the average .
When the measured thickness of a core is less than the plan thickness by more than .
inch the actual thickness of the pavement in this area will be determined by taking exploratory cores at not less than foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction from the affected location until in each direction a core is found which is not deficient by more than .
inch .
Areas found deficient in thickness by more than .
inch will be evaluated by the Engineer and if in the judgment of the Engineer the deficient areas warrant removal they shall be removed and replaced with pavement of the thickness shown on the plans without cost to the Department .

Cargille Laboratories Inc. Cedar Grove NJ PROCEDURE a Using the mortar and pestle crush a few representative beads and place a few of these crushed particles on a microscope slide .
b Place a drop of a refractive index liquid with an index as close to that of the glass as can be estimated on the crushed bead particles .
c Cover the slide with a microscope slide cover and view the crushed particles by transmitted light normal to the slide surface by illumination from the bottom .
d Adjust the microscope mirror to allow a minimum light intensity for viewing .
This is important when sodium light is not used .
e Bring a relatively flat and transparent particle into focus .
f By slightly raising and lowering the microscope tube look for one or both of the following .
Becke Line This light line will appear to move either into the particle or away from it .
In general when the microscope tube is raised the line will move toward the material of higher refractive index .
When the microscope tube is lowered the line will move toward the material of lower index . .
Variation in Particle Brightness When raising the microscope tube from sharp focus the particle will appear to get brighter or darker than the Section Section surrounding field .
If it becomes brighter the glass has a higher refractive index than the liquid .
If it becomes darker the glass has a lower refractive index than the liquid .
In both cases the opposite will be true when the microscope tube is lowered .
g This test can be used to confirm that the beads are above or below a specified index .
It can also be used to give an accurate determination of the index ..
This is done by using several refractive index liquids until a match or near match of indices occurs .
The index of the glass will equal that of the liquid when no Becke line and no variation in bead brightness can be observed .
Acid Resistance .
The beads shall show resistance to corrosion of their surface after exposure to a solution by weight of sulfuric acid .

.. Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders .
Steels that are manufactured to a yield point greater than psi shall not be heat curved .
Type of Heating .
Beams and girders may be curved by either continuous or Vtype heating as approved by the Engineer .
For the continuous method a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flange shall be heated simultaneously .
The strip shall be of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
For the Vtype heating the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in truncated triangular or wedgeshaped areas having their bases along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
The spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the required curvature and heating shall progress along the top and bottom flange at approximately the same rate .
For the Vtype heating the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface shall terminate just before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached .
To avoid unnecessary web distortion special care shall be taken when heating the inside flange surface so the heat is not applied directly to the web .
When the radius of curvature is feet or more the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than feet the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend past the web for a distance equal to of the flange or three inches whichever is less .
The truncated triangular pattern shall have an included angle of approximately to degrees but the base of the triangle shall not exceed inches .
Variations in the patterns prescribed above may be made with the approval of the Engineer .
For both types of heating the flange edges to be heated are those that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .
Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is only mandatory when the flange thickness is ¼ inches or greater in which case the two surfaces shall be heated concurrently .
The maximum temperatures shall be as prescribed below .
Temperature .
The heatcurving operation shall be conducted in such a manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed F as measured by temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means .
The girder shall not be artificially cooled until after naturally cooling to F. The method of artificial cooling is subject to the approval of the Engineer .
Position for Heating .
The girder may be heat curved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
When curved in the vertical position the girder shall be braced or supported in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heat curving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
When curved in the horizontal position the girder must be supported near its ends and at intermediate points if required to obtain a uniform curvature .
The bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder must not exceed the usual allowable design stress .
When the girder is positioned horizontally for heating intermediate safety catch blocks must be maintained at the midlength of the girder within two inches of the flanges Section Section at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
Sequence of Operations .
The girder shall be heat curved in the fabrication shop before it is painted .
The heat curving operation may be conducted either before or after all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed .
However unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage connection plates and bearing stiffeners shall be located and attached after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required they shall be heat curved or oxygen cut separately and then welded to the curved girder .
When cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams they may be attached before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than ½ inches and the radius of curvature is greater than feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates the beams must be heatcurved before the cover plates are attached .
Cover plates must be either heat curved or oxygen cut separately and then welded to the curved beam .
Camber .
Girders shall be cambered before heat curving .
Camber for rolled beams may be obtained by heat cambering methods approved by the Engineer .
For plate girders the web shall be cut to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat curving .
The heatcurving process may tend to change the vertical camber present before heating .
This effect will be most pronounced when the top and bottom flanges are of unequal widths on a given transverse cross section .
However subject to the approval of the Engineer moderate deviations from specified camber may be corrected by a carefully supervised application of heat .
Measurement of Curvature and Camber .
Horizontal curvature and vertical camber shall not be measured for final acceptance before all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the girder in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by using other suitable means .
Camber shall be checked by adequate means .
