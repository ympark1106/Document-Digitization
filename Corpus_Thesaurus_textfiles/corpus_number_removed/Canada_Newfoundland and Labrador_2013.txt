General The Contractor Performance Evaluation System is a process designed to maintain an acceptable level of performance from Contractors carrying out work for the Department of Transportation and Works hereafter the Department .
It will also provide a means to identify contractors with acceptable performance records and to provide a means to identify and deal with contractors with unsatisfactory or unacceptable performance records .
A record of the performance of Contractors will be maintained to identify the following a Those Contractors who by virtue of satisfactory performance as defined herein will continue to be eligible to submit tenders for work with the Department .
b Those Contractors who by virtue of unacceptable performance as defined herein may be subject to having their bidding privileges suspended by the Department for a period of time determined by the Department based on a review and an evaluation of their contract work on a particular project .
c Those Contractors who by virtue of unsatisfactory performance as defined herein who may have their bidding privileges suspended based on an evaluation of their contract work on a particular project and other projects completed for the Department .
During the execution of the work of the contract before the issuance of a Final Completion Certificate under the contract and during or related to the execution of warranty work related to GC of the contract the Contractor is to be notified immediately if the work is not proceeding or being completed in a satisfactory manner .
This notification in the case of contract work before the issuance of a Final Completion certificate would normally be confirmed in job meeting records or correspondence to the Contractor .
In the case of warranty related work required under GC notification would normally be confirmed by correspondence to the Contractor .
In this respect the Contractor Performance Evaluation System is not intended to interfere with or substitute for the normal written communication that a Resident Engineer would initiate when confronted with unsatisfactory performance .
GOVERNMENT OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR Department of Transportation and Works Highway Design Division March .
Performance Rating Methodology The performance of a Contractor on a contract will be conducted by the Regional Engineer in two parts in accordance with the methodology laid out in the Forms attached hereto as Form A being the Contractor Performance Evaluation Report Part I Contract Work Other Than Warranty Work and as Form B being the Contractor Performance Evaluation Report Part II Warranty Work Under The Contract .
Unacceptable performance as defined herein on a single project may result in the suspension of bidding privileges for a period of time to be determined by the Department .
Unsatisfactory performance as defined herein on a particular project subject to a review of Contractor performance on other projects for the Department may result in the suspension of bidding privileges for a period of time to be determined by the Department .
The Performance Rating Methodology under each of these two parts of the Contractor Performance Evaluation System is now discussed in turn .
Performance Rating Methodology for Contractors Work Other Than Warranty Work The Contractors performance in this category will be evaluated on a points rating system relative to quality of work performed timeliness in completing work and managementadministration of contractswork .
This evaluation will be completed within thirty days of the earlier of the issuance of a Final Completion Certificate for the project or the abandonment of the work by the Contractor or the termination of the work of the Contractor under the contract by the Department .
a Quality of Work Performed points The quality of the Contractors work in conformance with contract documents and industry standards will form the basis for points awarded in this category .
Where the Contractors performance is in conformity with the contract documents and industry standards the Contractors work will be defined to be Acceptable and the Contractor will receive a score of fifty points on From A .
Where the Contractors performance is not in conformity with the contract documents and industry standards the Contractors work will be defined to be Unacceptable and the Contractor will receive a score of zero points on Form A. b Timeliness in Completing Work points Conformance to the specified schedule in the contract in relation to circumstances within the Contractors control will form the basis of points awarded in this category .
Time shall be of the essence in all Department contracts with Contractors .
The normal risks associated with contracting are not to be considered as causes beyond the Contractors control .
Delays caused by subContractors are the prime Contractors responsibility .
However if the prime Contractor has taken all possible action to expedite a subContractors work the effectiveness of this effort shall be considered by the Department when evaluating the Contractors performance .
Timeliness deals with the Contractors performance from the date of award to the date of substantial completion .
The Contractors performance on post completion activities other than warranty work under the contract such as clean up and addressing identified deficiencies in the work should be taken into account under the Management rating .
Where the Contractor completes the work on time in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the Contractor and accepted by the Department pursuant to the contract documents March the Contractors work will be defined to be On Time and the Contractor shall receive a score of twenty five points on Form A .
Where the Contractor completes the work during the same fiscal year that the work was scheduled to be completed in but not in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the Contractor and accepted by the Department pursuant to the contract documents the Contractors work will be defined to be Late and the Contractor shall receive a score of fifteen points on Form A .
Where the Contractor completes the work during the following or a subsequent fiscal year other than the fiscal year that the work was scheduled to be completed in not in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the Contractor and accepted by the Department pursuant to the contract documents the Contractors work will be defined to be Very Late and the Contractor shall receive a score of zero points on Form A .

Slight Segregation Area where the matrix is in place between the stones but there is slightly more stone in comparison with the surrounding acceptable mix .
Slight segregation will normally be left in place without price adjustment .
The severity of segregation can be determined through a number of test methods as specified by the Engineer .
Medium Segregation Area has significantly more stone than the surrounding acceptable mat and usually exhibits some lack of surface matrix .
Medium segregation in surfacecourses will be subject to a penalty of m for the area in question but for basecourses will normally be left in place with no price reduction .
However any areas of medium segregation that deteriorate prior to being overlaid by another pavement course must be repaired at the Contractors cost .
Severe segregation Area appears very stony with stone against stone and little or no matrix .
All areas of severe segregation in any pavement course will require removal and repair across the full lane width .
Defects as determined by the Engineer which occur in the finished surface of any pavement course during the two year warranty period resulting from poor workmanship shall be repaired by the Contractor .
The Contractors method of repair shall be approved by the Engineer and performed according to specifications .
.. Pavement Smoothness Pavement Smoothness Measurement The smoothness of the finished surface of the top lift of the pavement structure shall be determined after final rolling of the surface to be tested .
Normally the outer wheel paths of all lanes will be tested in m sections or lots .
Other wheel paths may also be tested in addition to or as a substitution for the outer wheel path as directed by the Engineer .
The profile measurement will normally be taken using a Class inertial laser profiler which will measure the profile in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and ASTM E Standard Test Method for Measuring the Longitudinal Profile of Traveled Surfaces with an Accelerometer Established Inertial Profiling Reference .
The resulting measurements will be compiled to produce a Profile Index PI .
This determination of smoothness will be made by the Department or its representative .
The Profile Index PI for each lane is the cumulative profile reading of the outer wheel path in millimeters per m section in excess of the mm blanking band .
Profile Index Limits The surface of the profiled pavement shall conform to the following Smoothness requirements Table Smoothness Requirements Roadway Alignment Section Profile Index mm m RLU CLASSIFICATION AND ABOVE mm OR LESS INTERCHANGE RAMPS TAPERS AND HIGHWAYS OF LOWER CLASSIFICATION THAN RLU NA FORM March If the Smoothness requirements are not met the Contractor shall repair the sections or pay a price adjustment based on the Profile Index .

GENERAL Six categories of signing are distinguished with regard to location of devices relative to work sites namely Advance Warning Area Approach Area Buffer Zone Taper Work Zone and Intersecting Roads .
The work site as used in this Division is defined by the beginning of tapers buffer and the work itself. . ADVANCE WARNING AREA The advance area is the section of the roadway where motorists are first alerted about roadwork ahead .
Signing in this area may begin up to km from the approach area and ending at the TC CONSTRUCTION AHEAD sign . .
APPROACH AREA The approach area is the section of the roadway where motorists are given final warning and information on what actions to take before entering the work zone .
Signing in this area typically begins immediately following the TC CONSTRUCTION AHEAD sign and ends at the beginning of the buffer zone . .
BUFFER ZONE The buffer zone is the distance from the last sign in the approach signing to the work site. . TAPER The gradual narrowing of a lane using successive cones or markers is intended to safely guide drivers into the next lane .
The taper length is the length of the section of roadway required to achieve the closure and shall be as follows kmh or less m kmh m kmh m kmh and TCH m GOVERNMENT OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR Department of Transportation and Works Highway Design Division FORM March .
WORK ZONE The work zone is that portion of the roadway which contains the work activity workers equipment and construction materials .
Work areas may be fixed or moved as the work progresses .
The area is usually delineated by channelizing devices or in some instances shielded by barriers .
Potential hazards and conflicts will increase in the work area if The work area is close to the travel lanes A physical obstruction exists uneven pavement trucks turning etc .
Speed of traffic increases The distance the traffic is shifted gets greater or more complex .
Long term work areas in excess of hours have a greater need for delineation. . INTERSECTING ROADS Consideration shall be given to signing intersecting secondary roadways that exist within a work zone and the area reserved for the approach signage to the work zone .
As a minimum this signing shall consist of a TC Construction Ahead sign displaying an appropriate directional arrow .
See drawings and on pages and for examples of signing intersecting roads .
Additional signage on the intersecting roadway may only be considered if the last two signs in the sequence of approach signage are not apparent to motorists on the intersecting roadway .
Adjusting sign spacing may also be considered as a means of reducing sign requirements on intersecting roadways while providing pertinent information that is apparent to all motorists .
In all situations the placing of signs shall be based on a review of traffic conditions traffic volumes sight distances and sound engineering judgment . .
BASIS OF PAYMENT All costs associated with temporary condition signing to standards as outlined in this Section shall be the responsibility of the Contractor .
Cost of the signs handling installation removal asphalt reinstatement and or repair materials and labour shall be paid by the Contractor and no payment shall be considered by the Department of Works Services and Transportation .
