If a problem is noted in the plant production sampling or other process controlled by the Contractor the test result will be considered valid until production is complete .
If a problem is found with the testing or other Department process the test result will be corrected or the test redone on material from the same sample if possible .
If a non correctable testing problem is found the result will be discarded if possible another sample will be taken and the new result used in its place .
If resampling is not possible the Department may discard the test results for a sublot considered to be an outlier and recalculate the incentives and disincentives using the remaining results in the lot .

If no identifiable problem is found no corrections will be made until production is complete .
The following outlier evaluation only applies to projects with or more QA sublots .
After all production of this product is completed the Department will determine the standard deviation and mean of all the Departments test results for each property representing material produced after the initial targets were set .

After the initial load is applied and the reference marks are established individually pull the strands to the final load .
Tension each strand to the load required by the gauge reading .
The elongation measurement must be within of the load indicated by the gauge reading .
If the load indicated by gauge reading doesnt agree with the measured elongation within the required tolerance discontinue tensioning and inspect the bed for restrictions that could affect the accuracy of the applied load .
If the measurements agree three more strands may be tensioned .
If elongation measurement and gauge readings are within the required tolerance the remaining strands may be tensioned .
As some variation in the modulus of elasticity and the crosssectional area of a strand does exist the strand tensioning may be accepted if the difference between the load determined by elongation and that indicated by the gauge does not exceed .
A maximum of the total number of straight strands for any one line of casting will be accepted on this basis .

If the gauge reading is within but either or both of the load cells exceed that limit retension the strands including pre loading .
Locate and place the load cells on the strands nearest to those previously gauged .
If upon retensioning the load cells are within the tolerance no excess strand slippage has occurred and the movable anchorage has traveled the required distance the tensioning may be accepted .
If the difference between the gauge readings load cell readings and elongation measurements exceed the tolerance limit stop tensioning and correct the problem .
Lubricate the jacking ram or rams guide rods and movable anchorage rails to minimize friction and run the ram through its length of travel at least four times before tensioning the strand .
C. Tensioning Draped Strands .
Draped pretensioned strands may be tensioned by partial jacking at the stressing block and subsequent depressing or uplifting to the deflected position or by tensioning to the initial and final loads with the tendons held in EDITION PRESTRESSED CONCRETE MEMBERS the final design position using pins rollers or other devices .
Use lowfriction devices at all points of slope change of the draped strand .
When draped strands are partially tensioned in the straight condition and then depressed to the final design position determination of the final load is made as follows .
Before starting the tensioning operation place a load cell at the dead end anchorage on one of the strands to be deflected in each line of beams . .
The Inspector will select the strand to which the load cell will be placed. . Once tensioning is complete the load cell reading must be within of the final design load .
Should the load cell reading exceed the allowable tolerance use additional deflecting jacks to distribute friction and restraint at the deflection points or if necessary revise the entire method for applying the final design load within tolerances .
If the tensioning of draped strands indicates readings within the tolerances the Inspector may require load cells for occasional checks .
If tensioning of the draped strands is performed by partial tensioning and uplift or by tensioning in the draped position submit the method for approval before use .
Strand splicing using approved devices is permitted .
