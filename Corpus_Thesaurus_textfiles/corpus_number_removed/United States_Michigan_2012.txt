The Bidder made a substantial error and signing the contract would impose a substantial and unjustified hardship on the Bidder given the size and nature of the project or B .
Extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the Bidder exist in which signing the contract would impose a substantial and unjustified hardship on the Bidder given the size and nature of the project .

Annual Ring .
The growth layer produced by the tree in a single growth year including earlywood and latewood .
Bark .
The layer of a tree outside the cambian comprising the inner bark or thin inner living part phloem and the outer bark or corky layer composed of dry dead tissue .
Bird Peck .
A small hole or patch of distorted grain resulting from birds pecking through the growing cells in the tree .
Bird peck usually resembles a carpet tack with the point toward the bark and it is usually accompanied by discoloration extending for a . considerable distance along the grain and to a much lesser extent across the grain .
The discoloration produced by bird peck causes what is commonly known as mineral streak .
Boxed Heart .
The term used when the pith falls entirely within the four faces of a piece of wood anywhere in its length .
Also called boxed pith .
Check .
A lengthwise separation of the wood that usually extends across the rings of annual growth and commonly results from stresses set up in wood during seasoning .
Checks are measured as an average of the penetration perpendicular to the wide face .
Where two or more checks appear on the same face only the deepest one is measured .
Where two checks are directly opposite each other the sum of their depths is used .
Contiguous Checks .
Individual checks that are adjoining though not in contact with adjacent checks .
Crook or Sweep .
A distortion of a piece of lumber or post in which there is a deviation in a direction perpendicular to the edge from a straight line from end to end of the piece .
Decay .
The decomposition of wood substance caused by action of wood destroying fungi resulting in softening loss of strength and weight and often in change of texture and color .
Advanced or typical Decay .
The older stage of decay in which the destruction is readily recognized because the wood has become punky soft and spongy stringy ringshaked pitted or crumbly .
Decided discoloration or bleaching of the rotted wood is often apparent .
Incipient Decay .
The early stage of decay that has not proceeded far enough to soften or otherwise perceptibly impair the hardness of the wood .
It is usually accompanied by a slight discoloration or bleaching of the wood .
Defect .
Any irregularity or imperfection occurring in or on the wood that may lower its durability or strength .
Grain .
The direction size arrangement appearance or quality of the fibers in wood or lumber .
Heartwood .
The wood extending from the pith to the sapwood the cells of which no longer participate in the life processes of the tree .
Heartwood may be infiltrated with gums resins and other .
materials that usually make it darker and more decay resistant than sapwood .
Knot .
That portion of a branch or limb that has been surrounded by subsequent growth of the wood of the trunk or other portion of the tree .
As a knot appears on the sawed surface it is merely a section of the entire knot its shape depending upon the direction of the cut .
Knot diameter is measured as shown .
The least dimension is used to determine size of the knot .
Knot Cluster .
Three or more knots in a compact roughly circular group with the grain between them highly contorted .
Two or more knots laterally arranged and without contortion of the fibers between them do not constitute a knot cluster .
Loose Knot .
A knot that is not held firmly in place by growth or position and that can not be relied upon to remain in place .
Sound Knot .
A knot that is solid across its face at least as hard as the surrounding wood and shows no indication of decay .
Unsound Knot .
A knot that due to decay is softer than the surrounding wood .
Mineral Streak .
An olive to greenishblack or brown discoloration of undetermined cause in hardwoods particularly hard maples commonly associated with bird pecks and other injuries occurs in streaks usually containing accumulations of mineral matter .
Peeling clean .
The removal of all outer bark and at least percent of the inner bark distributed over the surface of the post pile or block .
Pith .
The small soft core occurring in the structural center of a tree trunk branch twig or log .
Plugged Hole .
Any opening or defect which has been filled or repaired through the use of wooden plugs plastic wood or other methods .
Holes resulting from the taking of test cores by an increment borer to check penetration or retention of preservative and filled with tightfitting pressure treated plugs are not considered as plugged holes for rejection purposes .
Sapwood .
The living wood of pale color near the outside of the log .
Under most conditions the sapwood is more susceptible to decay than heartwood .
Shake .
A separation along the grain the greater part of which occurs between the rings of annual growth .
Shakes are .
measured at the ends of pieces between lines parallel with the two faces that give the least dimension .
Slope of Grain .
Slope of grain is the deviation of the wood fiber from a line parallel to the edges of a piece .
The deviation is expressed as a ratio such as a slope of grain of one in eight .
Generally slope of grain is measured over sufficient length and area to be representative of the general slope of the fibers disregarding local variations .
Split .
A lengthwise separation of the wood extending through the piece from one surface to an opposite or to an adjoining surface due to the tearing apart of wood cells .
Splits are measured as the penetration of a split from the end of the piece and parallel to edges of the piece .
Twist .
A distortion caused by the turning or winding of the edges of a board so the four corners of any face are no longer in the same plane .
Unsightly Gaps .
The term as used in these specifications is interpreted as being any gap or opening that is more than ⅜ inch at its maximum width and more than inches long .
Wane .
Bark or lack of wood from any cause on edge or corner of piece .
