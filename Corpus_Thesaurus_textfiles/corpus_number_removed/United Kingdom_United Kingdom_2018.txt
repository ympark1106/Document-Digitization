The Contractor shall in his choice of permitted materials for subbases and bases have regard to the nature of those materials and of the subgrade or any capping and the need to protect them from deterioration due to the ingress of water the adverse effects of weather and the use of constructional plant .
The Contractor shall programme the laying and compaction of the subbase and the subsequent pavement courses and take such other steps as may be considered necessary to afford protection to the base subbase and subgrade .
Horizontal Alignments Surface Levels and Surface Regularity of Pavement Courses Horizontal Alignments Horizontal alignments shall be determined from one edge of the pavement surface as described in contract specific Appendix .
The edge of the pavement as constructed and all other parallel alignments shall be correct within a tolerance of mm therefrom except for kerbs and channel blocks which shall be laid with a smooth alignment within a tolerance of mm .
Longitudinal road markings lateral tolerance shall be in accordance with subClause ..
Surface Levels of Pavement Courses The design levels of pavement courses shall be calculated from the vertical profile crossfalls and the pavement course thicknesses described in contract specific Appendix .

TABLE Tolerances in Surface Levels of Pavement Courses Road surfaces general adjacent to a surface water channel mm mm Binder course mm Base mm Subbase under concrete pavement surface slabs laid full thickness in one operation by machines with surface compaction mm Subbases other than above mm Where a surface water channel is laid before the adjacent road pavement layer the top of that layer measured from the top of the adjacent edge of the surface water channel shall be to the tolerances given in Table .
Notwithstanding the tolerances permitted in surface levels of pavement courses the cumulative tolerance shall not result in a reduction in thickness of the pavement excluding the subbase by more than mm from the specified thickness nor a reduction in the thickness of the bituminous surface course by more than mm from that specified .
Amendment February Volume Series Specification for Highway Works Road Pavements General For checking compliance with subClause of this Clause measurements of the surface levels of all courses will be taken on a grid of points located as described in contract specific Appendix .

For the final road surface the tolerance given in Table shall apply to any point on that surface .
Surface Regularity The longitudinal regularity of the surfaces of surface courses binder courses and concrete slabs shall be such that the number of surface irregularities is within the relevant limits stated in Table .
An irregularity is a variation of not less than mm or not less mm of the profile of the road surface as measured by the rolling straightedge set at mm or mm as appropriate or equivalent apparatus capable of measuring irregularities within the same magnitudes over a m length .

ii Sawcut and crack and seat of jointed reinforced concrete pavements in accordance with Clause .
The Contractor shall produce the FWD deflection measurements to be used in this Clause in accordance with Clause for crack and seat or Clause for sawcut crack and seat .
The effective stiffness modulus of the fractured concrete together with that of the foundation shall be derived from the backanalysis of FWD deflection bowl measurements by means of a recognised analysis package .
Highways England recognises the MODULUSHA computer program any alternative package proposed must be proven to provide the same output values as MODULUSHA .
MODULUSHA or an approved equivalent shall be used for all backanalysis of FWD measurements performed in accordance with Clause for crack and seat or Clause for sawcut crack and seat .
Detailed instructions for the use of this program are contained in its accompanying MODULUSHA User Guide .
The backanalysis procedure to be used utilises a twolayer model and therefore only the thickness of the bound layers is required .
The unbound layers are modelled as a single layer of infinite depth .
Thickness information for the bound layers is obtained from core samples obtained from the assessment of the cracking operations in accordance with Clause or Clause and may be supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar measurements when required by contract specific Appendix for crack and seat or contract specific Appendix for sawcut crack and seat .
The pavement deflection data to be backanalysed shall be divided into uniform sections with similar total thicknesses of hydraulically bound material for the purposes of backanalysis .
The mean total thickness of hydraulically bound material present shall be calculated for each section .
The measured boundlayer thicknesses within a uniform section should lie within per cent of the boundlayer thickness used for that section .
The Overseeing Organisation may instruct any variation required in the method and pattern of cracking or subsequently confirm or otherwise the suitability of the proposed thickness of overlay required as a result of the effective stiffness modulus of the fractured hydraulically bound layer or layers determined from FWD measurements .
Following submission of the electronic tables and graphs produced in accordance with subClauses and of this Clause the Contractor shall allow the period of time set out in contract specific Appendix for the Overseeing Organisation to carry out his assessment and interpretation of the results .

Asphalt Binders BindersusedtomanufacturehotmixedasphaltasphaltbindersarefirstsubjectedtoaShortterm Ageing Test to simulate the effects of manufacture transport and laying .
In this respect the test described in this Clause has been shown to be equivalent to BS EN .
The binder is continually stirred by rotating stainless steelscrewsinsamplecanstoobtainahomogeneoussampletheprocedurealsobenefitsfromafasteroxidation rate rapid ageing because of the increased exposure to the jetted air stream and therefore a shorter test duration .
The binder samples are then aged at a lower temperature and samples removed at intervals and tested to obtain an AgeingProfile.Thisisparticularlyusefulforasphaltbecausedifferentairvoidcontentsandbindercontentsina road pavement result in different ageing rates .
The Longterm Aged binder sample where the characteristics are equivalent to those obtained after hours using the Pressure Ageing Vessel PAV Test is obtained after hours therefore the test may be carried out in one day .
PAV is detailed in BS EN .
Binders used for manufacturing Warm Asphalt are mixed at much lower temperatures than for hot mixed asphalt and they do not need the same high temperature protocol for Shortterm Ageing this part of the procedure is therefore amended for these binders .
All the ageing is done at the lower temperature .
Bituminous Emulsion Binders BitumenandpolymermodifiedbituminousemulsionsarefirstsubjectedtoaRapidRecoveryTest which removes any water phase and volatile oils to produce a Recovered Binder .
The Recovered Binder has similar properties to that produced from other evaporative tests but is achieved over a shorter period and the Volume Series Specification for Highway Works Road Pavements Bituminous Bound Materials Amendment May use of nitrogen replacing air reduces risks associated with volatile oils in the oven .
The Recovered Binder in rheological terms is equivalent to that recovered using BS EN .
TheAgeingProfileisprovidedbycontinuingtheageingoftheRecoveredBinderintheMRTFOatahigher temperaturereplacingthenitrogengaswithairandremovingsamplesafterspecifiedperiodsfortesting.A Stabilised Binder equivalent in rheological terms to that produced using BS EN may be obtained from theAgeingProfilePlotforaparticularemulsion.Fluxedandvegetalfluxedbinderswherevolatileoilsarethought to be present may also be tested using this protocol .
Preservatives penetration grade bitumen used as a control is subjected to Shortterm Ageing in the MRTFOT followed by an extended period at a lower temperature to simulate the ageing of the bitumen in a road pavement .
This aged bitumen control is then cooled to ambient and treated with the preservative .
Most of the volatile oils are then removed by conditioning the samples in the MRTFOT using a nitrogen blanket .
The aged bitumen treated by preservative is then subjected to further ageing with the MRTFOT .
The properties of the aged bitumen after action ofthepreservativeareassessedbyanAgeingProfileusingrheologyandcomparedwiththeAgeingProfileof the control bitumen .
