WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DIVISION OF HIGHWAYS Edition STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS ROADS AND BRIDGES Electronic copies of this book can be obtained via the Internet at www.Transportation.wv.gov TAKE ME HOME COUNTRY ROADS Long before there was a State of West Virginia or even a Colony of Virginia there were roads here .
To a greater degree than in most other states particularly those with flat topography West Virginias roads are organic in nature .
Herds of bison had carved trails that were used by prehistoric natives from the Adena and Fort Ancient cultures and later the different tribes that traversed the region such as the Shawnee Cherokee and Iroquois .
In the th century Europeans arrived and began dividing up spaces that had formerly known no boundaries .
As they moved westward from the Atlantic coast and into the Appalachian Mountains they found these bison native trails to be useful in their own migration .
Many of those same trails are still used today in the form of paved highways that evolved over the centuries .
The Great Indian War Trading Path of antiquity is now U.S. Route and the famous Midland Trail is todays U.S. Route stretching from the states eastern border with Virginia to its western border with Kentucky .
Where Native American hunters once pursued bison for sustenance we now traverse the same roads to go to the grocery store school work and all other activities .
As the American colonies became the United States it was necessary to invest in the new nations infrastructure .
President Jefferson authorized the first federal highway The National Road to be built from Cumberland Maryland to Wheeling .
Not only did this highway bring new settlers to the Ohio Valley city but it propagated the construction of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge in to allow the highway to extend to St. Louis .
At that time it was the longest bridge in the world and the first to extend over feet .
Still in use it is known today as the Father of American Bridges .
While West Virginia was a part of the Old Dominion Virginia built The Northwestern Turnpike now known as US and the StauntonParkersburg Turnpike which follows present day USUSWV .
As students of history know the western portion of the state had more than its share of gripes with the mother state especially over slavery representation taxation and overall support .
Hence President Lincolns creation of the State of West Virginia in allowed the people who inhabited the land from the mountains over to the Ohio River to be in charge of their own destiny .
The late th and early th century saw West Virginia and the rest of the nation begin to develop ideas and methodologies to improve our roadway systems .
However it wasnt until with the creation of the State Road Commission that West Virginia began road building in earnest .
Americas entry into World War I and Henry Fords mass manufacturing of affordable automobiles ramped up the need for modern highways exponentially .
The voters of West Virginia realized this need and with the passage of two Good Roads Amendments in the s dirt and macadam gave way to paved roads with great alacrity .
Steady improvements were not always possible during the Depression era as the state assumed control of all roads but generally had inadequate funds to maintain or expand the roadway system .
Although with the advent of World War II the importance of an efficient network to transport goods and services again came to the forefront .
An influx of emergency wartime funding boosted the roadbuilding efforts in West Virginia and the conception of the Interstate System foreshadowed the era to come .
In the state began construction of the West Virginia Turnpike which would propel the economy of not just the region but provide a much needed link from Midwestern markets to those in the South .
Later in the s President Eisenhower authorized the Interstate Highway Act and that vast ribbon of concrete and asphalt would eventually connect West Virginia and all of the contiguous states .
In the s the Appalachian Development Highway System was authorized to provide economic growth to the Appalachian states including West Virginia by building better traversable highways throughout the mountainous terrain .
In the decades to follow many Appalachian Corridors were constructed across the mountain state to provide its citizens a modern transportation system .
This network of highways is constructed through narrow stream valleys and over mountaintops producing amazing views and engineering accomplishments such as the iconic New River Gorge Bridge .
The s also encompassed the tragedy of the Silver Bridge collapse in Mason County .
However its legacy is not that of footnote wasted to history .
Instead it lead to the formation of the National Bridge Inspection Program which has served the nation hence .
Throughout subsequent generations the State Road Commission would evolve into the Division of Highways and become part of the Department of Transportation that oversees all forms of travel in the Mountain State .
Through its concerted efforts West Virginias interstate system was driven to completion and the Appalachian corridors vastly expanded and now endure with major works continuing to this day .
Thanks to the evolution of trails and paths and roads West Virginia has a modern system of connectivity .
A place once known as a barrier to the nations growth has become the home of the nations th largest roadway system .
More than miles and over bridges create a network that serpentines hill hollow ridge and vale .
Comprised not only of major river crossings interstates and expressways but also the many small structures and rural byways woven into the landscape are of vital importance to safety commerce and quality of life of local communities throughout the state .
Like the herds of bison that ran uninhibited in prehistory West Virginia travelers can use these roads to celebrate our motto Montani Semper Liberi Mountaineers Are Always Free A Century of

The bidding index Ib for asphalt binder will be equal to the placement index as listed on the Contract Administrations website for Fuel and Asphalt adjustments for the Wednesday prior to the first day of the month with the effective date of the index being the first day of the month .
If the Wednesday prior to the first day of the month falls on a holiday or the price is otherwise not published for that date the index will be based on the next earliest date as reported .
The placement index Ip will be the price in effect on the first of the month in which the specific adjustable material was actually placed .
Both the bidding index Ib and the placement index Ip will be based on the average of the posted prices of PG asphalt binder per tonmegagram as reported from the following sources on the Wednesday prior to the first day of each calendar month Marathon Petroleum Company LLC Catlettsburg Kentucky Marathon Petroleum Company LLC Floreffe Pennsylvania Asphalt materials Inc. Marietta Ohio NuStar Asphalt Refining Company Baltimore Maryland Associated Asphalt Martinsburg West Virginia If one of the sources listed above changes ownership andor name the posted price for that terminal will continue in use as though the ownership andor name change had not occurred .
If one of the sources used for determining either the bidding index or the placement index goes out of business any future index will be based on the average of the remaining sources .
Thus the bidding index Ib could be based on the average of five sources and the placement index Ip on the average of four sources or viceversa .
If a source that goes out of business reopens at a later date the placement index would once again be based on the average of five sources as indicated above .
The posted price for each source will be compared to the average of all sources .
If the difference between the average and the individual price is greater than of the average that individual source will be excluded from the calculation of the average price Ib or Ip and a new average will be calculated using the remaining sources .
Sources chosen for the index are required to report their posting to the Division no later than the Wednesday prior to the first day the month .
Failure to report in a timely manner may impact source approval .
The portion of the contract unit price which reflects the cost of the specified material will be adjusted for the change in accordance with the following formula Pa QACIp Ib Where Pa Price Adjustment Ip Price Index at time of placement Ib Price Index for Bidding AC Asphalt Content see Table ..

The local District Materials Section can provide a copy of the latest list .
The list is also posted on the MCST web page under the heading Approved SourceProduct Listing .
The use of nonapproved material without prior testing by MCST may result in nonpayment of the item .
CONSTRUCTION METHODS .WEATHER RESTRICTION Tack coat shall be applied only when the weather and existing surface are satisfactory to the Engineer and when the temperature of the surface is F C or above .
When the surface temperature is less than F C care must be exercised to assure that the tack coat breaks Note prior to the application of the hotmix asphalt .
Note Tack coat break is the process in which water separates from the asphalt emulsion and the color of the tack coat begins to change from brown to black .
The time required for breaking will depend on the type and grade of the emulsion the application rate the temperature of the existing pavement surface and environmental conditions .
Tack coat set refers to the final stage of the process when water has completely evaporated from the emulsion leaving a thin film of asphalt binder on the pavement .
The rate of set depends on the same conditions that control the rate of break of the emulsion .
.EQUIPMENT Equipment shall include a power broom and power blower a broom drag equipment for heating asphalt material and a selfpowered asphalt material pressure distributor .
Equipment shall also include scrapers hand brooms shovels and other equipment as may be necessary to thoroughly clean the base or surface .
Equipment for heating asphalt material to the required temperature shall consist of a retort coil so designed that steam will not be introduced into the material and shall not degradate the emulsion .
The distributor shall be so designed equipped maintained and operated that asphalt material at even heat may be applied uniformly on variable widths of surface up to ft. . m at readily determined and controlled rates from .
to .
galsy .
to .
litersm with uniform pressure and with an allowable variation from any specified rate not to exceed .
galsy .
literm .
The distributor shall also have a cabmetering system that will automatically adjust the flow of the asphalt material as the speed of the truck changes and allow the operator to adjust the rate of application from the cab of the truck .
Distributor equipment shall include a tachometer pressure gages and accurate volume measuring devices or a calibrated tank and a thermometer for measuring temperatures of tank contents .
Distributors shall be equipped with a power unit for the pump and full circulation spray bars adjustable laterally and vertically .
A manifold connection shall be provided and hand spraying equipment shall be available to cover areas and patches inaccessible to the distributor .
.PREPARING AND REPAIRING BASE OR EXISTING SURFACES No tack coat shall be applied until breaks holes depressions and other irregularities in the base or existing surface have been repaired and cured sufficiently to permit the tack coat to be placed in a uniform application .
Patching and leveling material shall be plant mixed .
Hand patching will be permitted where necessary .
.CLEANING AND SWEEPING Immediately before starting construction the existing surface shall be swept and thoroughly cleaned by the use of tools or machinery as may be required to remove all mud dirt dust and other caked or loose material foreign to the type of surface to be placed .
Cleaning shall be done to a minimum width of one foot on each side beyond the width of the surface to be placed excluding the shoulder .
.APPLICATION OF ASPHALT MATERIAL Except when required to maintain traffic the work shall be done on the full width of the section .
After the base or surface has been cleaned when called for and is in a dry condition the asphalt material shall be applied by means of a pressure distributor .
The spray bar shall be raised to a sufficient height so as to uniformly and completely coat the entire surface .
The rate of application of asphalt material shall be as recommended in .
or as determined by the Engineer .
Application temperatures of the asphalt material shall be within the range specified in Subsection for the particular material being used .
With the exception of SS and CSS grades all emulsion grades used for tack coat shall be applied without dilution .
Anionic asphalt emulsion grades SS and SSh and cationic emulsion grades CSS and CSSh may be diluted at a ratio by addition water to the emulsion .
The tack coat shall not precede the placement of the subsequent HMA course to such an extent that the treated surface will be damaged during the interim .
No patching and leveling or surface courses of any type shall be applied to the tacked surface until the asphalt material is thoroughly set see Note in Section ..
Tack coat shall not be applied over newly placed patching and leveling courses .
However to facilitate construction minor spot areas that have been tacked patched and leveled may be retacked and the quantity so used will be included for payment as part of the normal tack coat operation .
The intent of the two preceding sentences in conjunction with the next to the last paragraph of .
is to provide one tack coat application on the existing surface although two applications one over one under for minor spot patching and leveling area are permitted as indicated above and to limit payment for such operations to one application of the tack coat upon the existing surface for the entire project .
The surfaces of sidewalks curbs other structures and trees adjacent to the area being treated shall be protected in such a manner as to prevent their being spattered or marred .
Material used for such protection shall be removed and disposed of in a satisfactory manner .
The distributor shall not be cleaned or discharged win the rightofway into borrow pits or so as to pollute or block water courses .
.APPLICATION OF COVER AGGREGATE Any tack coat material applied in excess of the requirements shall be removed or covered with a blotter course of dry sand or stone chips as directed by the Engineer .
.JOINTS Longitudinal joints shall be treated using an application rate that will thoroughly coat the vertical face without excessive runoff .PROTECTION OF THE PAVEMENT AND TRAFFIC CONTROL The Contractor shall be responsible for the protection of the surface against damage by their equipment and personnel .
Traffic shall not be permitted on any part of the work under construction until the treatment has cured sufficiently to prevent raveling or picking up under traffic .
The applicable provisions of shall apply for regulating traffic .
.QUANTITIES OF MATERIALS The application rates referenced in Table .
shall be used as guide to assure the proper amount of asphalt is distributed over the pavement surface under various pavement conditions .
The undiluted application rate refers to the unmodified emulsion that meets all standard specifications of the specified grade .
When an SS or CSS grade emulsion is diluted with water at the allowable ratio the residual asphalt content the amount of asphalt remaining on the pavement surface after all water has evaporated from the emulsion will be cut in half .
Therefore the distribution rate must be doubled in order to obtain the same residual asphalt application as the undiluted emulsion .
Unless otherwise specified on the Plans the recommended application rates for undiluted and diluted asphalt tack coat shall be as specified in Table ..
These rates are provided for guidance and may be adjusted as directed by the Engineer to assure a uniform application that covers the entire pavement and to assure that excessive asphalt does not cause a slippage plane between two pavement courses .

If the results of the point counts show that the percentages of coarse aggregate fine aggregate air content and paste vary by more than between any of these three cores that type of member shall not be permitted to be constructed with Class SP concrete .
If at some time after the above mentioned worstcase test member is fabricated and tested the Fabricator needs to fabricate a member larger than this worstcase member which would now be a new worstcase member the Engineer shall determine based on the test results from the previous worstcase member whether or not the testing required in this section will again be required for this new worstcase member .
If the test results from the previous worstcase member are within an acceptable margin below the allowable test criteria and if the new worstcase member is not significantly larger than the previous worstcase member then the Engineer may allow this new worst case member to be constructed with Class SP concrete without additional pre qualification testing required in this section .

Use equipment that has the ability to automatically proportion the material components within the mix ratio tolerances set by the epoxy materials manufacturer. . Use equipment that has the ability to automatically mix the epoxy component materials within the pump and injection apparatus .
Crack Surface Preparation and Cleaning Requirements After the concrete beam has achieved day shipping strength clean the concrete surface along the crack of all deteriorated concrete efflorescence and other contaminants which would be detrimental to the adhesion of the surface sealing epoxy compound .
The substrate must be sound dry on the surface and free from oil and grease .
Blow out the crack with oil free and dry compressed air .
Epoxy Injection Place the base of the injection ports directly over the crack and bond to the substrate with an epoxy paste or the recommended product by the epoxy resin manufacturer .
The injection ports should be spaced over the length of the crack at a spacing that will allow the epoxy resin to seal the entire crack traveling from one port to another .
The ports spacing is dependent upon the viscosity of the resin .
Use an epoxy adhesive to seal over the surface ports and exposed cracks .
The entire exposed crack is to be covered with the epoxy adhesive leaving only the port holes uncovered .
The cure time for the epoxy will be based upon concrete temperature .
The temperature requirements of the concrete for the injected resin must be satisfied before the process can begin .
Begin injecting at the lowest port on the beam and continue until the epoxy resin begins to ooze out of the port above it .
The ooze out of the port above it is a sign that the crack has been filled to that level .
Plug the first port with a cap and move up to the next port repeating this procedure until the entire crack has been filled with epoxy .
Use slow constant pressure to inject the epoxy into the crack which will reduce the possibility of leaks or blowouts and allow time for the repair material to fully penetrate the crack .
Post Epoxy Injection After a minimum of hours the injection ports can be removed from the beam .
Clean the concrete surface areas of excess epoxy injection work .
Clean so as to not damage the concrete by scraping light sand blasting grinding use of solvents or any other appropriate method approved by the engineer .
Clean the excess materials so that no epoxy material or injection ports extend beyond the plane surface of the concrete .

For Vtype heating the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in truncated triangular or wedgeshaped areas having their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange the spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the required curvature and heating shall progress along the top and bottom flange at approximately the same rate .
For Vtype heating the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface shall terminate just before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached .

The girder shall not be artificially cooled until after naturally cooling to F. Cooling with dry compressed air after the steel has cooled to below F is permitted .
Do not cool the steel with water or mist .
Allow steel to cool below F before applying another set of heating patterns .
Do not handle support or load the member in a manner that causes material to yield without the application of heat .
Position for Heating The girder may be heatcurved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
If the radius is less than feet heat curve only with the web in the horizontal position or preload to induce stress prior to heating .
Do not heat curve portions of members where the required radius of curvature is less than feet and the flange width exceeds inches .
When curved in the vertical position the girder must be braced or supported in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heatcurving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
When curved in the horizontal position the girder must be supported near its ends and at intermediate points if required to obtain a uniform curvature the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder must not exceed the usual allowable design stress .
When the girder is positioned horizontally for heating intermediate safety catch blocks must be maintained at the midlength of the girder within inches mm of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
Sequence of Operations The girder shall be heatcurved in the fabrication shop before it is painted .
The heat curving operation may be conducted either before or after all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed .
However unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage connection plates and bearing stiffeners shall be located and attached after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required they shall be heatcurved or oxygencut separately and then welded to the curved girder .
When cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams they may be attached before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than ½ inches .
mm and the radius of the curvature is greater than feet meters .
For other rolled beams with cover plates the beams must be heatcurved before the cover plates are attached cover plates must be either heat curved or oxygencut separately and then welded to the curved beam .
Camber Girders shall be cambered before heat curving .
Camber for rolled beams may be obtained by heatcambering methods approved by the Engineer .
For plate girders the web shall be cut to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat curving .
However subject to the approval of the Engineer moderate deviations from specified camber may be corrected by a carefully supervised application of heat .
Measurement of Curvature and Camber Horizontal curvature and vertical camber shall be measured for final acceptance after all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the girder in the vertical position .

.. Removal of Casing Removal of the casing from a shaft may occur gradually as concrete is placed .
Insofar as possible casing extraction shall be done at a slow uniform rate by application of a steady vertical upward pull in the direction of the axis of the shaft .
To facilitate extraction tapping on the casing exertion of temporary downward pressure slight rotation or the controlled use of a vibratory hammer will be permitted but care must be taken to avoid harmful impacts or disturbances to the fresh concrete .
Vibration or rodding may not be used to break the casing loose for extraction .
If during extraction of casing upward movement of concrete andor reinforcing steel occurs the Engineer shall be notified immediately .
If he considers the movement to be minor he may permit the extraction of the casing to continue .
If however the movement is deemed significant and indicative of squeezing of the surrounding soil thus resulting in a reduction of the caisson diameter then he may order the casing to be left in place or he may permit extraction to proceed and order a later nondestructive load test or may order other procedures as appropriate at no additional cost to the Division .
For the upper portions of drilled caissons that will be exposed and visible the casing may remain in place as a form until the concrete has attained a strength that enables it to stand alone without further deformation .
Casing shall then be removed .
.INSPECTION OF SOCKETS .. Depth of Rock Socket Each rock socket shall be drilled to the shaft diameter shown in the plans unless otherwise directed by the Engineer based on subsurface conditions encountered .
The top elevation of competent rock must be confirmed as the socket drilling is started .
The effective top elevation is based on observation of the boundary zone where broken or weathered rock becomes competent rock and is also influenced by the presence of any shale or coal seams .
Based on that elevation and the information from the preinstallation core hole the Engineer will determine the final depth of socket and bottom elevation .
The drilled rock socket will then be inspected per and will either be accepted or drilled deeper as determined by the Engineer .
.. Inspection Under Water In a case where it is considered unfeasible to dewater a caisson the Contractor shall provide drilled caisson logs and screenings to the Engineer for evaluation .
If this material is not sufficient for a proper judgement the Engineer will reserve the right to order an inspection by diving or other methods either through a separate specialty subcontractor or through the Contractor in which case compensation would be under Sections .
and .
of the Standard Specifications .
Any time required for inspection under water will be considered incidental to the work and will not be cause for extra compensation related to a claim or extension of contract time .

.GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The Engineer has the authority to limit the surface area of erodible earth material exposed by clearing and grubbing to limit the surface area of erodible earth material exposed by excavation borrow and fill operations and to direct the Contractor to provide immediate permanent or temporary pollution control measures as necessary to prevent contamination of adjacent streams or other watercourses lakes ponds or other areas of water impoundment .
Such work may involve the construction of temporary berms ditch checks check dams sediment structures traps ponds or dams slope drains and use of temporary mulches mats seeding or other control devices or methods as necessary to control erosion .
The Contractor shall incorporate all permanent erosion control features into the project at the earliest practicable time as outlined in their acceptable schedule .
Temporary pollution control measures shall be used to correct conditions that develop during construction that were not foreseen during the design stage that are needed prior to installation of permanent pollution control features or that are needed temporarily to control erosion that develops during normal construction practices but are not associated with permanent control features on the project .
Where erosion is likely to be a problem clearing and grubbing operations shall be so scheduled and performed that grading operations and permanent erosion control features can follow immediately if the project conditions permit otherwise temporary erosion control measures may be required between successive construction stages .
The Engineer will limit the area of excavation borrow and embankment operations in progress commensurate with the Contractors capability and progress in keeping the finish grading mulching seeding and other such permanent pollution control measures current in accordance with the accepted schedule .
Should seasonal limitations make such coordination unrealistic temporary erosion control measures shall be taken immediately to the extent feasible and justified .
Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer construction operations in rivers streams and impoundments shall be restricted to those areas where channel changes are shown on the Plans and to those areas which must be entered for the construction of temporary or permanent structures .
Rivers streams and impoundments shall be promptly cleared of all falsework piling debris or other obstructions placed or caused by the construction operations .
Excavation from any source shall not be deposited in or near rivers streams or impoundments or otherwise located in such a manner which might be susceptible to erosion due to high water flooding or runoff .
