Segregation Payment Adjustments Payment adjustments for pavement segregation shall apply to the top lift of ACP only and in accordance with the following Segregated areas centreofpaver streak and any repaired segregated areas identified by the Consultant either during construction or during the inspection conducted weeks after the completion of paving work will be used to determine payment adjustments .
Payment adjustments will not apply to segregated areas .
m or less or on centreofpaver streaks m or less in length .
Segregated areas excluding centreofpaver streaks separated by less than m shall be considered a single area for the determination of payment adjustments .
For centreofpaver streak each area will be measured separately for payment adjustments .
Payment adjustments for segregation will not apply to entrances or the portion of an intersection outside the through travel lanes and shoulders .
If a segregated area is identified by the Contractor and repaired prior to inspection by the Consultant it will be classified as moderate for the purpose of determining payment adjustments .
Payment adjustments will apply regardless of the year the pavement is placed and the year the pavement is inspected .
Payment adjustments will not apply to instances where the Consultant determines that the paver screed is dragging .
The total payment adjustment for segregation is determined as follows Section Specification .
Asphalt Concrete Pavement Superpave AUGUST Each lane.km of the completed pavement is inspected separately by the Consultant .
A lane includes the adjoining shoulder .
Measurement of lane.kms will be made in kilometre or partial kilometre long segments lane wide as shown on the Contract Drawing .

per linear metre Total payment adjustment per lanekm for segregation will be the sum of Tables A B and C. For partial lane kilometres the payment adjustments for Table A will be prorated based upon the actual length of segment assessed .
Lane kilometres with no areas of segregation of any type or severity or any centreofpaver streaks will be assigned a bonus payment of per lane.km .
For partial lane.kms the bonus will be prorated based upon the actual length of the segment assessed .
Lane kilometres with or areas of slight segregation no moderate or severely segregated areas and no centreofpaver streak will be assigned a bonus payment of per lane.km .
Section Specification .
Asphalt Concrete Pavement Superpave AUGUST For partial lane.kms the bonus will be prorated based upon the actual length of the segment assessed .
The maximum penalty adjustment for segregation shall be limited to per lanekm .
For partial lanekms this adjustment will be prorated based upon the actual length of segment assessed .
Payment For Work That Had Been Rejected But Was Made Acceptable When defects have been remedied in Lots or Sublots which had been rejected payment for the original quantity of material in those Lots or Sublots will be made subject to unit price adjustments and penalty assessments determined as follows i Penalty or bonus assessments will be made for smoothness as follows Penalty or bonus assessments for PrI will be the amounts shown in the applicable section of Table .
C and will be based on Profilograph tests following the Contractors corrective efforts for any bumps and dips .
The penalty assessment for each bump or dip over mm will be .
for multilift pavements and .
for singlelift or curb and gutter applications .
Penalty assessments for bumps and dips will be based on initial profilograph testing conducted by the Consultant .
Repairs carried out by the Contractor will not affect the penalty assessment for bumps and dips .
If bumps or dips are treated by the Contractor prior to Profilograph tests by the Consultant such defects will be considered greater than mm and will be assessed at the applicable penalty assessment rates .
ii The unit price adjustment for Asphalt Content Density and Gradation will be based on testing of the replacement or overlay material where applicable .
Where replacement or overlay material does not cover the entire Lot or Sublot prior tests on the uncovered area will be averaged with new tests on the corrective work .
