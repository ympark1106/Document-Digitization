Standard Specifications M Page Foreword These Standard Specifications for Road Bridge and Municipal Construction have been developed to serve as a baseline for the work delivered to the public by the Washington State Department of Transportation WSDOT .
The Standard Specifications are incorporated into the written agreement Contract between WSDOT as Contracting Agency and the Contractor except where the Contract indicates that a particular specification has been amended or replaced with a special provision to resolve projectspecific issues .
The decision to amend or replace any standard specification with a special provision is made during the design process and is based upon the sound engineering judgment of the project designer .
These Standard Specifications reflect years of refinement through the literally hundreds of projects the Department delivers each year .
In addition the standards are the result of countless hours of development and review by both our internal WSDOT staff as well as our industry partners through the joint WSDOTAssociated General Contractors Standing Committees .
Finally these standards reflect the contracting philosophy and balance of riskallocation that the Department has adopted through the years .
We believe that this balance of risks provides us the lowest final cost solution to our transportation needs .
For example shifting risk to the Contractor can provide more certainty on final cost but may result in higher initial cost .
On the other hand accepting more risk by the owner can result in lower initial costs but less certainty on the final cost .
We at the Department of Transportation believe that we have reached the optimum point of balance for risk and we will continue to consider this balance on all future specification revisions .
The language above indicates that these specifications are to be used only as a guideline during the design process and that is true .
Once they have been incorporated into a Contract however they become the legal and enforceable language of that Contract .
The Standard Specifications the Amendments to the Standards and the Project Special Provisions along with any attachments in the Contract documents define a Contract and are no longer seen as guidelines .
Rather they are the written agreement subject to revision only through the change order process .
This preface is for informational purposes only and is not to be used to interpret or affect the terms .

Standard Specifications M Page Scope of the Work .
Variation in Estimated Quantities Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of Work performed and accepted in conformance with the Contract .
When the accepted quantity of Work performed under a unit item varies from the original Proposal quantity payment will be at the unit Contract price for all Work unless the total accepted quantity of any Contract item adjusted to exclude added or deleted amounts included in change orders accepted by both parties increases or decreases by more than percent from the original Proposal quantity .
In that case payment for Contract Work may be adjusted as described herein .
The adjusted final quantity shall be determined by starting with the final accepted quantity measured after all Work under an item has been completed .
From this amount subtract any quantities included in additive change orders accepted by both parties .
Then to the resulting amount add any quantities included in deductive change orders accepted by both parties .
The final result of this calculation shall become the adjusted final quantity and the basis for comparison to the original Proposal quantity . .
Increased Quantities Either party to the Contract will be entitled to renegotiate the price for that portion of the adjusted final quantity in excess of .
times the original Proposal quantity .
The price for excessive increased quantities will be determined by agreement of the parties or where the parties can not agree the price will be determined by the Engineer based upon the actual costs to perform the Work including reasonable markup for overhead and profit . .
Decreased Quantities Either party to the Contract will be entitled to an equitable adjustment if the adjusted final quantity of Work performed is less than percent of the original Bid quantity .
The equitable adjustment shall be based upon and limited to three factors a .
Any increase or decrease in unit costs of labor materials or equipment utilized for Work actually performed resulting solely from the reduction in quantity b .
Changes in production rates or methods of performing Work actually done to the extent that the nature of the Work actually performed differs from the nature of the Work included in the original plan and c. An adjustment for the anticipated contribution to unavoidable fixed cost and overhead from the units representing the difference between the adjusted final quantity and percent of the original Plan quantity .
The following limitations shall apply to renegotiated prices for increases andor equitable adjustments for decreases .
The equipment rates shall be actual cost but shall not exceed the rates set forth in the AGCWSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement referred to in Section .
that is in effect at the time the Work is performed. . No payment will be made for extended or unabsorbed home office overhead and field overhead expenses to the extent that there is an unbalanced allocation of such expenses among the Contract Bid items. . No payment for consequential damages or loss of anticipated profits will be allowed because of any variance in quantities from those originally shown in the Proposal form Contract Provisions and Contract Plans . .
The total payment including the adjustment amount and unit prices for Work performed for any item that experiences an equitable adjustment for decreased quantity shall not exceed percent of the amount originally Bid for the item .
If the adjusted final quantity of any item does not vary from the quantity shown in the Proposal by more than percent then the Contractor and the Contracting Agency agree that all Work under that item will be performed at the original Contract unit price .
When ordered by the Engineer the Contractor shall proceed with the Work pending determination of the cost or time adjustment for the variation in quantities .

Upon written notification the Engineer will investigate the conditions and if heshe determines that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any Work under the Contract an adjustment excluding loss of anticipated profits will be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of hisher determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
The equitable adjustment will be by agreement with the Contractor .
However if the parties are unable to agree the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with Section .. Extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section ..
If the Engineer determines that different site conditions do not exist and no adjustment in costs or time is warranted such determination shall be final as provided in Section ..
If there is a decrease in the costs or time required to perform the Work failure of the Contractor to notify the Engineer of the differing site conditions shall not affect the Contracting Agencys right to make an adjustment in the costs or time .
No claim by the Contractor shall be allowed unless the Contractor has followed the procedures provided in Sections .

Pavement Thickness Cement concrete pavement shall be constructed in accordance with the thickness requirements in the Plans and Specifications .
Tolerances allowed for Subgrade construction and other provisions which may affect thickness shall not be construed to modify such thickness requirements .
A primary unit of pavement is defined as the area of pavement placed in each days paving operations or a complete intersection .
Within such primary unit of pavement there may be an area or areas which are deficient in thickness by more than .
foot .
This deficient area or areas will be defined as a secondary unit or units .
If secondary units are found to exist the primary unit area will be reduced by the secondary unit area included therein .
At a time determined by the Engineer thickness measurements will be made in each primary unit of Page Standard Specifications M Cement Concrete Pavement pavement at the minimum rate of one measurement for each cubic yards of pavement or fraction thereof .
The exact location and number of thickness measurements within each primary unit both longitudinally and transversely will be determined by the Engineer .
In general thickness measurements will be made at uniform intervals throughout each primary unit of pavement .
If thickness deficiencies greater than .
foot are found to exist supplemental thickness measurements will be made in accordance with Section .B .
Pavement thickness variations if any from the thickness requirements in the Plans and Specifications will be determined by comparing the actual thickness measurement with the thickness specified at the location where the measurement was made .
Such variation will be determined to the nearest .
foot as either excess or deficient thickness .
Additional cores may be requested by the Contractor to isolate the area that has a thickness deficiency within the .
feet of the design thickness .
These cores will be used to create a secondary unit .
All costs for the additional cores including grouting the core holes will be the responsibility of the Contractor .

foot is encountered the Engineer will determine from supplemental thickness measurements the limits of the secondary unit area .
Thickness measurements will be made in each panel of pavement adjacent transversely and longitudinally to the panel of the original measurement .
This procedure will continue regardless of unit boundaries until such secondary unit area is bounded by panels with a thickness deficiency of .
foot or less .
Cores taken to isolate the secondary unit will not be used to compute average thickness of the primary unit .
Panels are the areas bounded by longitudinal and transverse joints and pavement edges .
If longitudinal or transverse joints are eliminated by the Special Provisions by the Plans or for any other reasons the limits of panels will be determined by the Engineer as if such joints had been constructed .
The secondary unit area will be made up of entire panels only .
The entire panel will be considered to be of the thickness shown by measurement .
After the Engineer has determined the limits of the secondary unit area a further determination will be made whether any panels within this area are usable and may be left in place .
Following this determination the Contractor shall remove and replace at no expense to the Contracting Agency such panels as the Engineer may designate in accordance with the following Standard Specifications M Page Cement Concrete Pavement If the area to be removed is not bounded by longitudinal or transverse joints the Contractor shall saw at no expense to the Contracting Agency weakened plane joints at the locations designated by the Engineer .

Piling Terms Concrete Piles Concrete piling may be precast or precastprestressed concrete or steel casings driven to the ultimate bearing resistance called for in the Contract which are filled with concrete castinplace after driving .
Steel Piles Steel piles may be openended or closedended pipe piles or Hpiles .
Overdriving Overdriving of piles occurs when the ultimate bearing resistance calculated from the equation in Section .
or the wave equation driving criteria if applicable exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance required in the Contract in order to reach the minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract or as required by the Engineer .
Maximum Driving Resistance The maximum driving resistance is either the pile ultimate bearing resistance or ultimate bearing resistance plus overdriving to reach minimum tip elevation as specified in the Contract whichever is greater .
Wave Equation Analysis Wave equation analysis is an analysis performed using the wave equation analysis program WEAP with a version dated or later .
The wave equation may be used as specified herein to verify the Contractors proposed pile driving system .
The pile driving system includes but is not necessarily limited to the pile the hammer the helmet and any cushion .
The wave equation may also be used by the Engineer to determine pile driving criteria as may be required in the Contract .
Ultimate Bearing Resistance Ultimate bearing resistance refers to the vertical load carrying resistance in units of force of a pile as determined by the equation in Section .
the wave equation analysis pile driving analyzer and CAPWAP static load test or any other means as may be required by the Contract or the Engineer .
Allowable Bearing Resistance Allowable bearing resistance is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by a factor of safety .
The Contract may state the factor of safety to be used in calculating the allowable bearing resistance from the ultimate bearing resistance .
In the absence of a specified factor of safety a value of three shall be used .
Rated Hammer Energy The rated energy represents the theoretical maximum amount of gross energy that a pile driving hammer can generate .
The rated energy of a pile driving hammer will be stated in the hammer manufacturers catalog or Specifications for that pile driving hammer .
Developed Hammer Energy The developed hammer energy is the actual amount of gross energy produced by the hammer for a given blow .
This value will never exceed the rated hammer energy .
The developed energy may be calculated as the ram weight times the drop Standard Specifications M Page Piling or stroke for drop single acting hydraulic single acting airsteam and openended diesel hammers .
For double acting hydraulic and airsteam hammers the developed hammer energy shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means approved by the Engineer .
For closedended diesel hammers the developed energy shall be calculated from the measured bounce chamber pressure for a given blow .
Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy .
For a single acting diesel hammer the developed energy is determined using the blows per minute .
Transferred Hammer Energy The transferred hammer energy is the amount of energy transferred to the pile for a given blow .
This value will never exceed the developed hammer energy .
Factors that cause transferred hammer energy to be lower than the developed hammer energy include friction during the ram down stroke energy retained in the ram and helmet during rebound and other impact losses .
The transferred energy can only be measured directly by use of sensors attached to the pile .
A pile driving analyzer PDA may be used to measure transferred energy .
Pile Driving Analyzer A pile driving analyzer PDA is a device which can measure the transferred energy of a pile driving system the compressive and tensile stresses induced in the pile due to driving the bending stresses induced by hammer misalignment with the pile and estimate the ultimate resistance of a pile at a given blow .
Pile Driving System The pile driving system includes but is not necessarily limited to the hammer leads helmet or cap cushion and pile .
Helmet The helmet also termed the cap drive cap or driving head is used to transmit impact forces from the hammer ram to the pile top as uniformly as possible across the pile top such that the impact force of the ram is transmitted axially to the pile .
The term helmet can refer to the complete impact force transfer system which includes the anvil or striker plate hammer cushion and cushion block and a pile cushion if used or just the single piece unit into which these other components anvil hammer cushion etc .
fit .
The helmet does not include a follower if one is used .
For hydraulic hammers the helmet is sometimes referred to as the anvil .
Hammer Cushion The hammer cushion is a disk of material placed on top of the helmet but below the anvil or striker plate to relieve impact shock thus protecting the hammer and the pile .
Pile Cushion The pile cushion is a disk of material placed between the helmet and the pile top to relieve impact shock primarily to protect the pile .
Follower A follower is a structural member placed between the hammer assembly which includes the helmet and the pile top when the pile head is below the reach of the hammer .
Pile Driving Refusal Pile driving refusal is defined as blows per inch for the last inches of driving .
This is the maximum blow count allowed during overdriving .
