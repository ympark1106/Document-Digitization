ACCEPTANCE A .
The Department accepts rejects or applies price reductions to all mix lots for performancegraded asphalt binder PGAB lots according to the compliance and rejection limits of Table the Minimum Sampling and Testing Requirements UDOT Quality Management Plan and the associated mix specification . .
Rejected mix will be covered according to the associated mix specification including removal or if left in place the associated disincentive dollar amount for the rejected mix .
Implementation Asphalt Material Page of January .
Material not meeting the compliance limit but within the rejection limit the price reduction applied to the mix pay item price is calculated as follows .
The composite price reduction will be calculated by summing the price reduction for each parameter if more than one parameter lies outside specification limits .
a .
The mix material will be rejected if the composite price reduction exceeds .
B .
The maximum composite price reduction from the tested samples is applied to the mix in the binder lot if multiple samples from the binder lot are tested .
C. Adjacent samples in the preceding current or subsequent lots may be tested to assess the extent and limit the amount of mix to be rejected if a binder lot is rejected .
