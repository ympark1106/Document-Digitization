Commercially Useful Function MaineDOT will count expenditures of a DBE contractor toward DBE goals only if the DBE is performing a commercially useful function on that contract .
A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing managing and supervising the work involved .
Credit will only be given when the DBE meets all conditions for a CUF .
Credit for labor will be in accordance with the responsibilities outlined in the contract .
To perform a commercially useful function the DBE must also be responsible with respect to materials and supplies used on the Contract for negotiating price determining quality and quantity ordering the materials and installing where applicable and paying for the material itself .
To determine whether a DBE is performing a commercially useful function MaineDOT will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted industry practices whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the Contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work and other relevant factors .
Rented equipment used by the DBE must not be rented from the Prime Contractor on a job that the DBE is subcontracted with that Prime Contractor for regular course of business .
A current listing of certified DBEs that may wish to participate in the highway construction program and the scope of work for which they are certified can be found at httpwww.maine.govmdotcivilrightsdbe.htm .
Credit will be given for the value described by a DBE performing as A .
A prime contractor of actual value of work performed by own workforces .
B .
An approved subcontractor of work performed by own workforces .

Raceneutral Goals The Maine DOT is required to set an annual goal approved on a three year basis for DBE participation in Federalaid projects .
In order to fulfill that goal bidders are encouraged to utilize DBE businesses certified by the MaineDOT .
MaineDOT seeks to meet the established DBE goal solely through raceneutral means .
Raceneutral DBE participation occurs when a DBE is awarded a prime contract through customary competitive procurement procedures is awarded a subcontract on a contract that does not carry a DBE contract goal or wins a subcontract from a prime contractor that did not consider its DBE status in making the award .
A DBEsubcontractor Utilization Proposed Form is required to be included in bid documents .
MaineDOT will analyze each project and create a Project Availability Target PAT based on a number of factors including project scope available DBE firms firms certified in particular project work etc .
Each bid will request that the contractor attempt to meet the PAT .
This PAT is developed to assist contractors to better understand what the MaineDOT expectations are for a specific project .
The PAT is NOT a mandate but an assessment of what this particular project can bear for DBE participation .
The Department anticipates that each contractor will make the best effort to reach or exceed this PAT for the project .
Raceconscious Project Goals If it is determined by the Department that the annual DBE goal will not be met through raceneutral means the Department may implement raceconscious contract goals on some projects .
Raceconscious contract goals are goals that are enforceable by the Department and require that the prime contractor use good faith effort to achieve the goal set by the Department for that particular project .
If race conscious means are implemented on a project the Prime must comply with the requirements of CFR .
At the time of the bid opening all Bidders shall submit with their bid a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise DBE Commitment Form provided by the Department .
This form will list the DBE and nonDBE firms that are proposed to be used during the execution of the Work .
The list shall show the name of the firm the itemmaterialtype of work involved and the dollar amount of work to be performed .
The dollar total of each commitment shall be totaled and a percentage determined .
If the project goal is not met acceptable documentation showing all good faith efforts made to obtain participation may be required in order to award the project .
Failure to provide the required listing with the dollar participation total or acceptable documentation of good faith efforts to obtain DBE participation within days after the bid opening date will be considered a lack of responsiveness on the part of the low bidder .
Rejection of the low bid under these circumstances will require the low bidder to surrender the Proposal Guaranty to the Department .
The submission and approval of the above forms does not constitute a formal subcontract .
If for any reason during the progress of the Work the Contractor finds that DBEs included on the list are unable to perform the proposed work the Contractor with written release by the committed DBE or approval of the Department may substitute other DBE firms for those named on the list .
If the Contractor is able to clearly document their inability to find qualified substitute firms to meet the project goal the Contractor may request in writing approval to substitute the DBE with a nonDBE firm .
If at any time during the life of the Contract it is determined that the Contractor is not fulfilling the goal or commitments and is not making a good faith effort to fulfill the DBE requirement the Department may withhold progress payments .
If good faith effort is determined by the Department failure to meet the DBE contract goal will not be a detriment to the bid award .
Fulfillment of the goal percentage shall be determined by dividing the dollars committed to the DBEs by the actual contract dollars .
These requirements are in addition to all other Equal Employment Opportunity requirements on Federalaid contracts .
Certification of DBE attainment on Contracts The MaineDOT must certify that it has conducted postaward monitoring of all contracts to ensure that DBEs had done the work for which credit was claimed .
The certification is for the purpose of ensuring accountability for monitoring which the regulation already requires .

B .
Materials a. Convict Produced Materials References U.S.C .
b CFR .
Applicability FHWAs prohibition against the use of convict material only applies to Federalaid highways .
Materials produced after July by convict labor may only be incorporated in a Federalaid highway construction project if such materials have been produced by convicts who are on parole supervised release or probation from a prison or A such material has been produced in a qualified prison facility e.g .
prison industry with the amount produced during any month period for use in Federalaid projects not exceeding the amount produced for such use during the month period ending July .
Materials obtained from prison facilities e.g .
prison industries are subject to the same requirements for Federalaid participation that are imposed upon materials acquired from other sources .
Materials manufactured or produced by convict labor will be given no preferential treatment .
The preferred method of obtaining materials for a project is through normal contracting procedures which require the contractor to furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work .
The contractor selects the source public or private from which the materials are to be obtained CFR .. Prison industries are prohibited from bidding on projects directly CFR .e but may act as material supplier to construction contractors .
Prison materials may also be approved as Statefurnished material .
However since public agencies may not bid in competition with private firms direct acquisition of materials from a prison industry for use as Statefurnished material is subject to a public interest finding with the Division Administrators concurrence CFR .d .
Selection of materials produced by convict labor as Statefurnished materials for mandatory use should be cleared prior to the submittal of the Plans Specifications Estimates PSE .
b. PatentedProprietary Products References U.S.C .
CFR .
FHWA will not participate directly or indirectly in payment for any premium or royalty on any patented or proprietary material specification or process specifically set forth in the plans and specifications for a project unless the item is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable unpatented items the STA certifies either that the proprietary or patented item is essential for synchronization with the existing highway facilities or that no equally suitable alternative exists or the item is used for research or for a special type of construction on relatively short sections of road for experimental purposes .
States should follow FHWAs procedures for Construction Projects Incorporating Experimental Features expermnt.htm for the submittal of work plans and evaluations .
The primary purpose of the policy is to have competition in selection of materials and allow for development of new materials and products .
The policy further permits materials and products that are judged equal may be bid under generic specifications .
If only patented or proprietary products are acceptable they shall be bid as alternatives with all or at least a reasonable number of acceptable materials or products listed and the Division Administrator may approve a single source if it can be found that its utilization is in the public interest .
A Trade names are generally the key to identifying patented or proprietary materials .
Trade name examples include M Corten etc .
Generally products identified by their brand or trade name are not to be specified without an or equal phrase and if trade names are used all or at least a reasonable number of acceptable equal materials or products should be listed .
The licensing of several suppliers to produce a product does not change the fact that it is a single product and should not be specified to the exclusion of other equally suitable products .
c. State Preference References U.S.C .
CFR .
Materials produced within Maine shall not be favored to the exclusion of comparable materials produced outside of Maine .
State preference clauses give particular advantage to the designated source and thus restrict competition .
Therefore State preference provisions shall not be used on any Federalaid construction projects .
This policy also applies to State preference actions against materials of foreign origin except as otherwise permitted by Federal law .
Thus States can not give preference to inState material sources over foreign material sources .
Under the Buy America provisions the States are permitted to expand the Buy America restrictions provided that the STA is legally authorized under State law to impose more stringent requirements .
d. State OwnedFurnishedDesignated Materials References U.S.C .
CFR .
Current FHWA policy requires that the contractor must furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work and the contractor shall be permitted to select the sources from which the materials are to be obtained .
Exceptions to this requirement may be made when there is a definite finding by MaineDOT and concurred in by Federal Highway Administrations FHWA Division Administrator that it is in the public interest to require the contractor to use materials furnished by the MaineDOT or from sources designated by MaineDOT .
The exception policy can best be understood by separating Statefurnished materials into the categories of manufactured materials and local natural materials .
Manufactured Materials When the use of Statefurnished manufactured materials is approved based on a public interest finding such use must be made mandatory .
The optional use of Statefurnished manufactured materials is in violation of our policy prohibiting public agencies from competing with private firms .
Manufactured materials to be furnished by MaineDOT must be acquired through competitive bidding unless there is a public interest finding for another method and concurred in by FHWAs Division Administrator .
Local Natural Materials When MaineDOT owns or controls a local natural materials source such as a borrow pit or a stockpile of salvaged pavement material etc .
the materials may be designated for either optional or mandatory use however mandatory use will require a public interest finding PIF and FHWAs Division Administrators concurrence .
A In order to permit prospective bidders to properly prepare their bids the location cost and any conditions to be met for obtaining materials that are made available to the contractor shall be stated in the bidding documents .
Mandatory Disposal Sites Normally the disposal site for surplus excavated materials is to be of the contractors choosing although an optional sites may be shown in the contract provisions .
A mandatory site shall be specified when there is a finding by MaineDOT with the concurrence of the Division Administrator that such placement is the most economical or that the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost .
Discussion of the mandatory use of a disposal site in the environmental document may serve as the basis for the public interest finding .
Summarizing FHWA policy for the mandatory use of borrow or disposal sites mandatory use of either requires a public interest finding and FHWAs Division Administrators concurrence mandatory use of either may be based on environmental consideration where the environment will be substantially enhanced without excessive additional cost and where the use is based on environmental considerations the discussion in the environmental document may be used as the basis for the public interest finding .
Factors to justify a public interest finding should include such items as cost effectiveness system integrity and local shortages of material .
