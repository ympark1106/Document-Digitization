For material manufactured offsite use a manufacturer with an ISO certification or an effective testing and inspection system .
Require the manufacturer to clearly mark the material or packaging with a unique product identification or specification standard to which it is produced .
Other than references in or to the FAR or Federal Law when these Standard Specifications or Special Contract Requirements reference certifications certificates or certified documents equipment or individuals these references refer to documentation of nonregulatory peripheral contract requirements that are required to be validated by an individual or organization having unique knowledge or qualifications to perform such validation .
Check certifications before incorporating the material into the work to ensure that the requirements of the contract have been met .
Mark the certifications with the following information Project number and name Pay item number and description Contractors signature and Date .
Material accepted by certification may be sampled and tested .
If material is determined not to conform with the contract the material will be rejected whether in place or not .
Section One of the following certifications may be required a Production certification .
Material requiring a production certification is identified in the Acceptance Subsection of each Section .
Submit a production certification from the manufacturer for each shipment of material .
Include the following Date and place of manufacture Lot number or other means of crossreferencing to the manufacturers inspection and testing system and Substantiating evidence that the material conforms to the contract quality requirements as required by FAR .a including the following a Test results on material from the same lot and documentation of the inspection and testing system b A statement from the manufacturer that the material complies with the contract and c Manufacturers signature or other means of demonstrating accountability for the certification .
b Commercial certification .
Submit one commercial certification for similar material from the same manufacturer .
A commercial certification is a manufacturers or Contractors representation that the material complies with the contract .
The representation may be labels catalog data stamped specification standards or suppliers certifications indicating the material is produced to a commercial standard or specification . .
Measured or Tested Conformance .
Perform necessary measurements and tests to ensure work complies with the contract .
Use prevailing industry standards in the absence of contract requirements or tolerances .
Submit measurements tests and supporting data for acceptance. . Statistical Evaluation of Work and Determination of Pay Factor .
Statistical evaluation of work is a method of analyzing inspection or test results to determine conformity with the contract .
The work will be accepted as follows a General .
For work evaluated based on statistical evaluation both the Government and Contractor assume some risk .
The Governments risk is the probability that work of a rejectable quality level is accepted .
The Contractors risk is either the probability that work produced at an acceptable quality level AQL is rejected α or the probability that the work produced at the AQL is accepted at less than the contract unit bid price α .
Section Acceptable quality level is the lowest percentage of work within the specification limits that is considered acceptable for payment at contract unit bid price .
There are two categories Category I is based on an AQL of percent .
Category II is based on an AQL of percent .
In both cases the Contractors risk α is percent and the risk of rejection α is significantly lower .
As an incentive to produce uniform quality work and to offset the Contractors risk a final payment greater than the contract unit bid price may be obtained under certain conditions .
The quality characteristics to be evaluated sampling frequency sampling location test methods and category are listed in the Acceptance Subsection of each Section .
The following applies Lot size .
A lot is a discrete quantity of work to which the statistical evaluation procedure is applied .
A lot normally represents the total quantity of work produced .
More than one lot may occur if changes in the target values material sources or jobmix formula are requested in writing and approved .
Sampling frequency .
The frequency rate shown normally requires at least samples .
The minimum required to perform a statistical evaluation is samples .
The maximum obtainable pay factor with or samples is .. At least samples are required to obtain a . pay factor .
If the sampling frequencies and quantity of work would otherwise result in fewer than samples submit a written request to increase the sampling frequency to provide for at least samples .
Submit the request to increase the sampling frequency at least hours before beginning production .
An increase in the sampling frequency may result in a reduced pay factor .
Sampling location .
The exact location of sampling will be determined by the CO based on random numbers .
Specification limits .
The specification limits for the quality characteristics are listed in the contract for the work in question .
b Acceptance .
The work in the lot will be paid for at a final pay factor when all inspections or test results are completed and evaluated .
Before determining the final pay factor the work may be incorporated into the project provided the current pay factor does not fall below ..
If a lot is concluded with fewer than samples the material will be evaluated under Subsection ..
If the current pay factor of a lot falls below .
end production .
Production may resume after the Contractor takes effective and acceptable actions to improve the quality of the production .
A lot containing an unsatisfactory percentage of nonspecification material less than .
pay factor is accepted provided the lowest single pay factor has not fallen into the reject portion of Table .
A lot containing an unsatisfactory percentage of nonspecification material with the lowest single pay factor falling into the reject portion of Table is rejected .
Remove rejected material from the work .
Section When approved it is permissible to voluntarily remove nonspecification material and replace it with new material to avoid or minimize a pay factor of less than .. New material will be sampled tested and evaluated according to this Subsection .
Any quantity of material may be rejected based on visual inspection or test results .
Do not incorporate rejected material in the work .
The results of tests run on rejected material will be excluded from the lot .
c Statistical evaluation .
The VariabilityUnknownStandard Deviation Method will be used to determine the estimated percentage of the lot that is within specification limits .
The estimated percentage of work that is within the specification limits for each quality characteristic will be determined as follows Calculate the arithmetic mean x of the test values x n x where summation of x individual test value n total number of test values Calculate the standard deviations s n n x x n where x summation of the squares of individual test values x summation of the individual test values squared Calculate the upper quality index QU QU s USL x where USL upper specification limit Note The USL is equal to the contract specification limit or the target value plus the allowable deviation .
Calculate the lower quality index QL QL s x LSL where LSL lower specification limit Note The LSL is equal to the contract specification limit or the target value minus the allowable deviation .
From Table determine PU the estimated percentage of work within the USL .
PU corresponds to a given QU .
If a USL is not specified PU is .
From Table determine PL the estimated percentage of work within the lot within the LSL .
PL corresponds to a given QL .
If an LSL is not specified PL is .
Calculate the total estimated percentage of work within the USL and LSL PU PL Repeat steps through for each quality characteristic listed for statistical evaluation .

ROCK BLASTING Description .
This work consists of rock fragmentation blasting using production and controlled blasting techniques to construct engineered rock cuts. . Definitions .
a Production blasting .
Blasting using widely spaced blast holes that typically contain larger explosive charges to expedite movement and fragmentation for rock removal .
b Controlled blasting .
Blasting that includes presplit blasting and cushion blasting hole techniques .
Controlled blasting uses closelyspaced and carefully aligned blast holes that typically contain lighter charges than production holes to produce stable aesthetically pleasing rock faces with minimal blast damage .
Controlled blast holes are the first row of blast holes normally located within inches millimeters of the top of the staked slope .
Presplit blasting .
Presplit blasting detonates closely spaced backslope holes before drilling for production blasting or before detonating the production blasting holes to produce a highly controlled smooth cut face .
