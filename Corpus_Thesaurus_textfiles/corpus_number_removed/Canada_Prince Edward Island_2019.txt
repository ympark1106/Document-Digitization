GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY SEDIMENT TRAPS .. .
Description Work under this Section consists of the construction of a temporary sediment trappond by building an earthen embankment with a stone outlet to detain siltladen runoff from small disturbed areas generally less than ha long enough to allow the majority of sediment to settle .
These sediment traps receive concentrated runoff flows and are commonly installed in newly constructed road ditches at the down gradient point of the ditch work or immediately adjacent to this point of the ditch to function as a last location for sediment settling prior to release of the runoff water .
Refer to Section .. Sediment Traps of TIEs Environmental Protection Plan. . Material The random rip rap for the stone outlet shall be Class R in accordance with Section .
The geotechnical fabric shall have the minimum specifications as shown in Table .
Table Requirements for Geotechnical Fabric Property Min .

Construction Sediment traps should be an initial installation at a work site constructed prior to grubbing the site .
Sediment traps should not be located within metres of an inlet or an outlet of a cross road drainage structure .
The sediment trap should be designed to ensure that the ponding behind the structure achieves the purpose of providing adequate opportunity for suspended solids in the runoff water to settle .
The trap length should be at least twice the average width and the trap depth should be approximately m to provide adequate sediment retention capacity and to lessen the frequency of cleanout .
The trap depth can be increased should a greater retention volume be desired .
The trap shall have earthen embankments berms that will form an impoundment area .
The area under the embankments shall be cleared grubbed and stripped of any vegetation or roots before clean excavated fill is placed and compacted in mm layers .
The embankment side slopes should be no steeper than .
The top and outside slopes of the GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY SEDIMENT TRAPS .. earthen embankments shall be hydro seeded or seeded and covered with jute mat immediately after installation .
Immediately beyond the downstream end of the stone outlet an apron area shall be excavated to a depth of approximately mm below the bottom of impoundment elevation to receive the overflow water and to minimize associated erosion .
Following preparation of the impoundment embankments and the apron area the stone outlet area shall be prepared .
The outlet shall be located at the downstream end of the trap with its main spillway elevation approximately mm below the top of the impoundment embankments to ensure that discharge occurs through the spillway .
The spillway shall have a minimum width of mm in accordance with Figure .

At the upstream side of the outlet the fabric shall be securely toedin to the earthen base of the impoundment .
At the downstream side of the outlet the fabric shall extend into the apron area and be securely toedin to its earthen base material .
The riprap for the spillway core will then be placed on the fabric being careful not to damage the fabric .
The top of the spillway shall be mm lower than the adjacent embankments and the spillway core will extend across the full width of the outlet .
The core riprap then needs to be wrapped with geotechnical fabric .
At the upstream side of the outlet the fabric shall again extend down to the impoundment base and be securely toedin to the earthen base of the impoundment .
This will avoid undermining at the upstream side of the outlet .
The fabric will wrap overtop of the spillway riprap core down the downstream side of the core and will extend into the apron and be securely toedin to its earthen base material .
This fabric will extend at least as far into the apron as the previously installed fabric so that runoff flows overtop of the fabric and undermining of the apron is avoided .
Finally place remaining riprap on the side slopes of the outlet and on the downstream side of the spillway covering the fabric in these locations and in the apron area including overtop of the fabric in the apron . .
Maintenance The Contractor shall inspect regularly and after rainfalls of mm or more accumulation and repair any damaged areas .
Sediment shall be removed and the trap restored to its original dimensions when the trap is b full of sediment in accordance with Section .
