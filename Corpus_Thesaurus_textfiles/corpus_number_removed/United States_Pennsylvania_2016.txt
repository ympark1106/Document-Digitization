Progress payments will be made only when an itemized estimated force account of cost is provided in writing within working days after receipt of the Departments written authorization to perform the extra work on a force account basis. . Labor .
Wages of forepersons equipment operators and skilled semiskilled and common laborers directly assigned to the specific operation or directly involved in the offsite handling loading and transportation of material equipment andor purchased consumables needed specifically for the force account work will be reimbursed as direct labor at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid for each hour that such employees are engaged in the performance of authorized work and if directed overtime as provided for in existing laws regulations collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of labor employed in the work .
The workforce utilized and hours paid for offsite handling loading and transportation must be mutually agreed upon as being fair and reasonable given the nature and scope of the force account work .
Additionally if a labor crew assigned to the force account operation arrives on the job site and is not permitted to perform work of any kind i.e .
contract work Additional Work or Extra Work due to circumstances beyond its control payment of show up time as provided for in an existing collective bargaining agreement or employment contract will be reimbursed as direct labor at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid .
Reimbursement for the payment of reasonable travel time from a central meeting location to the site of the force account work andor for non working paid holidays may be made at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid if it is mutually agreed that such costs are unavoidable and being incurred for the convenience of the Department .
Additionally with regard to reimbursement for nonworking paid holidays the Contractor must show that the payment is required by existing laws regulations collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts or being made in accordance with an established written company policy and that any prerequisite or post requisite work hours were earned completely in the performance of the force account work .
Finally if a worker in a given labor classification is engaged in the performance of work not of the type typically performed by individuals in that classification and there is an OSHA requirement for specific Personal Protective Equipment PPE to be used by individuals performing such work the cost of the required PPE will be reimbursed as purchased consumables as specified in Section .d.a .
Indirect labor costs will be paid without markup as a percentage of the total base labor cost as supported by certified payroll records and when required a fringe benefit letter .
The total base labor cost will be the total amount paid directly to the force account workforce based on the actual wage rate paid each individual worker which is to include that portion of the workers fringe benefit rate also paid directly if any .
Any amount paid on behalf of the members of the force account workforce as tax exempt fringe benefits will not be included in the indirect labor cost computation .
Allowable indirect labor costs include the following Social Security Tax at the percentage legally required Medicare Tax at the percentage legally required Unemployment Taxes at the estimated effective rate computed as specified below Workers Compensation Insurance at the rate computed as specified below and Liability Insurance at the current policy period rate used to account for the cost of applicable Liability Insurance provided as specified in Sections .
and .. Update the liability rate annually in .d .d Change No .
ECMS prior to the start of each new policy period .
The Liability Insurance rate entered into ECMS is to be accompanied by a certification attesting to the fact that the rate being charged for Liability Insurance for force account work does not exceed the applicable current policy period rate used when determining unit prices for bidding purposes during the policy period .
Maintain appropriate records needed to verify the certification for audit purposes including bid documents records of all payments rate computations and policy statements in accordance with the provisions of Section .C Contractors and subcontractors are to compute their companys estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes for the current calendar year by dividing total companywide Pennsylvania and Federal Unemployment Tax payments for the prior calendar year by the total wages and salaries reported for applicable employees for the same period .
The tax payment wage and salary amounts used to compute the estimated effective rate are to be consistent with the information reported on Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation tax forms filed with the Department of Labor and Industry and on Federal Unemployment Tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service .
Each employer reports its state and federal unemployment tax payments under a unique account or identification number representing the company and all employees for whom unemployment taxes must be paid .
The gross wages and unemployment tax contribution reported on PA Form UC under the employers PA UC account number along with the total payments to all employees and FUTA tax liability reported on Form under the companys Employer Identification Number EIN are considered companywide amounts representing all applicable employees for the purpose of computing the companys estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes .
A companys estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes is to be recomputed by April of each calendar year based on the prior calendar years reported total wages and salaries and total tax payments .
Contractors and subcontractors are to compute their companys Workers Compensation Insurance rate based on an average of applicable policy premium costs amounts paid or credited for deductibles loss claims and retrospective adjustments and actual payroll basis over the last five consecutive complete policy periods .
The average of the policy premium amount established by the insurance carrier during its endofpolicy period premium adjustment audit for each of the last five consecutive complete policy periods is to be added to the average of the total amount paid during the last five consecutive complete policy periods for deductibles andor to settle loss claims and the average of the total amount paid to or credited by an insurance carrier current or prior during the last five consecutive complete policy periods as retrospective adjustments to policies in effect during prior policy periods dividing by the average of the applicable Payroll Basis for the last five consecutive complete policy periods and multiplying the result by .
The term policy periods as used herein is defined as the period of time covered by the last five consecutive Workers Compensation Insurance policies for which an endofpolicy period premium adjustment audit was completed .
When determining the policy premium amount for each year and its associated Payroll Basis only the portion of each that is attributable to the companys field or projectbased workforce need be included .
The portion of each that is attributable to the companys clerical or sales workforce may be excluded .
Additionally any premium amount and associated Payroll Basis that is attributable to a company workforce employed in a state other than PA may be excluded .
As support for the Workers Compensation Insurance rate being charged provide a copy of the last five consecutive endofpolicy period Audit Adjustment statements prepared by the insurance carrier and ensure each statement indicates the Payroll Basis upon which the adjusted premium was based .
Additionally provide a schedule i.e .
spreadsheet of applicable deductible and claim payments made during the last five consecutive complete policy periods and include at a minimum the amount payment date and invoice number for each payment .
Finally provide a schedule of applicable payments made and credits received during the last five consecutive complete policy periods as retrospective adjustments and include at a minimum the amount the paymentcredit date and the policy period to which each adjustment is applicable .
If a company involved in the performance of force account work has not been in business long enough to compute its Workers Compensation Insurance rate based on an average of five consecutive complete policy periods of cost data compute the companys Workers Compensation Insurance rate based on average cost data from all available consecutive complete policy periods .
Contractors and subcontractors will be required to enter their companys estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes into ECMS along with required supporting documentation prior to April th of each calendar year .
Additionally Contractors and subcontractors will be required to enter and their computed Workers Compensation Insurance and Liability Insurance rates into ECMS along with the applicable expiration date for each type of coverage prior to the start of each new insurance policy period .
Supporting documentation demonstrating that the Workers Compensation Insurance rate entered into ECMS was computed as specified above will be required as will the required Liability Insurance rate certification .
The coverage expiration date information will be tracked by ECMS and used to prompt the Contractor or subcontractor to update its rate information as existing policy periods expire .
.d .d Change No. . Material .
An item or product purchased specifically for the force account work that becomes a permanent part of the completed work will be considered a material for reimbursement purposes .
The cost of material used will be reimbursable including applicable sales tax and transportation costs charged by the material supplier. . Equipment .
Reasonable rental rates for equipment including trucks and machinery mutually considered necessary will be allowed computed as follows .a Owned Equipment .
The term owned equipment as used herein applies to equipment including trucks and machinery that the Contractor is required to provide for the proper execution of the original contract work as specified in Section .c whether such equipment is actually owned by the Contractor is leased rented or has been obtained in some other manner .
For any owned equipment used in the performance of force account work a rental rate will be determined using data obtained from the Rental Rate Blue Book aka .
EquipmentWatch Cost Recovery which is published by EquipmentWatch a division of Penton Inc. Blue Book published data considered current as of the first day that work is performed on a specific force account is the data that will remain applicable throughout the performance of such work even if Blue Book data for an applicable piece of owned equipment is updated during that time .
Outdated Blue Book data will be voided by the Department annually as of a specific date and no longer accepted thereafter .
The Department utilizes the Engineering and Construction Management System ECMS to keep electronic records of force account work .
To enable the Department to electronically account for owned equipment utilized by Contractors and subcontractors in the performance of force account work within ECMS the following actions must be taken Purchase a subscription to all necessary volumes of the Blue Book in electronic format based on the various ages of the pieces in the Contractors equipment inventory for Department projects Utilize the All Saved Models tool available to subscribers to create a Department project equipment inventory From the equipment included in the All Saved Models inventory create an equipment Group Use the Group Manager tool to select the applicable equipment Group and generate a Basic Fleet Report i.e .
the report that lists the ID subtype manufacturer model year serial number and configuration as applicable for each piece of equipment in the Group Using the available CSV button export the Basic Fleet Report to a spreadsheet and save the spreadsheet in a .csv Comma Separated Values file format .
Note Do not use the available PDF button to export the Basic Fleet Report as ECMS will not allow a spreadsheet saved in .pdf format to be imported .
At this point if the Contractor or subcontractors owned equipment inventory includes any pieces that are not listed in the Blue Book such equipment must be added to the spreadsheet .
When adding equipment with no Blue Book listing to the spreadsheet care should be taken to ensure that applicable information relating to ID subtype manufacturer model year serial number and configuration as it is entered is consistent with the existing column headings .
Log in to ECMS and import the .csv file using the Import Equipment hyperlink found on the Contractor Portal screen .
At a minimum the equipment Group imported to ECMS must include all of the owned equipment that will be used to perform the authorized force account work on a given project .
However to avoid having to repeat the above import procedure for future force account work on the same project or for force account work on other projects the Contractor may elect to import a spreadsheet file that lists all of the equipment assigned to a given project or its entire Department project owned equipment inventory .
The ECMS equipment Group import procedure may be repeated at any time e.g .
to import new pieces added to the inventory or to import a piece that was missed in a prior import .
An hourly rental rate for owned equipment will be computed by dividing the Blue Book monthly rate by .
To this rate the Blue Book area adjustment percentage for Pennsylvania and the age adjustment percentage for the .d .d Change No .
model year of the piece of equipment will be applied .
Blue Book citylevel regional adjustment factors will not be used in computing an hourly rental rate for owned equipment .
An allowance will be made for operating costs by adding to the above adjusted hourly rate the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour for each hour that the owned equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
If a piece of owned equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis but is not operating compensation if any will be at of the adjusted hourly rate exclusive of operating costs .
Payment for standby time will not be made on any day a piece of owned equipment is operated the entire work day .
For a standard hour work day when equipment operates less than hours payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that when added to the operating time for that day equals hours .
For work days that exceed hours when equipment operates less than hours payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that when added to the operating time for that day equals .
When force account work extends into one or more full weeks in any week period payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that when added to the operating time for that week equals hours regardless of the number of hours per day or days per week the Contractor works i.e .
overtime multiple shifts etc .. Payment for standby time will not be made on days the Contractor elects not to work or days not normally a work day .
Standby time will not be paid if equipment is awaiting repair while repairs are being made or for maintenance or servicing of equipment .
Standby time will not be paid for equipment not on the job site i.e .
while equipment is awaiting transport or being transported to the job site .
With the exception of owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic owned equipment used on a hour basis will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate which will be determined by dividing the Blue Book monthly rate by .
Owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a hour basis will be reimbursed at the Blue Book daily rate .
Applicable adjustment percentages from the Blue Book will be applied .
Where owned equipment utilized in the performance of force account work is not listed in the Blue Book a rental rate will be determined based on the sale price for such equipment at the time of purchase if the equipment is actually owned or the applicable lease agreement .
In these cases for equipment that is actually owned the monthly rate will be computed as of the sale price and the total hourly rate determined by dividing the monthly rate by when the equipment is operating and by when the equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis but not operating with no adjustment percentages applied .
For equipment that is leased an hourly rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
Additionally if not included in the lease cost an allowance will be made for operating costs by adding to the hourly rental rate the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour for an equivalent piece of equipment for each hour the equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
The equivalence of the piece of equipment in the Blue Book listing to the piece of equipment actually used must be mutually agreed upon .
With the exception of owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic owned equipment used on a hour basis with no listing in the Blue Book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate which will be computed as of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by with no adjustment percentages applied .
Owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a hour basis with no listing in the Blue Book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate which will be computed as of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by with no adjustment percentages applied .
If instead of being purchased the equipment was actually fabricated by the owner the sale price used to determine the daily rental rate will be the owners total documented fabrication cost .
If equipment used on a hour basis with no listing in the Blue Book is leased whether or not the equipment is used for maintenance and protection of traffic the daily rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
The rates established above include the cost of fuel oil lubrication supplies necessary attachments repairs overhaul and maintenance of any kind storage all costs of moving equipment on to and away from the work site except as specified below and all incidentals .
If a piece of owned equipment not already on or near the project site is needed specifically for the force account work the cost of moving the equipment on to and away from the work site will be reimbursed provided the equipment will not be used immediately thereafter in the performance of original contract work .
The Department will not approve any Contractor requests for reimbursement of owned equipment costs incurred in the performance of force account work in excess of those outlined above unless such costs were mutually agreed upon in writing based on an acceptable cost breakdown prepared by the Contractor .

Perform periodic retesting if ordered by the Representative .
Install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition .
Snug tight is defined as the tightness that exists when the plies of the joint are in firm contact .
Use a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench to attain the snug tight condition .
Snug tighten the bolts of the connection by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges and then retighten the bolts in a similar systematic manner as necessary until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted .
Following this initial operation further tighten all bolts in the connection by the applicable amount of rotation specified in Table B .
During the tightening operation do not allow rotation of the part not turned by the wrench .
Systematically tighten the bolts progressing from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
.e CalibratedWrench Tightening .
Use calibrated wrench tightening only if installation procedures are calibrated on a daily basis and if a hardened washer is used under the element turned in tightening .
Standard torques determined from tables or from formulas which are assumed to relate torque to tension are not acceptable .
When calibrated wrenches are used for installation set them to provide a tension not less than in excess of the minimum tension specified in Table A. Calibrate the installation procedures at least once each working day for each bolt diameter length and grade using fastener assemblies that are being installed in the work .
Perform calibration in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension by tightening three typical bolts of each diameter length and grade from the bolts being installed and with a hardened washer from the washers being used in the work under the element turned in tightening .
Recalibrate wrenches if significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts threads nuts and washers .
Verify during actual installation in the assembled steel work that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from snug tight greater than that specified in Table B .
If manual torque wrenches are used turn nuts in the tightening direction when torque is measured .
When calibrated wrenches are used to install and tension bolts in a connection install bolts with hardened washers under the element turned in tightening bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition .
Following this initial tightening operation tighten the connection using the calibrated wrench .
Tighten the bolts by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
Use the wrench to again tighten previously tightened bolts that may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tightening of adjacent bolts until all bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount .
.f Installation of Alternate Design Bolts .
When fasteners that incorporate a design feature intended to indirectly indicate the bolt tension or to automatically provide the tension specified in Table A and that have been qualified under Section .c.c .
are to be installed check a representative sample of not less than three bolts of each diameter length and grade at the job site in a device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Include flat hardened washers in the test assembly if required in the actual connection arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned .
Use the calibration test to demonstrate that each bolt develops a tension not less than greater than the tension specified in Table A .
Follow the manufacturers installation procedure for installation of bolts in the calibration device and in all connections .
Perform periodic retesting when ordered by the Representative .
When alternate design fasteners that are intended to control or indicate bolt tension of the fasteners are used install bolts in all holes of the connection and initially tighten them sufficiently to bring all plies of the joint into firm contact but without yielding or fracturing the control or indicator element of the fasteners .
Then further tighten all fasteners progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened fasteners .
In some cases to properly tension the bolts perform more than .c .c Change No .
a single cycle of systematic partial tightening before final twistoff of the control or indicator element of individual fasteners .
Replace any individual fastener assembly if twist off occurs before the final tensioning cycle .
.g Direct Tension Indicator Tightening .
When tightening of bolts using DTI devices is used assemble a representative sample of not less than three devices for each diameter and grade of fastener to be used in the work in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Include flathardened washers in the test assembly if required in the actual connection arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned .
Use the calibration test to demonstrate that the device indicates a tension not less than greater than that specified in Table A .
After tightening in the calibrating device use a torque wrench to verify the torque required for proper tightening .
Tighten the nut of each assembly five degrees past the initial required tension record the respective load reading on the torque wrench dial and determine the average of the sample assemblies .
This average torque will be the inspection torque used on completed connections and is to be determined each day that inspection of completed connections is performed .
Follow manufacturers installation procedure for installation of bolts in the calibration device and in all connections .
Give special attention to proper installation of flathardened washers when DTI devices are used with bolts installed in oversize or slotted holes and when the load indicating devices are used under the turned element .
When bolts are installed using DTIs conforming to the requirements of ASTM F install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to snug tight conditions .
Snug tight is indicated by partial compression of the direct tension indicator protrusions .
Provide a maximum gap of .
inch after installation .
Then tighten all fasteners progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened fasteners .

Change No .
Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel .
No research work has been performed by the Research Council Riveted and Bolted Structural Joints to establish the turnofnut procedure if bolt lengths exceed diameters .
Therefore the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions .
In some cases proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than a single cycle of systematic partial tightening before final tightening to deform the protrusion to the specified gap .
.h LockPin and Collar Fasteners .
Install lockpin and collar fasteners using approved methods and procedures .
.i Inspection .
In the presence of the Inspector inspect the tightened bolts using a calibrated torque wrench .

Individually place three bolts of the same grade size and condition as those under inspection in a device calibrated to measure bolt tension .
Perform this calibration operation at least once each inspection day .
Provide a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt if washers are used on the structure .
If washers are not used on the structure furnish the material used in the tension measuring device which abuts the part turned of the same specification as that used on the structure .
In the calibrated device tighten each bolt to the specified tension by any convenient means .
Apply the calibrated torque wrench to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head five degrees approximately inch at a inch radius in the tightening direction .
Take the average of the torque required for all three bolts as the jobinspection torque .
For final acceptance of connections installed using highstrength bolts inspect minimum of the bolts in the connection using a calibrated torque wrench .
Select bolts to be inspected according to PTM No. . Then apply the jobinspection torque to each with the calibrated torque wrench turned in the tightening direction .
If this torque turns no bolt head or nut the bolts in the connection will be considered to be properly tightened .
But if the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts apply the jobinspection torque to all bolts in the connection .
Tighten and reinspect any bolt whose head or nut turns at this stage or retighten all the bolts in the connection and resubmit it for inspection. . Pin Connections .
Use pilot and driving nuts in driving pins .
Drive pins so that the members will take full bearing on them .
Screw pin nuts up tight and burr the threads at the face of the nut with a pointed tool. . Misfits .

Materials .
.a General .
Do not heat straighten or heat curve steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum yield point greater than pounds per square inch without approval .
.b .
High Performance Steel .
Section .a.a .
Use procedures approved by the Chief Structural Materials Engineer when applying short term application of heat to High Performance Steel for heat curving heat straightening or camber and sweep adjustments .
Limit heat to F maximum unless otherwise approved . .
Type of Heating .
Curve beams and girders by either continuous or Vtype heating unless otherwise approved .
.a Continuous Heating .
For the continuous method heat a strip or intermittent strips along the edge of the top and bottom flange approximately simultaneously depending on flange widths and thicknesses .
Use a strip of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
.a .a Change No .
.b Vtype Heating .
For the Vtype heating heat the top and bottom flanges in truncated triangular or wedge shaped areas having their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
Use the spacing and temperature necessary to obtain the required curvature and to allow heating to progress along the top and bottom at approximately the same rate .
Terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface just before the junction of the web and the flange is reached .
When heating the inside flange surface the surfaces that intersect the web do not apply heat directly to the web .
If the radius of curvature is feet or more extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
If the radius of curvature is less than feet extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to oneeighth of the flange or inches whichever is less .
For the truncated triangular pattern provide an included angle of approximately to degrees but do not exceed inches for the base of the triangle .
Do not make variations in the patterns prescribed above unless permitted .
For both types of heating heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .
Heat both the inside and outside flange surfaces only if the flange thickness is inches or greater .
Heat the two surfaces concurrently. . Geometric Limitations for Heat Curving .

Do not artificially cool the girder until after it naturally cools to F. Obtain approval for the method of artificial cooling . .
Position for Heating .
Heatcurve the girder with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
If curved in the vertical position brace or support the girder in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heatcurving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
If curved in the horizontal position support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points as necessary to obtain a uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder to exceed the usual allowable design stress .
Maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling. . Sequence of Operations .
Heatcurve the girder in the fabrication shop before it is painted .
Conduct the heat curving operation either before or after all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed .
However unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage locate and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required heatcurve or oxygencut them separately and then weld them to the curved girder .
When cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams attach them before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than inches and the radius of curvature is greater than feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates heatcurve the beams before the cover plates are attached either heatcurve or oxygencut cover plates separately then weld them to the curved beam. . Camber .
Camber girders before heat curving .
Obtain camber for rolled beams using approved heatcambering or cold cambering methods .
For plate girders cut the web to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heatcurving .
However if permitted correct moderate deviations from specified camber by a carefully supervised application of heat .
Correct deviations from the specified camber according to Publication . .
Measurement of Curvature and Camber .
Measure horizontal curvature and vertical camber after all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
Check horizontal curvature with the girder in the vertical position .

Ensure uniform appearance and color .
The Departments representative will inspect repairs .
Maintain a minimum F environment until the repaired areas have cured .
If at any time during the curing period the curing temperature falls below F the Departments representative will consider the work deficient and will reject the work .
Before patching clean holes left by tie rods strand holddown devices recessed strand pockets or other temporary inserts .
Use a hammer to pack the holes with stiff dry mortar of the same material used in the concrete .
Fill surface blemishes on the outside fascia beam surfaces with mortar as specified in Section .d .
.g Curing Concrete .
Cure and protect concrete until prestress transfer has been accomplished .
Construct and maintain a suitable curing enclosure to retain heat and moisture around the beams .
Do not use membrane curing .
The full concrete curing cycle consists of the initial curing phase the intermediate curing phase and the final curing phase .
.g .
Initial Curing Phase .
The initial curing phase begins when each beam is completely covered with saturated covering .
After each beam has been cast and immediately after the concrete has initially set cover exposed surfaces using a double thickness of saturated burlap or cotton or jute mats .
Place covering carefully to avoid damaging the concrete .
During the initial curing phase which extends over a period of not less than hours or more than the time required to achieve initial set apply artificial heat if necessary to maintain the temperature at approximately F within the enclosure .
.g .
Intermediate Curing Phase .
Cure beams using either steam curing or saturated cover curing .
Maintain curing for hours or until at least one hour after the required transfer strength is attained whichever is greater .
An additional hour of curing is not required if the transfer strength is attained after hours .
.g .. a Steam Curing .
Raise the temperature within the enclosure to between F and F at a rate not exceeding F per hour .
Use steam of relative humidity .
Ensure full circulation between the beams and the enclosure .
Do not direct steam jets onto forms or beams .
.g .. b Saturated Cover Curing .
Raise the temperature within the enclosure and the temperature of the covering material to between F and F at a rate not exceeding F per hour .
Keep the covering thoroughly saturated throughout the curing process .
Use water with a temperature that is not more that F from the enclosure temperature .
Control the temperature of the water to maintain a uniform enclosure temperature at the beam surface .
Forms may be removed after hours provided saturated cover curing is continued on all beam surfaces up to the time of transfer .
.g .. c Record of Curing Temperatures .
Record curing temperatures for the full curing cycle up to removal of beams from the bed .
Provide one continuous record chart of curing temperatures for every feet of casting bed .
Use accurate automatic recording devices with temperature pickup devices properly placed either within the curing enclosure or embedded in the beam .
Locate the temperature pickup devices away from direct contact with steam or water jets .
If enclosures are removed to facilitate form removal place any nonembedded pickup devices on top of a inch board directly on the saturated covering and overlay three additional layers of saturated covering .
If embedded probes must be temporarily disconnected from the beam during this process reattach immediately .
Mark the curing chart to indicate the point at which this change of pickup location is made .
Use recording charts covering a minimum of hours and a maximum of hours per one full revolution or as otherwise permitted .
Record beam number shop drawing number date start time and time concrete placement was completed and time of prestress transfer on the chart .
Every year certify the accuracy of the recording device .
Display the certificate with the recorder .
Place the recorder so the chart may be observed at all times during the curing cycle .
After completion of curing submit the charts to the InspectorinCharge .
.g .
Final Curing Phase .
This phase consists of prestress transfer and beam storage .
.d .e Change No .
Following prestress transfer lower the enclosure temperature to F at a rate not exceeding F per hour until ambient temperature is reached .
Conduct transfer of prestress as specified in Section .d.h .
Store beams as specified in Section .f for a minimum of hours .
.h Transfer of Prestress .
Do not transfer prestress before the specified concrete strength has been attained .
Retain the saturated covering on the top and sides of the beams and continue curing until final prestress transfer is complete .
Transfer prestress as specified in Section .c.i .
Transfer prestress not later than days after casting provided the minimum specified concrete strength at transfer has been reached .
If this strength has not been reached the Representative will declare the concrete deficient in strength and may reject the deficient member .

Protect bar tendons from corrosion at the job site by spraying with a rust preventative and by use of an approved protective covering over the bars .
c Anchorages and Bearing Devices .
Use permanenttype anchorages to secure prestressing steel at the ends .
Steel distribution plates or assemblies may be omitted if large enough anchorages are used in conjunction with a steel grill embedded in the concrete to effectively distribute the compressive stresses to the concrete .
For all systems of posttensioning set each anchorage device in all directions perpendicular to the prestressing steel axis .
At both tendon ends make accurate measurements of anchorage loss due to slippage or other causes .
Compare these losses with the assumed losses shown in the posttensioning schedule on the shop drawings .

After the prestressing steel has been installed do not weld or ground for welding equipment on steel in the member .
Do not flame cut unless the ducts and tendons are effectively shielded .
e Prestressing .
Tension prestressing steel using hydraulic jacks so the force in the prestressing steel is not less than the value indicated or on the accepted shop drawings with appropriate allowance for all losses .
Within days before stressing calibrate all jacks and pressure gauge system and furnish certified copies of the load calibration curves to the Engineer except jack calibration for post tensioning of box culverts and adjacent box beams .
For post tensioning of box culverts and adjacent box beams accompany jack gages with a current certified calibration chart not older than months .
Equip each jack with a pressure gage having an accurate reading dial at least inches in diameter .
Calibrate each jack and its gage as a unit with the cylinder extension in the approximate position it will be in at final jacking force .
Recalibrate stressing equipment at month intervals and at other times when required .
Do not interchange jacks and gauges without recalibration .
Check the certified calibration chart for hydraulic jacks and pressure gages used for tensioning prestressing steel both before and during tensioning operations .
Do not stress tendons until the concrete has attained its day strength unless partial stressing is allowed at a lower strength .
Apply to the tendon an initial load of of the full load to take up slack and to provide a starting point for measurement of elongations .
Apply the final load including any overload .
Apply the load at a rate consistent with procedures recommended by the manufacturer of the system .
Unless otherwise indicated in simple span members stress by jacking from one end only with onehalf of the prestressing steel in each member tensioned from one end and the other onehalf tensioned from the opposite end .
When the same tendons are jacked from two ends both jacking operations may be done simultaneously provided uniform tensioning forces are applied at each end .
The stressing forces measured by jacking pressures and elongation are required to agree within .
If the measurements can not be reconciled within this range halt the stressing examine the procedure and determine the sources of error so the measured force can be verified within this limit .
If sources of error can not be determined or verified by the Professional Engineer in charge of posttensioning operations to the satisfaction of the Engineer the posttensioning of the member will be stopped and the member rejected .
In continuous members tension by jacking at each tendon end unless otherwise indicated .
Jacking of both ends need not be done simultaneously unless otherwise indicated .
f Bonding and Grouting .
Start grouting promptly after tensioning. . Grout .
Use grout consisting of Portland cement water and admixtures .

Section .a Appendix A Metric SI Information A Initial Edition APPENDIX A METRIC SI INFORMATION General This Appendix provides guidance on the selection of metric SI units and how they relate to their counterparts in English or IP units .
Topics include definitions dual units conversion rules basic units of measure commonly used SI prefixes SI measurements and conversion tables .
The conversion tables show multiplication values to change IP units to SI units .
Several additional tables in this Appendix provide specific IP SI relationships .
These tables include Table A. mm Equivalents of American Wire Gage Table A. NEMA Metric Non Metallic and Metallic Conduit and Fittings Table A .
Reinforcing Bar Information Table A .
Standard Test Sieves U.S.A. Standard Sieves Definitions Important terms include the following SI UnitsUnits belonging to the International System of Units which is abbreviated SI as interpreted or modified for use in the United States by the Secretary of Commerce .
English or IP UnitsUnits based upon the yard and the pound commonly used in the United States and defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
Soft ConversionAn IP measurement that is mathematically converted to its exact SI equivalent .
Example Lane Width feet IP .
m SI .
Hard ConversionA close approximation of the IP unit but is rounded logically in the SI system .
Example Lane Width feet IP or .
m SI .
SI Base UnitsThe SI system consists of seven base units of measurement six of which are used in design and construction .
The seventh mole is the amount of molecular substance and is used in physics .
Quantity Unit Symbol length mass time electric current temperature luminous intensity meter kilogram second ampere kelvin candela m kg s A K cd SI Derived UnitsDerived units are formed by combining base units supplementary units and other derived units according to the algebraic relations linking the corresponding quantities .
The symbols for derived units are obtained by means of the mathematical signs for multiplication division and use of exponents .
See the list entitled Basic Units of Measure for examples of SI derived units .
Appendix A Metric SI Information A Initial Edition Dual Units Wherever possible measurements in these Specifications are stated in dual unitsSI units followed by IP units in parentheses .
Dual units may be found in references to SI or dual unit codes and standards e.g .
ASTM AASHTO etc ..
In other situations where references to other sources are not available logical Conversion Rules are applied .
Many SI measurements in these Specifications are soft conversions of the IP measurements .
Over time these SI measurements will be changed through the consensus process into hard conversionsrationalized rounded SI dimensions of the IP measurements .
Certain situations do occur where specifications are stated in SI units only or in IP units only .
These situations may occur when Existing specifications have not been fully converted .
The specification was developed exclusively using IP units only or SI units only .
i.e .
Specified products may be available exclusively in SI sizes or IP sizes .
Conversion Rules The Metric Guide for Federal Construction published by the National Institute of Building Sciences provides further direction about developing specifications .
The publication presents Conversion Rules which aids in developing construction specifications .
The Conversion Rules include the following Use ASTM E Standard Practice for the Use of Metric SI Units in Building Design and Construction as a basic reference .
Follow the rules for usage conversion and rounding in IEEEASTM SI Standard for Use of International System of Units SI The Modern Metric System Annex B or ANSIIEEE American National Standard Metric Practice Sections .
and .
Wherever possible convert measurements to rounded rationalized hard SI numbers .
For instance if anchor bolts are to be imbedded to a depth of inches the exact converted length i.e .
soft conversion of mm might be rounded to either mm .
inches or mm .
inches .
The less critical the number the rounder it can be but ensure that allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded .
When in doubt stick with the exact soft conversion .
Round to preferred SI numbers i.e .
hard conversion .
While the preferred numbers for the foot inches system are in order of preference those divisible by and preferred SI numbers are in order of preference those divisible by and or decimal multiples thereof .
Use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert IPs to SI .
They are readily available and are indispensable to the conversion process .
Simply check with any store or catalogue source that sells calculators or software .
Be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes SI numbers can be significantly larger than IP numbers a cubic meter for instance is one billion cubic millimeters .

The apparent next lowest bidder will be notified by email to electronically submit evidence of such commitments by accessing the Departments ECMS website to complete and submit the DBE Minority Participation and Commitment by P.M. prevailing local time within five calendar days after notification .
c Good Faith Effort Requirements .
The demonstration of GFEs is accomplished by seeking out DBE participation in the project given all relevant circumstances .
The following illustrate the types of efforts that may be taken but they are not deemed to be exclusive or exhaustive for more guidance on GFE requirements refer to CFR Part Appendix C. The Director andor Committee will consider other factors and types of efforts that may be relevant Efforts made to conduct market research to identify small business contractors and suppliers and solicit through all reasonable and available means e.g .
use of the DBE Directory attendance at prebid meetings advertising andor written notices the interest of all certified DBEs who have the capability to perform the work of the contract .
The bidder should provide written notification at least calendar days before the bid opening to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation .
The bidder must determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations .
Efforts made to select portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the DBE goal will be achieved .
This includes where appropriate breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces .
Efforts made to provide interested DBEs with adequate information about the plans specifications and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation .
Efforts made to negotiate in good faith with interested DBEs .
It is the bidders responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and suppliers so as to facilitate DBE participation .
Evidence of such negotiation includes the names addresses and telephone numbers of DBEs that were considered a description of the information provided regarding the plans and Appendix C Designated Special Provision DSP C Change No .
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for DBEs to perform the work .
A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors including DBE subcontractors and would take a firms price and capabilities as well as contract DBE goals into consideration .
However the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidders failure to meet the contract DBE goal as long as such costs are reasonable .
Also the ability or desire of a bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own work force does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make a GFE .
Bidders are not however required to accept quotes from DBEs if the price difference is too high or unreasonable .
Bidders determination of a DBE as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities .
The contractors standing within its industry membership in specific groups organizations or associations and political or social affiliations for example union vs. nonunion employee status are not legitimate causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids in the contractors efforts to meet the contract DBE goal .
Another practice considered an inadequate GFE is the rejection of a DBE because its quotation for the work was not the lowest received .
However nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the bidder or prime contractor to accept unreasonable quotes in order to satisfy the contract DBE goal .
Efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining bonding lines of credit or insurance .
Efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining necessary equipment supplies materials or related assistance or services .
Efforts to effectively use the services of the Departments DBE Supportive Services Center services of the Departments SBE Supportive Services Center services of available minoritywomen community organizations minoritywomen contractors groups local State and Federal minoritywomen business assistance offices and other organizations as allowed on a casebycase basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBEs .

A prime contractors inability to find a replacement DBE at the contract price is not in and of itself adequate to support a finding that GFEs have been made to replace the original DBE .
The fact that the prime contractor has the ability andor desire to perform the contract work with its own forces does not relieve the prime contractor of the obligation to make GFEs to find a replacement DBE and it is not a sound basis for rejecting a prospective replacement DBEs reasonable quote .
