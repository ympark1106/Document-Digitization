Measurement of Quantities reads as follows a General Requirements All measurements of work completed under the contract will be according to the English System unless otherwise specified .
The standard measures shown in this publication are primarily in the English System of Units such as feet and inches pounds gallons and acres .
Any metric equivalents shown in parentheses are intended only for those contracts in which they are specified or to maintain consistency with industry standards .
No guarantee is provided explicit or implicit that the units are accurate conversions .
The following general notes and table are provided to assist you in becoming familiar with the metric system .

This is a formula and not a multiplier .
The Fahrenheit temperature is substituted for F in the formula to attain the Celsius temperature .
Conversion from Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperature may be made by substituting the Celsius temperature for C in the formula .
x C . This is an exact conversion .
Angles will continue to be measured in degrees minutes and seconds instead of radians .
vi GENERAL NOTES .
The SI unit of millimeter should be used to convert inches to millimeters . .
The SI unit of Mass is the Kilogram Kg which should be used for smaller masses expressed in pounds .
The megagram Mg should be used for larger masses expressed in tons. . All units peculiar to the various cgs systems measurement systems constructed by using the centimeter gram and second as base units are to be avoided . .
In commercial and everyday use the term weight nearly always means mass thus when one speaks of a persons weight the quantity referred to is mass .
In Science and Technology the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that if applied to the body would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall g acceleration of gravity .
When the term is used it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use SI Units properly by using Kilograms for Mass or Newtons for Force .
The use of force of gravity mass times acceleration of gravity instead of weight with this meaning is recommended .
Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear . .
The term load means either mass or force depending on its use .
A load that produces a vertically downward force because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units .
Any other load is expressed in force units. . A quantity stated as limits such as not more than or maximum must be handled so that the stated limit is not violated . .
Conversion of quantities should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between the accuracy of the data and the given number of digits .
In all conversions the number of significant digits retained should be such that accuracy is neither sacrificed nor exaggerated .
For example a length of ft converts exactly to .
m. If however the ft length has been obtained by rounding to the nearest ft the conversion should be given as m. The proper conversion procedure is to multiply a value by a conversion factor that is more accurate than is required the result is then rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits. . For calculation of results avoid rounding of intermediate quantities .
For reporting results the rule for addition and subtraction is that the answer shall contain no significant digits farther to the right than occur in the least precise number .
The rule for multiplication and division is that the product or quotient vii shall contain no more significant digits than are contained in the number with the fewest significant digits used in the multiplication . .
When a figure is to be rounded to fewer digits than the total number available the standard up procedures should be used as follows a When the first digit discarded is less than the last digit retained should not be changed .
For example .
if rounded to three digits would be .
if rounded to two digits would be .. b When the first digit discarded is or greater the last digit retained should be increased by one unit .
For example .
if rounded to three digits would be .
if rounded to two digits would be .. .
Refer to ASTM SI American National Standard for Use of the International System of Units SI for other conversion factors . .
This specification book uses the word shall to describe the Contractors responsibilities .
The word will is used to describe the Departments responsibilities .
The words shall and will are not required to be followed by the words by the Contractor or by the Department to retain these meanings .

Subsequent plan changes affecting the modified work items but not related to the CRI proposal will be excluded from such determination .
Upon completion of all work included in the CRI proposal the final total net savings will be determined by comparing the cost of the work based on the .
original contract quantities with the cost of the actual CRI proposal work performed .
In determining the savings the Department reserves the right to consider other factors in addition to the contract bid prices and proposed unit prices if in the judgment of the Department such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be deleted from or added to the contract .
The net savings of a CRI proposal to reduce contract time will be determined by multiplying the number of days saved by the daily liquidated damages as set forth in Section .
