Definitions .
The following definitions apply to segmental bridge construction .
Segment A modular section of the superstructure andor substructure consisting of a certain crosssection shape and length as detailed in the Plans . .
Match Cast A precast concrete fabrication process whereby a segment is cast against the preceding segment producing a matching interface which permits the reestablishment of the cast geometry at erection time .
Match casting is accomplished by either the short line or long line casting method. . Short Line Casting Casting segments one at a time in a casting cell between a bulkhead at one end and a previously cast segment at the other .
The first segment is cast between the bulkhead and another temporary bulkhead. . Long Line Casting Casting segments on a casting bed of sufficient length to permit the cumulative casting of segments for the entire length of a span or cantilever between field closure pours without repositioning the segments on the casting bed .
With this method the first segment is cast between bulkheads and successive segments are cast between a movable bulkhead on one end and the previously cast segment on the other . .
Casting Cell A special formwork arrangement usually consisting of a fixed vertical bulkhead of the cross section shape at one end and adjustable soffit side and core forms all designed and assembled into a machine for making a single superstructure segment .
A casting cell for a substructure pier shaft segment consists of exterior and interior side forms and a soffit form of the cross section shape . .
Wet Joint System Where segments are made in a casting cell between two bulkheads and are not match cast .
The segments are then erected in the superstructure with a narrow castinplace joint between each segment .
During erection all the segments of a span or Return to Table of Contents multiple spans are supported by falsework truss or other technique until the joints have gained strength and the longitudinal posttensioning installed to make them self supporting. . Span By Span Erection Placing a specified number of segments on a temporary support system aligned and posttensioned longitudinally forming a completed span of the superstructure . .
Balanced Cantilever Erection The segments are sequentially erected alternately on either side of the pier in cantilever to a point where a closure is castinplace. . Progressive Cantilever Erection The segments are erected progressively in cantilever in one direction from one pier to the next using temporary intermediate piers or other systems as required to support the advancing cantilever between piers . .
Casting Curve The curve of casting geometry that has to be followed in the casting cell or bed for achieving the theoretical bridge profile and alignment after all the final structural and time dependent creep and shrinkage deformations have taken place .
The casting curve is a combination of the theoretical bridge geometrical profile grade alignment and the camber. . Camber The amount by which the concrete profile at casting time must differ from the theoretical geometric profile grade to compensate for all structural dead load posttensioning all long term and time dependent deformations creep and shrinkage including all the intermediate erection stages and effects .
The opposite of deflections. . Erection Elevation The elevation at which a segment is set in the structure at the time it is erected .
This is profile grade corrected by the amount of deflection calculated to occur from that stage onwards .

Do not use a temporary casing larger than inches of the shaft diameter .
Fill the oversized temporary casing with drilled shaft concrete at no additional expense to the Department .
Withdraw the surface casing after concrete placement .
The Engineer may require predrilling with slurry andor overreaming to the outside diameter of the casing to install the surface casing at some sites .
For drilled shafts installed to support sign signal lighting and ITS structures provide temporary surface casings from at least foot above the ground surface to at least feet below the ground surface .
For sign signal lighting and ITS structure foundations located within permanent sidewalks or within feet of curb sections provide temporary surface casings from no lower than the top of sidewalk to at least feet below the ground surface .
For drilled shafts installed to support sign signal lighting and ITS structures do not attempt to excavate the shaft using plain water or natural slurry .
Do not attempt to excavate the shaft using dry construction method unless specifically indicated in the Plans or approved by the Engineer. . Dry Construction Method Use the dry construction method only at sites where the ground water table and soil conditions generally stiff to hard clays or rock above the water table make it feasible to construct the shaft in a relatively dry excavation and where the sides and bottom of the shaft are stable and may be visually inspected by the Engineer prior to placing the concrete .
In applying the dry construction method drill the shaft excavation remove accumulated seepage water and loose material from the excavation and place the shaft concrete in a relatively dry excavation .
Use the dry construction method only when shaft excavations as demonstrated in a test hole have inches or less of seepage water accumulated over a four hour period the sides and bottom remain stable without detrimental caving sloughing or swelling for a four hour period and the loose material and water can be satisfactorily removed prior to inspection and prior to placing concrete .
Use the wet construction method or the temporary casing construction method for shafts that do not meet the requirements for the dry construction method . .
Wet Construction Method Use the wet construction method at all sites where it is impractical to provide a dry excavation for placement of the shaft concrete .
The wet construction method consists of keeping the shaft excavation filled with fluid mineral slurry polymer slurry natural slurry or water desanding and cleaning the slurry and final cleaning of the excavation by means of a bailing bucket air lift submersible pump or Return to Table of Contents other approved devices and placing the shaft concrete with a tremie or concrete pump extending to the shaft bottom which displaces the water or slurry during concreting of the shaft excavation .
Where drilled shafts are located in open water areas construct the shafts by the wet method using exterior casings extending from above the water elevation into the ground to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete .
Install the exterior casing in a manner that will produce a positive seal at the bottom of the casing so that there is no intrusion or extrusion of water or other materials into or from the shaft excavation . .
Temporary Casing Construction Method Use the temporary casing method at all sites where it is inappropriate to use the dry or wet construction methods without the use of temporary casings other than surface casings .
In this method the casing is advanced prior to excavation and withdrawn after concrete placement .
When a formation is reached that is nearly impervious seal in the nearly impervious formation .
Proceed with drilling as with the wet method to the projected depth .
Proceed with the placement of the concrete as with the dry method .
In the event seepage conditions prevent use of the dry method complete the excavation and concrete placement using wet methods .
Where drilling through materials having a tendency to cave advance the excavation by drilling in a mineral or polymer slurry .
In the event that a caving layer or layers are encountered that can not be controlled by slurry install temporary removable casing through such caving layer or layers .
The Engineer may require overreaming to the outside diameter of the casing .
Take whatever steps are required to prevent caving during shaft excavation including installation of deeper casings .
If electing to remove a casing and replace it with a longer casing through caving soils backfill the excavation .
The Contractor may use soil previously excavated or soil from the site to backfill the excavation .
The Contractor may use other approved methods which will control the size of the excavation and protect the integrity of the foundation soils to excavate through caving layers .
Before withdrawing the casing ensure that the level of fresh concrete is at such a level that the fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward .
As the casing is withdrawn maintain the level of concrete within the casing so that fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward out of the shaft excavation without mixing with or displacing the shaft concrete .
The Contractor may use the casing method when approved by the Engineer to construct shafts through weak caving soils that do not contribute significant shaft shear resistance .
In this case place a temporary casing through the weak caving soils before beginning excavation .
Conduct excavation using the dry construction method where appropriate for site conditions and the wet construction method where the dry construction method is not appropriate .
Withdraw the temporary casing during the concreting operations unless the Engineer approves otherwise . .
Permanent Casing Construction Method Use the permanent casing method when required by the Plans .
In this method place a casing to the prescribed depth before beginning excavation .
If the Contractor can not attain full penetration the Engineer may direct the Contractor to excavate through the casing and advance the casing until reaching the desired penetration .
In some cases the Engineer may require the Contractor to overream to the outside diameter of the casing before placing the casing .
Return to Table of Contents Construct the shaft in accordance with .
except for cutting the casing off at the prescribed elevation upon reaching the proper construction sequence and leaving the remainder of the casing in place .
