When weathering steel is specified or used all faying surfaces of connections shall be blast cleaned to a nearwhite finish in accordance with SSPC SP immediately prior to assembling connections in the field .
d. All fasteners shall have a hardened washer under the element turned in tightening .
For installations utilizing ASTM A bolts where the steel work comprising the grip has a specified yield strength less than ksi special requirements for hardened washers will be noted on the contract .
When the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis a smooth hardened beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack of parallelism .
In the normal installation the direct tension indicator shall be placed on the bolt with the protrusions bearing against the underside of the bolt head .
For this type installation the nut is the turned element and the hardened washer will be placed between the steelwork and the nut .
If required due to bolt entering and wrench operation clearances it will be permissible to use the bolt head as the turned element .
In this type installation a hardened washer shall be placed under the bolt head and the direct tension indicator placed on the bolt with its protrusions bearing against the hardened washer .
In those installations where inspection of the bolt head is too difficult it will be permissible to place the direct tension indicator at the nut end .

A hardened washer is then placed on the bolt against the protrusions and the nut is installed .
With this type installation the nut is the turned element .

For those type installations where the direct tension indicator is used adjacent to a hardened round washer some slight movement of the hardened round washer is acceptable .

All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened progressing systematically from the center most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
When tightening the element not turned shall be held with a hand wrench to prevent rotation .
The gap between the bolt head and the face of the direct tension indicator is reduced while tensioning due to the bolt clamping force which flattens the washer protrusions .
When tightening complete closure of the gap around the circumference should be avoided to prevent over tightening the bolt .
The gap may not be uniform around the circumference of the direct tension indicator as the wrench may pull the bolt off center in the hole resulting in nonuniform compression of the protrusions .
When nonuniform gap exists the average gap criteria is satisfied if the gap measured at several points around the circumference shows of the measurements to be equal to or less than the value specified in Section .
G .. b .
If there is no gap at only one point on the circumference the bolt is properly tightened and no further tightening shall be attempted .
Impact wrenches shall be of adequate capacity to perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately seconds .

The Contractor shall supply the Engineer with an identical gauge for inspection .
After all bolts in a joint have been tightened the Contractor shall return to the first bolts tightened to assure that they have not loosened .
Lost tension may be restored by tightening so that the gap is slightly less than originally measured .
STEEL STRUCTURES Page f. In order to determine acceptability of direct tension indicators the Engineer shall Sample and test the direct tension indicators in accordance with SD .
The cost for the bolts and direct tension indicators used for field verification shall be incidental to the cost for the structural steel .
Have full opportunity to witness installation of bolted connections and shall periodically observe the installation and tightening operation to ensure that proper procedures are being adhered to .
Determine that all bolts have been tightened upon completion of a bolted joint .
A minimum of but not less than four bolts in each joint shall be inspected with a metal feeler gauge .
If all gaps checked are within the allowable distance described the joint shall be accepted as properly tightened .
If gaps checked are in excess of that specified the Contractor shall reinspect and retighten each bolt in the joint as required and resubmit the joint for inspection .
The metal feeler gauge shall be used as a no go inspection tool by inserting the tapered nose of the gauge into the openings between protrusions .
If the gauge does not reach the shaft of the bolt but a gap is evident the installation is acceptable .
g. The turnofnut method for bolt tightening may be used when specified in the plans .
When the turnofnut installation method is specified hardened washers are not required except as specified in Section .
G .. d. A sufficient number of bolts shall first be placed in the joint and snugged to insure that all faying surfaces are in firm contact prior to tightening .
Snug tight is defined as the tightness attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary wrench .
Bolts shall be placed in any remaining holes and snugged tight as erection bolts or pins are removed .
All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened the amount shown in Table progressing systematically from the center most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
When tightening the element not turned shall be held with a hand wrench to prevent rotation .
STEEL STRUCTURES Page Table Nut Rotation from Snugged Condition Geometry of Outer Faces of Bolted Parts Bolt Length Measured From Underside of Head to End of Bolt Both Faces Normal to Bolt Axis One Face Normal to Bolt Axis and Other Face Sloped Not More Than Bevel Washer Not Used Both Faces Sloped Not More Than From Normal to Bolt Axis Bevel Washers Not Used Up to and including diameters turn turn turn Over diameters but not exceeding diameters turn turn turn Over diameters but not exceeding diameters turn turn turn Nut rotation is relative to bolt regardless of the element nut or bolt being turned .
For bolts installed by turn and less the tolerance is plus or minus degrees for bolts installed by turn and more the tolerance is plus or minus degrees .
Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel .
No research work has been performed by the Research Council Riveted and Bolted Structural Joints to establish the turnofnut procedure when bolt lengths exceed diameters .
Therefore the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions. . Pin Connections Pilot and driving nuts shall be used in driving pins .
They shall be furnished by the Contractor without charge to the Department .
Pins shall be driven so the members will take full bearing on them .
Pin nuts shall be screwed up tight and the threads burred at the face of the nut with a pointed tool. . Misfits When approved by the Departments Bridge Construction Engineer the correction of minor misfits involving harmless amounts of reaming or grinding will be considered a legitimate part of the erection .
