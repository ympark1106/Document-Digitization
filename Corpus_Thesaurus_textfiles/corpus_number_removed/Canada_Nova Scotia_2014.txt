DESCRIPTION This specification applies to the final lift surface course of all newly placed asphalt concrete pavement where the following conditions are met i .
The contract documents do not include a smoothness specification exemption for the section of roadway under contract .
ii .
The contract contains one or more individual sections equal to or exceeding metres in length .
iii .
The contract includes at least two opportunities for the Contractor to improve smoothness one of which is the surface asphalt lift with acceptable minimum thickness as define in Section .. iv .
The final lift surface course is placed between April th and December st .
If The Work consists of only one opportunity for the Contractor to improve smoothness e.g .
a single lift of asphalt concrete pavement over an existing asphalt surface the specification shall be applicable only if the section of roadway has a preconstruction IRI value less than .
mmm as measured by the Department or their representative provided that conditions i ii and iv as stated above have been met. . DEFINITIONS .
Roadway Smoothness Category .
In the contract documents the smoothness category that applies for a particular section of roadway will be classified as either Category A Category B or Category C. The category defined will apply to the entire section of roadway under contract .
Roadway categories are determined solely at the Departments discretion based on a number of factors including but not necessarily limited to roadway classification geometry access points intersections driveways and the presence of other physical features that may impact the ability to achieve pavement smoothness. . International Roughness Index IRI .
IRI is a statistical measurement used to determine the amount of roughness in a measured longitudinal profile .
IRI shall be measured in mmm and reported to two decimal places for all procedures relating to this specification. . Preconstruction IRI .
The preconstruction IRI refers to the overall average IRI for the sections of original roadway under contract .
Preconstruction IRI measurements will be made by the Department or its designated representative prior to tendering . .
Opportunities to Improve Pavement Smoothness .
Opportunities for a Contractor to improve pavement smoothness shall include the following a new lift of asphalt concrete pavement with minimum thickness equal to or greater than x the nominal aggregate size exclusive of tolerances on EPS contracts an asphalt concrete levelling course cold planing pulverization gravelling gravel or RAP interlayer sandwich asphalt concrete recycling . .
Reporting Interval .
The reporting interval for this specification shall be metres for overall IRI and metres for localized roughness . .
Localized Roughness .
Localized roughness is reported in metre intervals where the IRI exceeds an established value as set out in Table .
of this specification for a particular roadway category . .
Segment .
A segment of Roadway shall be defined by the full lane width including paved shoulders over a defined length .
The segment length shall be metres for localized roughness .
The segment length shall be metres for overall IRI however shorter segment lengths may exist as outlined in Item .. . Project Chainage .
The distance as measured by the High Speed Profiler will be referenced to the contract stake chainage but will be the only chainage deemed accurate and acceptable for the smoothness specification. . REFERENCES All reference standards shall be current issue or latest revision at the first date of Tender advertisement .
This specification refers to the following standards specifications or publications ASTM E Standard Test Method for Measuring the Longitudinal Profile of Traveled Surfaces with an Accelerometer Established Inertial Profiling Reference NSTPW Standard Specification Highway Construction and Maintenance February and latest revisions Division Section NSTPW Standard Specification Highway Construction and Maintenance February and latest February H Appendix H Smoothness Specification revisions Division Section .
EQUIPMENT A Class inertial laser profiler with moving average filter high pass ft and low pass ft will be used for all smoothness measurements under this specification .
The equipment will be installed and operated in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and ASTM E . . SMOOTHNESS TESTING PROCEDURES The Department or its designated representative will conduct smoothness testing in accordance with ASTM E . The Departments smoothness testing results will be used in determining payment adjustments and areas requiring Corrective Work . .
Testing Schedule .
Smoothness testing will be conducted within calendar days following completion of final paving provided there are no situations present which restrict access to the test site with the profiler equipment .
Additional time may be required to conduct testing if weather conditions are unfavorable .
Efforts will be made to collect smoothness data within the day period however in the event of inclement weather smoothness testing may be delayed until conditions are favorable .
Such delays shall not constitute grounds for a claim from the Contractor . .
Profile Measurements .
The profiler will conduct three complete passes in each lane recording the right and left wheel path IRI values simultaneously at metre intervals .
The final IRI will be the average of the three passes reported at metre intervals .
The metre interval averages will then be computed from the metre interval average IRI values .
The point at skewed pavement locations where testing will start end will be the where the full pavement width occurs across all lanes including paved shoulders. . Exclusions .
The metre segments at both ends of the section under contract will be excluded from smoothness calculations .
Bridges underpass structures and overpass structures located within any metre segment including the metre segments immediately before and after the structure shall be excluded from payment adjustments under this specification .
Individual contract sections less than metres in length or areas requiring hand work tapers intersections gore areas aprons etc .
will be excluded from this specification .
Individual metre segments exhibiting roughness which can be directly attributed to physical features of the roadway including iron works or curbgutter matchins will be excluded from payment adjustments. . PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS The Engineer will provide the Contractor with a copy of the smoothness test results including detailed payment adjustment summaries and Compulsory Corrective Work requirements within calendar days of original smoothness testing. . Metre Segments .
Payment adjustments for metre segments will be calculated based on the overall average IRI in mmm for each metre segment in each lane in accordance with Table .. February H Appendix H Smoothness Specification Table .

The corresponding amount will be paid to the Contractor on the final estimate .
If the total metre segment payment adjustment is a negative value penalty the Contractor will be assessed either the total metre segment payment adjustment or the total localized roughness payment adjustment whichever is numerically less i.e .
whichever results in a greater penalty to the Contractor .
The two penalties shall not be applied in summation .
