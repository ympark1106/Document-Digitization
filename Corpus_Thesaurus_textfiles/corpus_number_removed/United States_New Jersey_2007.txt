d. Methods of Drilling and Blasting .
Presplitting .
Presplitting is a controlled blasting method for constructing a shear plane along a specified cut slope through the controlled use of explosives and accessories in properly aligned and spaced drill holes .
After removing the overburden and weathered rock drill slope holes for presplitting along the line and in the plane of the cut slope .
Drill slope holes between and inches in diameter .
Control operations to ensure that the drill holes do not deviate from the plane of the slope by more than inches and do not deviate within the plane of the slope by more than inches .
Ensure that the drilling equipment for drilling the presplit holes has mechanical devices affixed to accurately determine the angle at which the drill steel enters the rock .
The RE will not allow presplit hole drilling if these devices are either missing or inoperative .
Do not space slope holes more than feet on centers and adjust spacing as required to produce a uniform and stable shear plane between slope holes .
Under certain conditions to produce a uniform and stable shear plane the RE may also require auxiliary holes which are identical to the slope holes but are not loaded with explosives .
The Contractor may extend the length of the slope holes to the full depth of the cut to a maximum of feet if hole alignment is maintained .
Otherwise drill and blast slope holes in lifts .
If presplitting in lifts the RE will allow a maximum offset of inches to accommodate the drill head .
Arrange lifts so that the toe of the finished cut slope coincides with the toe of slope .
Before placing explosives or blasting agents ensure that the hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth .
Provide explosives for use in presplit holes with a maximum diameter less than the diameter of the presplit hole and ensure that explosives do not touch the side of the hole .
Use only standard explosives manufactured especially for presplitting in presplit holes unless otherwise approved .
Do not load bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in the presplit holes .
Use an amount of explosives in the presplit hole that produces the shearing without causing overbreak .
Ensure that the top of the load is far enough below the collar to avoid overbreak at the surface .
Extend the detonator cord downline from the collar to the bottom of the bore hole and from the collar to the detonator trunkline or electric blasting caps .
Prime the explosive charge according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of the commercial explosive or blasting agent .
If using fractional portions of standard explosive cartridges firmly affix them to the detonating cord so that the cartridges do not slip down the detonating cord or bridge across the hole .
Do not space fractional cartridges along the length of the detonating cord farther than inches on center .
Adjust spacing to give the desired results .
Assemble continuous column cartridge type of explosives used with detonating cord and affix them to the detonating cord according to the explosive manufacturers recommendations .
Provide a copy of these instructions to the RE .
The Contractor may make the bottom charge of a presplit hole larger than the line charges but not so large as to cause overbreak .
Place the top charge of the presplitting hole far enough below the collar and reduce the charge sufficiently to avoid overbreaking and heaving .
Stem the upper portion of presplit holes from the topmost charge to the hole collar .
Stemming materials shall consist of drill cutting or inch clean stone chips .
The Contractor does not need to stem below the topmost charge unless the Department determines that the rock is very seamy and incompetent in which case the Contractor may need to full stem such zones .
The Contractor may detonate presplit holes instantaneously or on short delays between each hole .
Ensure that delay detonating does not exceed milliseconds between holes .
Detonate presplit holes before detonating any production holes .
Extend presplitting a minimum of feet ahead of the production blasting limits but not more than feet beyond the exposed presplit face .
Production Blasting .
Production blasting is a method of drilling and blasting to produce a high degree of fragmentation of the rock mass to be excavated .
Drill the adjacent line of production holes inside the presplit lines so as to avoid damage to the presplit face .
If necessary the Contractor may drill the first line of production holes parallel to the presplit face to reduce overbreak of this face .
The Contractor may vary hole diameter spacing delay patterns explosives blasting agents and other variables to obtain a fragmentation acceptable to the RE provided that the existing presplit face is not damaged .

Ensure that the certified APCT is present during paving operations .
Ensure that an MTV independently delivers HMA from the HMA trucks to the HMA paver .
Before beginning ensure that the temperature of the screed on the HMA paver is heated to at least the laydown temperature of the HMA .
Using the MTVs and HMA pavers construct paving courses in lifts of at least times the nominal maximum aggregate size of the HMA being constructed .
Ensure that the grade and profile are maintained .
Where directed use HMA having a nominal maximum aggregate size of inch or less in transition run out areas .
On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make use of a paver impractical spread rake and lute HMA with hand tools .
For these areas dump spread and screed the HMA to obtain the required compacted thickness .
Construct joints as follows .
Longitudinal Joints .
Perform paving with the springloaded end plates of the paver in the down position .
The longitudinal joint in lift shall offset that in the lift immediately below by approximately inches .
Offset the joint in the surface course from the lane lines by inches .
When constructing a joint between lanes of opposing traffic offset the joint by inches into either lane .
a. Echelon Paving .
If a single paver does not spread the HMA the entire width of the roadway use or more pavers in echelon .
Ensure that the trailing paver follows within feet of the lead paver .
Extend the screed and end gate of the trailing paver inch over the uncompacted HMA placed by the lead paver .
Ensure that the uncompacted HMA elevation from the trailing paver is equal to that from the lead paver at the joint .
The Contractor may construct either a butt joint or a wedge joint .
Do not rake the joint .
b .
Cold Joint Paving .
If echelon paving is not possible construct the pavement using cold longitudinal joints .
When constructing the first lane compact so the line and grade of the edges of the HMA are not displaced .
Construct longitudinal joints parallel to the centerlines within a tolerance of inches per linear feet .
If this tolerance is not met trim or mill the edge of the HMA mat as necessary .
Before paving the abutting lane ensure longitudinal joints are free from dust and debris .
For surface course only uniformly apply polymerized joint adhesive to longitudinal cold joint .
Apply a inch thick coating of polymerized joint adhesive over the entire joint face .
Apply slowly to ensure an even coating thickness .
When maintaining traffic with a lift thickness greater than inches construct a wedge joint .
The RE will permit a butt joint for lift thickness inches or less when maintaining traffic or for lift thickness greater than inches when maintaining traffic is not required .
Maintain a uniform width and depth of overlapped material at all times .
Position the paver so that the HMA overlaps the edge of the lane previously placed by to inches .
Leave the material sufficiently high to allow for compaction .
Lute back overlapped material pushing the material off of the cold HMA and onto the hot HMA mat directly over the joint .
Remove excess material instead of broadcasting it across the new lift .
When compacted ensure that the new mat at the joint is even or slightly higher maximum inch than the previously placed adjoining mat .
If the newly compacted mat results in a depression at the joint of inch or more lower than the previously placed adjacent HMA lift suspend all paving operations until corrective action is taken to prevent reoccurrence. . Transverse Joints .
Construct transverse joints to provide a smooth riding surface .
When using a bulkhead to form the joint ensure that the bulkhead forms a straight line and vertical face .
If a bulkhead is not used to form the joint make the joint by sawing the compacted HMA for a sufficient distance behind the end of the placement to ensure full thickness and a smooth surface at the joint .
Remove the full lift thickness of HMA ahead of the sawed joint .
In either case paint the joint face with polymerized joint adhesive before the fresh material is placed against it .
Unless prohibited by field conditions cross roll to obtain thorough compaction of these joints .
F. Compacting .
Compact with the minimum number of rollers as specified in the Table Table .. Compaction Requirements Laydown Rate r ydday Minimum Number of Rollers r r r Orient the drive axles of the roller towards the paver during compaction operation .
Operate rollers at a slow uniform speed not exceeding miles per hour .
If necessary to prevent adhesion of the HMA to the rollers keep the wheels moistened with water mixed with very small quantities of detergent .
Begin compacting at the sides and progress gradually to the center .
On superelevated curves compact from the lower to the upper edge parallel to the centerline and uniformly overlap each preceding track until the entire surface has been compacted .
Continue rolling until roller marks are eliminated and the air voids conform to the specified requirements .
Along forms curbs headers walls and other places not accessible to the rollers compact the HMA by a vibratory drum compactor .
Remove and replace HMA that becomes loose broken or otherwise defective or that shows an excess or deficiency of asphalt binder material .
When paving in echelon keep the rollers for the first lane approximately inches from the unconfined edge adjacent to the second paving operation .
After HMA from the second paver is placed against the uncompacted edge of the mat from the first paver compact the HMA on both sides of the joint .
Prevent lateral or vertical displacement of the unconfined edge during the compaction operation .
Ensure that the edge of the drums of the rollers extends over the free edge of the mat by at least inches .
When compacting the butt or wedge joint while paving the adjacent lane place the roller on the newly placed HMA and overlap the joint by approximately inches .
If a test strip was not required establish a correlation between the nuclear density gauge and the cores as specified in C .. To adjust correlation with the thin lift nuclear density gauge take additional core every week during the paving operation .
The RE may approve additional coring with valid cause presented by the Contractor .
On a weekly basis provide results of both the nuclear density and core testing to the RE .
Provide core and nuclear density results that include the bulk specific gravity the maximum specific gravity according to AASHTO T and the percent air voids .
Failure to submit the core and nuclear density test results from the previous weeks paving will result in suspended paving operations .

Reuse excavated material as specified in A. E. Excavating .
Use the appropriate method for constructing drilled shafts as follows .
Dry Method .
Only use the dry method where the groundwater level and soil conditions allow construction of the drilled shaft in a relatively dry excavation and where the sides and bottom of the shaft may be visually inspected by the RE before placement of reinforcement and concrete .
The dry method will consist of drilling the shaft excavation removing any accumulated water and loose material from the excavation placing the reinforcement cage and concreting the shaft in less than inches of water . .
Wet Method .
Construct drilled shafts using the wet method where dry excavation can not be maintained .
The wet method will consist of using water or slurry as specified in G to maintain stability of the drilled shaft perimeter while excavating to finished depth placing the reinforcement cage and concreting the shaft .
The Contractor may use the static or circulation process of the wet method .
When the material encountered can not be drilled using conventional earth drilling tools and equipment provide rock drilling equipment including air tools approved blasting materials and other equipment as necessary to construct the shaft excavation to the size and depth required .

Immediately remove drilling tools that are lost in the excavation .
F. Constructing Using Casings .
Construct drilled shafts using casings where shown on the Plans or where the dry or wet construction methods are inadequate to prevent caving or excessive deformation of the hole .
The Contractor may either place casings in a predrilled hole or advance casings through the ground by twisting driving or vibrating .
When installing casings that are left in rock for the purpose of shielding voids ensure that the predrilled hole is not more than inches bigger than the casing diameter .
When downsizing of permanent casing is required do not overlap more than feet of casing .
When constructing drilled shafts in open water extend the exterior casings from above the water elevation into the ground to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete .
Install the casing to ensure a positive seal at the bottom of the casing so that no seepage of water or other materials occurs into or from the shaft excavation .
When casings are not shown on the Plans but the Contractor believes that casings are necessary the Contractor shall submit in the installation plan details of the proposed casing method including casing lengths and diameters and the proposed procedures of casing installation to the RE for review .
If the Contractor does not determine the need for casings until after work on the shafts has begun the Contractor shall submit to the RE for review a revised installation plan proposing the casing installation method for review .
Ensure that casings are clean round straight and free of weld breaks and holes that would allow passage of water or plastic concrete .
With RE approval the Contractor may provide casings larger in diameter than shown on the Plans . .
Temporary Casings .
Casings are temporary unless shown as permanent casings on the Plans .
Telescoping predrilling with slurry and overreaming to beyond the outside diameter of the casing may be required to install casing .
Remove temporary casing before completing concrete placement in the drilled shaft .
Before withdrawing the casing ensure that the level of plastic concrete in the casing is at least feet above either the hydrostatic water level in the formation or the level of drilling fluid in the annular space behind the casing whichever is higher .
As the casing is withdrawn maintain an adequate level of concrete within the casing so that fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward and discharged at the ground surface without contaminating or displacing the shaft concrete .
If the Contractor removes a specified diameter or length of casing and substitutes a longer or larger diameter casing through caving soils the Contractor shall stabilize the excavation using a slurry or backfill before the new casing is installed .
If temporary casings become bound or fouled during shaft construction and can not be practically removed the Department will designate the drilled shaft defective .
Submit working drawings for approval proposing corrective measures .
Do not begin corrective measures until the Department approves the working drawings. . Removable Casing .
When the shaft extends above ground or through a body of water the Contractor may use suitable removable casing for the portion exposed above ground or through a body of water except when permanent casing is specified .
Strip removable casing from the shaft and ensure that the concrete is not damaged .
The Contractor may remove casings when the concrete has attained a strength of at least pounds per square inch as determined from concrete cylinders field cured according to AASHTO T provided that curing of the concrete is maintained as specified in F. Do no expose the shaft concrete to salt water or moving water for days . .

If the selected slurry construction method fails in the opinion of the RE to produce the desired final results cease this method and propose an alternate method to the RE for approval .
Ensure that a heavily contaminated slurry suspension which could impair the free flow of concrete has not accumulated in the bottom of the shaft .
Before placing concrete for shaft excavation take slurry samples using a sampling tool approved by the RE .
Take slurry samples from the bottom of the shaft and at intervals not exceeding feet up the slurry column in the shaft until consecutive samples produce acceptable values for density viscosity sand content and pH at each sampling depth .
When slurry samples are unacceptable take corrective actions .
Do not place concrete until the slurry is resampled and test results are approved .
If the slurry remains in the shaft for more than hours or if caking develops roughen or reream the shaft with appropriate new bottom cleaning and slurry testing before concreting .

Special procedures and tools may include chisels boulder breakers core barrels air tools hand excavation temporary casing and increasing the hole diameter .
Do not blast without obtaining written approval from the RE .
I .
Rock Socketing .
The RE will determine the top of rock sound enough for the Contractor to begin the socket based on the existing borings and observations during shaft drilling .
The RE will not consider weathered or highly fractured rock as the top of rock socket .
Prepare rock socket for concrete placement by roughening with drilling tools or by overreaming as directed by the RE .
Rotate roughening tools against the rock socket area to remove accumulated slurry cake to scale off loose rock fragments and to roughen the finished rock socket surface .
J. Excavation Cleaning and Verification .
Unless otherwise approved by the RE ensure that at least percent of the base of each shaft has less than inch of sediment at the time of concrete placement .
Ensure that the maximum depth of sediment or debris at any place on the base of the shaft does not exceed inches .
In the presence of the RE determine the cleanliness of the bottom of the shaft by the use of sounding probe data video camera tape with weight or other methods approved by the RE .

K. Constructing Reinforcement Steel Cages .
Immediately after the shaft excavation has been inspected and approved assemble and place the reinforcement steel cage consisting of longitudinal and transverse bars ties cage stiffeners spacers centralizers and other necessary appurtenances before placing concrete .
Remove internal stiffeners as the cage is placed in the drilled shaft hole before placing concrete .
Use concrete spacers or other approved noncorrosive spacing devices at sufficient intervals near the bottom and at intervals not exceeding feet up the shaft to ensure concentric spacing for the entire cage length .
If the size of the spacers is not shown on the Plans provide spacers that will create a minimum inch annular space .
Provide cylindrical concrete supports to ensure that the bottom of the cage is maintained at the specified distance above the base .
L. Concrete Placement Time Limitations .
Place concrete according to the limitations specified in C. Continuously place concrete from the bottom to the top elevation of the shaft .
Ensure that the concrete placement is completed within hours .
The RE may allow the concrete placement time to exceed hours if the Contractor demonstrates that the slump of the concrete will not be less than inches during the entire time of concrete placement .
M. Concrete Placement Methods .
The Contractor may request additional set of cylinders to be taken for determining strength for early form removal as specified in G. If additional cylinders are requested notify the RE at least hours before placing .

Do not use tremie tubes that have aluminum parts that will come in contact with concrete .
Ensure that the tremie tube is watertight .
Do not begin placing concrete underwater until the tremie is placed to the shaft base elevation .
The Contractor may use valves bottom plates or plugs to ensure concrete discharge begins within one tremie diameter of the base .
Remove plugs from the excavation or construct them using a material that will not cause a defect in the shaft if not removed .
Construct the discharge end of the tremie to allow the free radial flow of concrete during placement operations .
Ensure that the tremie tube discharge end is immersed at least feet in concrete at all times after starting the flow of concrete .
Maintain a continuous flow of the concrete at a positive pressure differential to prevent water or slurry intrusion into the shaft concrete .
If the tremie tube discharge end is removed from the plastic concrete and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level the RE will consider the drilled shaft defective .
To correct this defect the Contractor may remove the reinforcement cage and concrete complete necessary sidewall removal directed by the RE and replace the shaft or the Contractor may replug the tremie tube recharge with concrete and insert a minimum of feet below the existing top level of concrete before continuing placing concrete . .
Pumped Method .
Ensure that pump lines have a minimum diameter of inches and are constructed with watertight joints .
Ensure that the discharge end remains at least feet below the surface of the plastic concrete .
When lifting the pump line during concreting temporarily reduce the line pressure until the discharge end has been repositioned at a higher level in the excavation .
If at any time during the concrete pour the pump line discharge end is removed from the fluid concrete column and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level consider the shaft defective .
In such case remove the reinforcement cage and concrete complete any necessary sidewall removal directed by the RE and replace the shaft .
Ensure that waste concrete overflows the full top circumference of the casing evenly .
Waste concrete is the top inches of the initial concrete placed plus the height of additional volume of waste concrete deposited in the shaft where concrete placement was halted and restarted plus any additional amount necessary to produce full strength nonsegregated concrete at the plan shaft top level .
Continue placing concrete until the waste concrete is pushed upward and ejected completely out of the top of the casing and wasted or place an additional inches of concrete above the planned shaft top level and allow to cure in place for removal later .
Remove waste concrete at the top of the shaft to maintain a uniform appearance and to meet the specified dimensions of the shaft .
Do not channel or bleed off waste concrete using notches holes or cuts in the casing top .
The Contractor may remove or pump out plastic concrete in the casing that is above the top elevation of the drilled shaft after ejecting waste concrete to the top elevation .
N. Approval .
Compare the computed theoretical volume of the excavation with the actual volume of concrete placed and create a plot of depth versus volume .
Provide results to the RE .
After placing the concrete ensure that the top of the reinforcement steel cage is within inches and inches of the Plan elevation .
Ensure that the top elevation of the completed drilled shaft is within inches and inch of the Plan elevation .
The RE may reject drilled shafts because of damage failure to advance through mislocation misalignment or failure to install the drilled shaft to the proper bearing stratum or results of CSL testing indicating defects .
For each rejected drilled shaft submit to the RE for approval a plan showing how to correct the problem and prevent its reoccurrence .
Repair augment or replace the drilled shaft .
If the RE rejects a drilled shaft the Contractor shall cease the construction of all other drilled shafts until the Contractor demonstrates the ability to construct an approved drilled shaft .
Within days after completing the installation of all drilled shafts and before removing the drilled shaft installation equipment from the Project Limits provide the RE with a plan certified by a land surveyor registered in the State of New Jersey showing the asinstalled location of drilled shafts .
The RE will analyze the total loads on individual drilled shafts based on the survey data .
If the load on any drilled shaft exceeds percent of the specified load capacity correct the drilled shaft as directed by the RE .

The RE will determine conformance to the surface tolerance for concrete deck slabs in lots each lot being equal to the number of cubic yards of deck concrete placed in the designated lanes of traffic from joint assembly to joint assembly .
The RE will calculate such lot quantity using the specified nominal deck thickness excluding the quantity of concrete placed in haunches end dams and diaphragms .
The RE will base acceptance on the percentage of the total length of the lot having surface variation exceeding inch in feet this percent noncompliance being defined as the Lot Percent Defective Length .
To compute the lot percent defective length add the lengths of individual surface defects exceeding the specified tolerance and divide this sum by the total length tested then multiply by to convert to percent .
The RE will test the full extent of the lot in the longitudinal direction .
The transverse location of the test generally is in the wheelpaths of vehicle travel which are defined as the imaginary lines located approximately feet on each side of the centerline of the lane and extending for the full length of the lane .
If the lot percent defective length equals or exceeds on any machine finished deck irrespective of whether such machine finishing was required or optional or on a manually struck and finished deck the RE may order any or all of the concrete in the lot to be removed replaced and retested for acceptance .
If the RE allows the concrete to remain in place apply a percent reduction to the payment request for the lot .
