Analysis is based on an Acceptable Quality Level AQL of percent .
The AQL is the minimum Percent Within Limits PWL at which the material is considered fully acceptable and receives a . pay factor .
As an incentive to produce quality material a pay factor greater than .
is possible .
The maximum pay factor obtainable is ..
The procedure for estimating the PWL uses the number n the arithmetic mean and the sample standard deviation s of acceptance test results as shown below .
If the sample standard deviation is less than .
then it is set at .. a .
The arithmetic mean is computed Where test result for sublot i. sum of values from sublot to n. b .
The sample standard deviation is computed The upper specification limit USL and lower specification limit LSL are equal to the Target Value TV plus and minus the allowable tolerances as defined in the pay item specification .
Quality Indexes are computed as shown below .
The maximum Quality Index obtainable is .. c. The Upper Quality Index QU is computed d. The Lower Quality Index QL is computed SECTION ALASKA The computed QU and QL are used with AASHTO R to determine the Percent Within Upper Limits PWLU and Percent Within Lower Limits PWLL .
e. The PWL used in pay factor determination is When material requirements are onesided with only an upper or lower limit then the PWL is equal to the percent within the side that has a limit .
For example if a material only has an upper specification maximum limit then PWL PWLU .
Also twosided specification limits with one side that can not be exceeded like percent passing will be analyzed as if they are onesided .

to ..
When PWL is less than .
the pay factor PF zero .

Remove concrete laitance during or immediately after concrete placement operations have ended .
Do not allow water fluids drilling aids or concrete from the top of the shaft to enter streams or other waterways .
Construct the discharge end of the tremie or pump line to prevent water intrusion and permit the free flow of concrete during concrete placement .
Use caps bottom plates pigs or other such devices inserted into or attached to discharge pipe to separate the concrete from the excavation fluid during initial charging of the discharge pipe .
Ensure the discharge pipe has sufficient length and weight to rest on the shaft base before starting concrete placement .

Remove concrete laitance during or immediately after concrete placement operations have ended .
Concrete Plasticity Requirements .
Ensure concrete placed in the shaft remains plastic throughout placement operations by completing placement operations before initial set occurs . .
Concrete Decks and Approach Slabs .

Limit the rate of placing concrete to what can be finished before initial set .
a .
Placement Sequence .
Place the concrete deck in the sequence shown on the Plans .
The Engineer may approve a revised placement sequence for casting the concrete deck continuously from one end to the other provided the following Stockpile the materials necessary to complete the placement and have the equipment incidentals and workers on the site before beginning concrete placement operations .
Ensure the continuous concrete placement and finishing operation proceeds at a minimum rate of feet per hour measured longitudinally along the axis of the span .
The Engineer determines the revised placement sequence will not reduce the stability during construction and will not reduce the quality capacity or durability of the completed structure .
If the Engineer approves the proposal for a continuous concrete placement operation the Department will observe and evaluate performance to the first planned construction joint in the sequence .
At this point the Engineer may authorize you to proceed with the continuous concrete placement operation or suspend the placement and install a construction joint .
The Engineers decision will be based on whether the concrete can be produced delivered and finished at a continuous rate permitting the structure to accommodate final dead load deflections while the concrete is plastic .
If the Engineer suspends the continuous concrete placement operations after the first sequential placement submit modifications for improving the continuous concrete placement operations beginning at the other end of the deck .
If a second attempt at continuous concrete placement is authorized the placement will be evaluated and allowed or terminated based on the same criteria as the first sequential placement .
If the Engineer suspends the continuous concrete placement operation after the second attempt additional attempts will not be permitted .
Follow the deck placing sequence shown on the Plans .

Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer pump grout at a rate of feet to feet of duct per minute to avoid air entrapment segregation of the grout and to ensure complete filling of the duct .
Conduct normal grouting operations at a pressure range of psi to psi measured at the grout inlet .
Do not exceed the maximum pumping pressure of psi at the grout inlet .
Pump grout through the duct and continuously discharge grout from the first and subsequent outlets until residual water and entrapped air have been removed and the consistency of the grout is equivalent to that of the grout being pumped into the inlet .
Discharge at least gallon of grout from each outlet prior to closing the vent .
Close all outlet vents in a similar manner one after another in the direction of flow except that at intermediate crests close outlet vents placed a short distance downstream of the crest before closing their associated high point vent .

If this procedure is used equip the new inlet vent with a positive shutoff and pressure gage . .
Temperature Considerations .
Do not grout if the ambient air temperature exceeds F. Do not grout if the ambient air temperature is expected to be less than F within hours .
Ensure grout temperature upon mixing is between F and F. If the ambient air temperature is below F keep ducts free of water to avoid damage due to freezing .
Do not warm ducts with steam .
Blow dry air percent humidity or less through the ducts to extract trapped water .
Ensure ducts are free of frost and ice before commencing grouting operations. . PostGrouting Inspection .
Do not remove or open vents until the grout has cured for at least hours .
After the grout has cured remove outlets and grout caps located at anchorages and high points along the tendon to facilitate inspection .
If voids are suspected or if duct grouting operations were prematurely terminated prior to completely filling the duct explore the voided area inside the duct with an endoscope borescope videoscope or other visual means approved by the Engineer .
Probing is not allowed .
Determine the location and extent of all voided areas .
Depending on the location of the void drilling may be required to penetrate the inner surface of the anchorage or duct .
Use drilling equipment that will automatically shutoff when steel is encountered . .
Repairing and Filling Voids .
Repair and fill voids that occur in the ducts after the grouting operation is complete .
If voids are found submit a grouting repair plan for review and approval that describes the location and extent of the void and the method of repairing and filling the void .
If the extent and location of the void is such that complete filling of the void is not possible using the grout injection equipment repair and fill the void using a volumetric measuring vacuum grouting process utilizing the vacuum grouting equipment specified in Subsection .
Finishing .
Remove valves caps and pipes for each vent to a depth at least inch below the surface of the concrete .
Fill the void left by the vent pipe according to Subsection Do not remove or open vents until the grout as set for at least hours. . Protection of End Anchorages .
Within days upon completion of the grouting permanently protect the anchorage of posttensioning tendons to prevent access of water or other aggressive agents .
Immediately before casting the concrete pourbacks within hours mechanically clean and roughen the mating concrete surfaces to remove any laitance and to expose small aggregate .
Use abrasive blast cleaning or water blasting with a pressure washer capable of at least psi nozzle pressure at all elevations to clean the concrete surfaces .
Keep the nozzle tip no more than inches from the surface during all phases of water blasting .
Flush the surface with water and blow dry .
Ensure surfaces are clean sound and without standing water .
Unless otherwise specified in the Contract documents or shown on the approved shop drawings ensure the prestressing steel and all parts of the anchoring assemblies are at least inches inside of the end surface of the member .
Apply an epoxy bonding agent to the concrete mating surfaces according the manufacturers instructions .
