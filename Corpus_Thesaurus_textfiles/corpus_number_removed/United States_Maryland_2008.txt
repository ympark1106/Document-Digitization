.. Steel Strand Tensioning .
In all methods of tensioning measure the stress induced in the strands both by jacking gauges and by elongation .
PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS AND SLAB PANELS If any jack or gauge appears to be giving erratic results or gauge pressures and elongations indicate materially different stresses during manufacturing recalibration will be required .
Provide means for measuring elongation to the nearest in .
For differences in indicated stress between jack pressure and elongation of up to percent place the difference so that the discrepancy will be on the side of a slight overstress rather than understress .
For discrepancies in excess of percent carefully check the entire operation and determine the source of the discrepancy before proceeding .

Cut all pretensioned steel strands flush with the end of the member .
Where the end of the member will not be covered by concrete clean the exposed ends of the strands and the concrete face .
