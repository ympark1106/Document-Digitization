Active Voice Imperative Mood .
These Standard Specifications are written with an emphasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice someone acts on something .
For example The Contractor will place the concrete .
A similar sentence in the passive voice The concrete will be placed would be unclear about who was responsible for placing the concrete .
The Standard Specifications also are written in the imperative mood .
The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
The Department is stating its requirements or directions for the work to the Contractor such statements have the same force as if they contained the words the Contractor will .
In an imperative sentence such as Place the concrete the Department is indicating that it requires the Contractor to place the concrete .
Before contract award imperative statements are directed to the bidders .
After contract award imperatives are directed to the Contractor .
The Department will identify parties other than the bidder or the Contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in these Standard Specifications .
In phrasings where the responsible party is clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so the Department may use the passive voice .
All approvals and consents are granted and all direction is given by the Engineer .
All submittals are sent to the Engineer. . Organization of Specifications .

In all full credit would be allowed for the participation of trucks .
In respect to the other trucks provided by Firm Z DBE credit could be awarded only for the fees or commissions pertaining to those trucks Firm X receives because of the lease with Firm Z .
A lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use and control over the leased truck .
This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease if the DBE consents so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck .
A leased truck must conspicuously display the name and identification number of the DBE .
d. percent of the fees for equipment leased from a DBE towards the contract goal when the Contractor leases the equipment from a DBE provided the DBE owns or has the equipment registered in its name .

b .
Production Blasting .
Production blasting is rock fragmentation blasts resulting from more widely spaced production holes drilled throughout the main excavation area adjacent to the controlled blast line or from the production holes in a rock quarry .
Take necessary precautions in the production blasting to minimize blast damage to the final cut slope .
c. Controlled Blasting .
Controlled blasting refers to the controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories in carefully spaced and aligned drill holes to produce a smooth surface or shear plane in the rock along the specified final excavation backslope .
Controlled blasting techniques allowed are presplitting and cushion blasting .
Other controlled blasting techniques may be used if approved .
Use controlled blasting in the excavation of rock or hard cemented materials where cut slopes are equal to or steeper than ¾HV even if the rock or hard materials can be ripped except at the Engineers discretion based on the Contractors demonstration the finished slope meets the slope design .
Controlled blasting is typically not required for rock quarry operations .
Remove potentially dangerous boulders or other material located beyond the excavation limits before drilling controlled blastholes .
Removal of material located beyond the excavation limits is extra work .
Presplitting .
Presplitting is the detonation of a single line of lightlyloaded closelyspaced drill holes before the detonation of adjacent production holes .
Perform presplitting in accordance with the following requirements a Control drilling operations by using proper equipment and techniques to ensure that no hole deviates from the plane of the planned slope by more than inches in ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction of either parallel to or normal direction to the final excavation slope .
The Engineer will allow offset benches up to feet wide for multilift blasts .
If shown on the plans specified or directed the offset benches will be removed during excavation of the next lift to a slope of at least below horizontal .
The Department will not pay for presplit holes exceeding these tolerances .
b Extend presplit holes at least feet beyond the production hole limits or to the end of the cut as applicable .
c Limit presplit blastholes to feet in length for each lift of blasting .
Do not exceed the specified lift height after a test blast is performed .
d Begin the controlled blasthole drilling at a point that will allow for necessary offsets and adjust at the start of lower lifts to account for drift that may have occurred in the upper lifts .
The Department will ensure the offsets are within the project site .
e Determine if the hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth before placing charges .
If drillhole conditions vary from dry to wet use appropriate explosives types andor blasting accessories to accomplish the specified results .
f Do not use bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil ANFO as explosive for controlled blasting .
g Use only standard explosives specifically manufactured for presplitting in presplit holes .
h As long as satisfactory presplit slopes are obtained the Contractor may either detonate the presplit blasting holes forming the slope face before drilling for production blasting or detonate the presplit blasting holes forming the slope face and the production blastholes within the same blast event provided the presplitting drill holes are detonated at least milliseconds ahead of the adjacent production blastholes .
Cushion Blasting .
Cushion or trim blasting is similar to presplitting except the detonation along the cut face is performed after the detonation of the production holes .
Where the horizontal distance from the cut face to the existing rock face is less than feet the Contractor may cushion blast instead of presplitting .
With the exception of these criteria the requirements specified for presplitting also apply to cushion blasting . .
Method of Measurement .
The Engineer will measure acceptably completed work as follows .
Excavation borrow and granular borrow will be by the cubic yard in its original position from field survey or photogrammetric crosssections using the averageendarea method with no correction for curvature or by the ton. . Where it is impractical to measure material by the averageendarea method or in its original position alternate practical methods with appropriate adjustments may be used .
The total will not include the volume of material used for purposes other than as directed .
A measurement will not be made for rock excavation made below the roadbed unless the excavation is required or directed .
A measurement will not be made for borrow replaced by unauthorized rock or soil excavation below roadbed. . Channel change excavation will be measured only for excavation necessary to construct the channel or ditch from established bank elevation to flowline grade .
Earthwork necessary to construct the cut or fill to bank elevation will be included in the roadway quantities .
Overbreak will not be included in the measurement of excavation .
of ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction .
Water ordered for dust abatement will be measured by the thousands of gallons MG where MG equals gallons by means of calibrated tanks distributors or accurate water meters . .
Controlled blasting will be measured by the foot of drilled hole as shown on the blasting or driller logs .
The Department will measure only those holes drilled and detonated for creating a final excavation face as controlled blasting . .
When granular borrow is measured on the weight basis the water in excess of percent of the dry weight of the material will not be measured .
