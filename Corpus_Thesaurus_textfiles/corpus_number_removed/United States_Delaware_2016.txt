Submit the qualifications of the selected pile testing firm for dynamic testing for approval at the time of the wave equation analysis submittal .
Approval will be based on qualifications and applicable previous experience on other projects .
C. Wave Equation Analysis Requirements .
Use the wave equation analysis to verify the adequacy of the pile driving system and to establish the necessary blow counts stroke heights pile cushions and any other applicable information for use in driving initial test piles to the required bearing resistance and tip elevation .
These criteria may be reevaluated during test pile driving and may or may not be revised for production pile driving .
Include computer input and output sheets and suitable data plots displaying the wave equation analysis for the pile driving throughout the various subsurface conditions of the site .
Show resistance versus blow count as well as maximum tension and compression stresses versus resistance on the plots .
Perform a wave equation analysis for each test and indicator pile unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents .
Evaluate drivability of the pile to various depths of penetration using the proposed driving system .
Evaluate the driving conditions for percent penetration percent penetration percent penetration percent penetration and percent penetration of the pile during initial driving and after setup condition as a minimum .
Perform additional analysis at depths where difficult driving or significant changes in drivability are anticipated .
One hundred percent penetration refers to penetration to the plan estimated tip elevation to achieve the designated ultimate resistance .
Use the wave equation analysis estimate of tip elevation for the ultimate resistance if it differs from the Plan estimate by more than percent at percent penetration .
Show the driving conditions for Plan estimated depth in the analysis if the wave equation analysis estimate is chosen as percent penetration .
Use the estimated friction and end bearing values obtained by the static soil analysis along with soil layer specific quake and damping values and friction parameters for each level of penetration in the drivability analysis .
As a minimum include ultimate resistances blow counts compressive and tensile stresses and transferred energy plotted as a function of depth of penetration in the analysis output .
Submit the static soil analysis with the wave equation analysis .
If the driving Equipment consists of a varying energy or varying stroke type hammer such as an open ended diesel hammer perform an additional analysis that plots blow count versus stroke andor energy for a fixed resistance equal to the ultimate resistance bearing graph .
Select a hammer that drives the pile to its required penetration to achieve required bearing or minimum tip elevation with a driving resistance not exceeding blows per inches .
Driving resistance can not exceed blows per inch in the last inches of penetration .

a .
For steel piles the maximum permissible compressive or tensile driving stress is percent of the minimum yield strength of the pile material .
b .
For prestressed concrete piles in normal environments the maximum permissible tensile stress is multiplied by the square root of the concrete compressive strength f c plus the effective prestress value fpe or fc fpe with all units expressed in pounds per square inch .
DRIVEN PILES SECTION c. The maximum permissible compressive stress for prestressed concrete piles is percent of the compressive strength minus the effective prestress value or .

Ensure the pile cushion dimensions match the crosssectional area of the pile top .
The Engineer will evaluate the use of manufactured pile cushion materials in lieu of a wood pile cushion on a casebycase basis . .
Leads .
Use leads to support piles in line and position while being driven .
Construct pile driver leads to allow the hammer to move freely while maintaining the alignment with the pile to ensure concentric impact for each blow .
The Contractor may either use fixed or swingingtype leads .
When using swingingtype leads fit a pile gate at the bottom of the leads and in the case of battered piles fit a horizontal brace between the crane and the leads as necessary .
Ensure that the pile section being driven does not extend above the leads .
Adequately embed the leads in the ground or constrain the pile DRIVEN PILES SECTION in a structural frame such as a template to maintain alignment .
Provide leads of sufficient length to make the use of a follower unnecessary and designed to allow proper alignment of battered piles . .
Followers .
Only use followers when approved in writing by the Engineer or when specifically stated in the Contract Documents .
In cases where a follower is allowed drive the first pile in each bent and every tenth pile driven thereafter fulllength without a follower to determine that adequate pile penetration is being attained to develop the ultimate pile resistance .
Hold and maintain the follower and pile in equal and proper alignment during driving .
Use a follower of the material and dimensions that will allow the piles to be driven to the penetration depth determined necessary from the driving of the fulllength piles .
Verify the final position and alignment of the first two piles installed with followers in each substructure unit according to the location tolerances specified in Section B. before installing additional piles . .
Jets .
Only perform jetting if approved in writing by the Engineer or when specifically stated in the Contract Documents .
Water jets will not be permitted when installing any steel H piles .
When jetting is not required in the Contract Documents but approved after the Contractors request determine the number of jets and the volume and pressure of water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the final inplace pile .
Assume responsibility for damage to the site caused by unapproved or improper jetting operations .
When jetting is specifically required in the Contract Documents provide a jetting plant having sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure equivalent to at least pounds per square inch at two inch jet nozzles .
In either case unless otherwise directed by the Engineer remove jet pipes when the pile toe is a minimum of feet above the prescribed toe elevation and drive the pile to the required ultimate pile resistance with a pile hammer .
Also control perform any necessary treatment and dispose of jet water in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer .
E. Augering .
When stated in the Contract Documents auger holes at pile locations to the depths shown on the Plans .
Auger holes of a size smaller than the diameter or diagonal of the pile cross section that is sufficient to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth .
If subsurface obstructions such as boulders or rock layers are encountered the Contractor may increase the hole diameter to the least dimension adequate for pile installation .
Maintain augered holes open using bentonite slurry casing or an equivalent method both before and during pile driving operations .
Fill the void space remaining around the pile after completion of driving with sand or other approved Material .
Do not use spuds a short strong driven member that is removed to make a hole for inserting a pile in lieu of augering .

Engage a consultant responsible for conducting air monitoring Work during the period of the paint removal operations .
Submit the qualifications of the consultant for approval by the Department prior to hisher engagement in any air monitoring service .
Conduct monitoring on the area downwind of the lead control area .
Monitor the air quality standard in accordance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS .
At a minimum the containment system must achieve a SSPC Guide Level Standard Emissions level. . Record baseline monitoring at each structure where the Contractor is required to clean the existing steel in order to establish preconstruction background readings for the areas involved .
Perform baseline monitoring for a minimum of consecutive Calendar Days before the steel cleaning begins .
Conduct the monitoring so that the monitored hours match the proposed Work Schedule for the Contract including night work .
The minimum duration of the monitoring for each Calendar Day must be hours regardless of the Contractors proposed Work Schedule .
The required sampling type shall be two PM and two TSPLead and the Engineer must approve the locations of the sampling .
During lead paint removal commence air monitoring just prior to the start of any lead removal operation and continue whenever the steel cleaning operation is in progress .
Paint removal includes blasting as well as cleanup activities .
If problems with containment occur the Engineer will require the air monitoring to be reinstalled at no cost to the Department . .
The acceptance level for Particulate Matter PM particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal micrometers shall be micrograms per cubic meter of air for hour average concentration micrograms per cubic meter of air over an eighthour period assuming no emissions occur from the project for the remaining hours . .
The acceptance level for Total Suspended Particulate Matter TSP lead emissions shall be .
micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over a calendar quarter of the year which can be converted as noted below to achieve daily lead level allowance during the project operation DA PD x . micrograms per cubic meter .
where DA Daily Allowance micrograms per cubic meter PD Number of paint removal operation days anticipated in a day period .
STEEL COATINGS SECTION For example if it is expected that days out of will be worked the TSP lead emission criteria for each of those days would be .
micrograms per cubic meter over a hour period x ..
However since the paint removal operation will not continue for the full hours this level of emissions can be increased using the following formula ADA DA x H where ADA Adjusted Daily Allowance micrograms per cubic meter H Hours worked in hours .
Using the above example if the paint removal operation is continued for eight hours out of each hour workday the ADA will be .
micrograms per cubic meter .
micrograms per cubic meter x .
Thus .
μgm could be emitted during the eight hours of Work provided no emissions occur during the remaining hours. . Use a containment system that is an area approximately equivalent to what a work crew can blast clean inspect paint and move in a hour period .
The Engineer may permit a larger containment system if the Contractor can demonstrate that such a system will increase productivity and not interfere with the flow of traffic .
When dust leaks are noted in the containment system make repairs as soon as possible . .
If the containment system fails to function at the required level of efficiency at any time during the execution of the Work as determined by the Engineer immediately suspend all operations except those intended to minimize the adverse impact to the environment .
