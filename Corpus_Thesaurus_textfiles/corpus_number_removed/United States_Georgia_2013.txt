Observing Weather Limitations Begin pressure grouting operations when the air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is at least ºF ºC and rising .
Stop pressure grouting if the temperature is ºF ºCand falling or when the subgrade contains an abnormal amount of moisture .
B .
Testing Slab testing is performed to detect all slabs having a deflection greater than .
in .
mm .
Perform testing between AM and AM unless otherwise directed by the Engineer .
In hot weather test between AM and AM if directed by the Engineer .
Stop testing if slabs are beginning to lockup . .
Preliminary Testing by the Department Preliminary testing is not required on slabs that require grouting but have been previously tested and marked by the Department . .
Preliminary Testing by the Contractor If the Department has not performed preliminary testing use static methods to test each transverse joint and crack on the Project or within designated Project areas .
Do not test however transverse cracks in slabs that are to be replaced entirely .
Test the joints and cracks as follows a. Furnish four gauges on two gauge mounts two gauges per mount that can detect slab movement under the load to the nearest .
in .
mm .
b .
Maintain the gauges and mounts in operating order .
Furnish the loaded truck truck operator and personnel to place and assist in operating the gauges .
c. Position one set of gauges with one gauge referenced to the corner of each slab on both sides of the joint near the pavement edge .
Zero in the gauges with no load on the slab on either side of the joint .
d. Move the test truck into position and stop it with the center of the test axle about ft mm behind the joint and the outside test wheel approximately ft mm from the pavement edge .
e. Read the back gauge and move the test truck across the joint to about ft mm forward of the joint .
Read the forward gauge .
f. Repeat this operation for each joint to be tested .
The Inspector will read and record the gauges .
g. When required perform additional tests on slabs that move more than .
in .
mm or as shown on the Plans .
Perform additional tests as follows Drill one hole in the corner of the slab where the movement was measured .
Drill the holes the same diameter as the undersealing holes and place the holes in mm from the transverse and shoulder joint .
Fill the test holes with water and observe .
If the Engineer believes the pavement system readily drains the water poured into the test hole pressure grout the slab .
Based on the results of testing deflection measurements and water drainage observations the Engineer will determine which slabs require undersealing .
h. After the designated slabs have been pressure grouted according to these Specifications retest them according to Subsection B .
Testing .
i. Regrout and retest slabs that deflect more than .
in .
mm or deflect the amount shown on the Plans as directed .
Section Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Conrete Pavement Slabs will be accepted that continue to show movement greater than specified after two properly performed groutings .
C. Drilling Holes The Plans show the location of holes to be drilled in each type of slab for undersealing .
However whenever possible use the holes from previous undersealing work by redrilling .
To begin drilling .
Use the hole pattern and pumping sequence shown on the Plans with modifications to use as many holes from previous undersealing work as possible .
The Engineer may alter the hole pattern .
Only the actual number of holes drilled will be considered for payment for the initial undersealing . .
Drill the holes .
in mm diameter or another size if approved by the Engineer .
Ensure that the holes provide positive seal for the pumping nozzle. . For the first undersealing drill the holes to approximately in mm deep beneath the bottom of the concrete unless the Engineer approves an alternate depth .

E. Pumping Underseal Grout Properly position the lift measuring device before pumping grout under a slab .
Fill the voids under a slab as follows .
Pump grout in holes designated by the Engineer. . Have the Engineer determine the time of day to perform pressure grouting .
The Engineer may require pressure grouting during late night and early morning hours if the slabs can not be stabilized with daytime grouting. . During pumping watch the lift measuring device to prevent excessive pumping pressures rapid lifting of slabs or substantial rising of the adjacent shoulders. . Stop pumping in the hole when the cavities or voids are filled within the range of the hole being grouted .
Grout flowing out of an adjacent hole or joint or the edge of the slab is sufficient evidence that the voids and cavities are filled and pumping should cease .
Additional evidence is that the slab rises rapidly or the adjacent shoulder begins to rise .
a .
Lift the slab slightly to move grout into the existing cavities and voids .
b .
Do not lift more than .
in .
mm for a slab measured at the outside joint corner unless approved by the Engineer .
NOTE Do not crack the slabs by differential lifting . .
Secure the discharge hose nozzle in the hole to provide a seal that will maintain the grout pressure underneath the slab .
Ensure that the nozzle end does not extend below the bottom of the concrete. . Continue pumping in a hole until a clear flow of grout comes out other holes joints or cracks or until the slab begins to lift excessively .
Section Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Conrete Pavement .
Repeat this procedure in other holes until the voids are filled .
Do not plug the holes during grouting operations . .
When edge drains are near the shoulder or pavement interface take precautions to minimize the amount of grout that flows into the edge drain system .
Use the following procedure or an alternate approved by the Engineer to monitor grout flow into the edge drain system a .
Drill one or more observation holes in the asphaltic concrete shoulder as close as possible to the shoulder or pavement interface .
b .

.. Construction A .
Contractor Options The Contractor may choose from these options when constructing the structure according to the Department plans .
Alternative Prestressing Systems The Contractor may use posttensioning systems other than those shown on the Plans .
The alternative system may use wires bars or strands anchored with friction grips or bearings .
Unless the Plans allow do not use prestressing systems that incorporate deadend anchorages .
Choose alternative systems that can be stressed from either end unless the construction staging does not allow room to stress tendons from both ends .
In this case use anchorage systems with compression plates or fittings to seat anchor wedges . .
Alternative Stressing or Anchorage Blocks Stressing or anchorage blocks for the structure may deviate from those shown on the Plans .
Alternate stressing or anchorage blocks must be located inside the box .
Place the blocks in any of the following locations At the juncture of the bottom of the top slab At the juncture of the top of the bottom slab and the web walls Within fillet areas in reinforced stressing blocks In partial depth diaphragms Section Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning Permanent or temporary stressing blockouts are allowed in the top of the top slab when posttensioning ducts do not have a moistureretaining low point .

Install the Ducts Install ducts for prestressing steel as follows .
Support ducts at intervals of no more than ft mm .
The horizontal tolerance for longitudinal ducts in the top or bottom slab is plus or minus in mm .
The vertical tolerance for longitudinal ducts is plus or minus in mm. . Join rigid duct sections using positive metallic connections .
Connect the sections carefully to prevent misaligning the ducts at the joints. . Use waterproof tape at the connections. . Make duct splices so that the nose of the tendon being pushed into the duct goes from a male end into a female end .
This prevents tendons from catching on a duct end. . Stagger splices in ducts to prevent splices in the same location in a row of ducts .
Stagger the splices to give a ft mm longitudinal spacing from row to row . .
Carefully cut and deburr the ends of ducts. . Use ducts or anchorage assemblies with pipes or other connections as grout ports for injecting grout after the prestressing .
Ports are required at each tendon anchorage. . Place continuousdraped longitudinal ducts in the web in one vertical row at the center of the web . .
Tie the ducts securely to the saddles which shall hold the duct in position during concrete placement and hardening . .
Ensure that the clear distance between the ducts is times the maximum size aggregate in the concrete mix or in mm whichever is greater. . Do not bundle ducts. . See Figure below for an illustration of how to tie duct support saddles . .
If needed place ducts in the top or bottom slab in one of these ways Horizontally at the variable spacings In closely and uniformly spaced groups The minimum horizontal clear spacing between ducts must be in mm . .
Install at least one more continuity duct than needed in each web throughout the length of the structure .
This duct will be used during blockage and excessive prestress losses during construction . .
Position the ends of the additional ducts to use anchorage blocks if necessary. . Vent continuity ducts over each intermediate support .
Provide vents with a diameter of at least in mm and made of either steel or polyethylene . .
Provide vents at the low point of every duct to drain off water in the duct. . Connect vents to ducts using approved metallic structural fasteners . .
Ensure that the vents are Mortar tight Taped as necessary Sealable Capable of allowing grout to be injected through them .
Immediately before installing the prestressing steel demonstrate to the Engineer that ducts are unobstructed and free of water and debris .
Section Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning .
After installing ducts in the forms keep the duct ends sealed to keep out water and debris. . After posttensioning the steel fill ducts with or without strands full of grout. . After the grout has set remove the ends of the vents flush with the concrete surface .

Jacking of both ends does not need to be done simultaneously . .
When approved by the Engineer and if shown on the Plans tension bent cap tendons by jacking from one end only . .
Tension the prestressing tendons in simple span posttensioned members by jacking from one end only . .
When tensioning from one end of the tendon only tension half of the prestressing steel in each member from one end and the other half from the opposite end of the span unless otherwise shown on the Plans . .
Unless allowed on the Plans do not use prestressing systems that incorporate deadend anchorages. . Where construction staging does not allow room to stress tendons from both sides use anchorage systems with compression plates or fittings to seat anchor wedges . .
Ensure that the prestressing steel force does not drop below the value shown on the Plans . .
Ensure that the tendon force measured by gauge pressure is within percent of the force calculated by elongation movement . .
If the measured elongation at the jacking stress varies more than percent from the theoretical elongation or if the unbalanced force about the section center line exceeds percent a .
Check the entire operation and determine the error .
b .
Correct the error to the Engineers satisfaction before proceeding with the work. . Do not allow the total force at each section to drop below the total prestressing force specified .
However the prestressing force may vary plus or minus percent per tendon . .
Unless otherwise specified on the Plans ensure that the average working stress in the prestressing steel does not exceed percent of the yield point stress of the prestressing steel. . To determine the amount of steel required ensure that the maximum temporary tensile jacking stress in prestressing steel does not exceed percent of its specified minimum ultimate tensile strength unless the Plans indicate a lower jacking stress. . Anchor the prestressing steel at stresses initial stress that will retain working forces at or higher than the minimum values shown on the Plans or approved by the Engineer .
Do not allow the initial stress to exceed percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel . .
Check that the loss of elongation from anchor set agrees with the anticipated value used in the stress calculations .
a .
Adjust measured Elongation to account for the actual measured anchor set .
b .
Maintain percent agreement between the elongation and the stressing force .
Section Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning .
To compute the prestress losses from friction use the formula in the AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridge Article The total friction losses at any section will be the sum of the effects for each tendon depending on its anchorage location for each tendon. . To compute other prestress losses use the AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridge Article .
After stressing and anchoring tendons and after the Engineer approves trim projecting tendons by sawing as shown in the approved working drawings .
