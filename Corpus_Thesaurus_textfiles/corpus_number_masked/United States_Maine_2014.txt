in computing that amount only the cost of the product and coating application cost will be included .

materials produced after july num num by convict labor may only be incorporated in a federalaid highway construction project if num such materials have been produced by convicts who are on parole supervised release or probation from a prison or anum num such material has been produced in a qualified prison facility e.g .
prison industry with the amount produced during any nummonth period for use in federalaid projects not exceeding the amount produced for such use during the nummonth period ending july num num .
materials obtained from prison facilities e.g .
prison industries are subject to the same requirements for federalaid participation that are imposed upon materials acquired from other sources .
materials manufactured or produced by convict labor will be given no preferential treatment .
the preferred method of obtaining materials for a project is through normal contracting procedures which require the contractor to furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work .
the contractor selects the source public or private from which the materials are to be obtained num cfr num .
prison industries are prohibited from bidding on projects directly num cfr nume but may act as material supplier to construction contractors .
prison materials may also be approved as statefurnished material .
however since public agencies may not bid in competition with private firms direct acquisition of materials from a prison industry for use as statefurnished material is subject to a public interest finding with the division administrators concurrence num cfr numd .
selection of materials produced by convict labor as statefurnished materials for mandatory use should be cleared prior to the submittal of the plans specifications estimates pse .
b. patentedproprietary products references num u.s.c .
num num cfr num fhwa will not participate directly or indirectly in payment for any premium or royalty on any patented or proprietary material specification or process specifically set forth in the plans and specifications for a project unless the item is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable unpatented items the sta certifies either that the proprietary or patented item is essential for synchronization with the existing highway facilities or that no equally suitable alternative exists or the item is used for research or for a special type of construction on relatively short sections of road for experimental purposes .
states should follow fhwas procedures for construction projects incorporating experimental features expermnt.htm for the submittal of work plans and evaluations .
the primary purpose of the policy is to have competition in selection of materials and allow for development of new materials and products .
the policy further permits materials and products that are judged equal may be bid under generic specifications .
if only patented or proprietary products are acceptable they shall be bid as alternatives with all or at least a reasonable number of acceptable materials or products listed and the division administrator may approve a single source if it can be found that its utilization is in the public interest .
anum trade names are generally the key to identifying patented or proprietary materials .
trade name examples include numm corten etc .
generally products identified by their brand or trade name are not to be specified without an or equal phrase and if trade names are used all or at least a reasonable number of acceptable equal materials or products should be listed .
the licensing of several suppliers to produce a product does not change the fact that it is a single product and should not be specified to the exclusion of other equally suitable products .
c. state preference references num u.s.c .
num num cfr num materials produced within maine shall not be favored to the exclusion of comparable materials produced outside of maine .
state preference clauses give particular advantage to the designated source and thus restrict competition .
therefore state preference provisions shall not be used on any federalaid construction projects .
this policy also applies to state preference actions against materials of foreign origin except as otherwise permitted by federal law .
thus states can not give preference to instate material sources over foreign material sources .
under the buy america provisions the states are permitted to expand the buy america restrictions provided that the sta is legally authorized under state law to impose more stringent requirements .
d. state ownedfurnisheddesignated materials references num u.s.c .
num num cfr num current fhwa policy requires that the contractor must furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work and the contractor shall be permitted to select the sources from which the materials are to be obtained .
exceptions to this requirement may be made when there is a definite finding by mainedot and concurred in by federal highway administrations fhwa division administrator that it is in the public interest to require the contractor to use materials furnished by the mainedot or from sources designated by mainedot .
the exception policy can best be understood by separating statefurnished materials into the categories of manufactured materials and local natural materials .
manufactured materials when the use of statefurnished manufactured materials is approved based on a public interest finding such use must be made mandatory .
the optional use of statefurnished manufactured materials is in violation of our policy prohibiting public agencies from competing with private firms .
manufactured materials to be furnished by mainedot must be acquired through competitive bidding unless there is a public interest finding for another method and concurred in by fhwas division administrator .
local natural materials when mainedot owns or controls a local natural materials source such as a borrow pit or a stockpile of salvaged pavement material etc .
the materials may be designated for either optional or mandatory use however mandatory use will require a public interest finding pif and fhwas division administrators concurrence .
anum in order to permit prospective bidders to properly prepare their bids the location cost and any conditions to be met for obtaining materials that are made available to the contractor shall be stated in the bidding documents .
mandatory disposal sites normally the disposal site for surplus excavated materials is to be of the contractors choosing although an optional sites may be shown in the contract provisions .
a mandatory site shall be specified when there is a finding by mainedot with the concurrence of the division administrator that such placement is the most economical or that the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost .
discussion of the mandatory use of a disposal site in the environmental document may serve as the basis for the public interest finding .
summarizing fhwa policy for the mandatory use of borrow or disposal sites mandatory use of either requires a public interest finding and fhwas division administrators concurrence mandatory use of either may be based on environmental consideration where the environment will be substantially enhanced without excessive additional cost and where the use is based on environmental considerations the discussion in the environmental document may be used as the basis for the public interest finding .
factors to justify a public interest finding should include such items as cost effectiveness system integrity and local shortages of material .
