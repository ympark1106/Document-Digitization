num determination of contract time extension for excusable nonexcusable noncompensable and compensable delays .
a .
general .
the number of days allowed for completion of the work or the completion date will be stated in the proposal and contract .
it is an essential part of the contract that the contractor performs fully entirely and in an acceptable manner the work under the contract within the contract time .
it is likewise essential that those parts phases or stages as stipulated in the contract for the purpose of benefiting the traveling public or for the coordination of work performed by others shall be completed by the date section num num nhdot go to toc division num division num division num division num standard division num division num division num specifications indicated .
an extension of the contract time may be granted by the department for conditions that prevent the contractor from effective prosecution of the critical activity which at that time control the progress of the work as specified in num.b or num.c .
strict adherence to the provisions of this section is necessary for the engineers consideration of an extension to the contract time .
the engineer will not evaluate a request for extension of the contract time unless the contractor notifies the engineer as specified in num.g provides the required analysis as specified in num.a.num and further provides the documentation to the contract administrator as specified in num.g and h. it is the intention of the department to act to mitigate or grant time extensions for delays before the delay is actually experienced by the project .
for this reason the contractor shall provide proper notice of a delay per num.g when it is first recognized not at its conclusion .
the contractors contention that it did not know the actual duration of the delay is not a valid excuse for failing to comply with the notice requirements of num.g .
however if the contractor requests in writing and the engineer agrees the engineer may extend the deadlines set forth in num.g .
the engineer will evaluate the contractors analysis and determine the time extension due if any .
the contractors plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for an extension of time .
when the contract sets forth a calendar completion date due consideration will have been given to the saturdays sundays legal holidays and the period between december num and april num inclusive in the anticipated period of construction .
no extension of the contract completion date will be allowed due to such days .
when the contract stipulates a completion date that falls on a saturday sunday or legal holiday or when the time as extended by the engineer falls on a date that is a saturday sunday or legal holiday the contract time will be extended to the next working day .
the extended completion date shall have the same standing and effect as though it was the original completion date .
if the contractor contends that an excusable delay is also compensable as specified in num.c the contractor shall submit a detailed cost analysis of the requested additional compensation prepared in accordance with num along with the request for the extension of the completion date .
in the event that the engineer extends the contract time into a period of the year during which the working conditions are less favorable consideration will be given to further extension of time as influenced by the nature of the work involved .
if the contract time or phase of work as established in the contract is based on working days the engineer will furnish a weekly statement showing the number of working days charged for the preceding week and the number of working days remaining for completion of the contract .
the contractor will be allowed num working days after the engineer issues the weekly statement to file a written protest setting forth the reasons the engineers weekly statement is incorrect otherwise the statement will be considered accepted by the contractor .
once accepted by the contractor whether explicitly or as a result of the contractors failure to file a timely protest the weekly statement is final and the contractor waives entitlement to a time extension or compensation for any delays not explicitly identified by the weekly statement .
an increase of quantities will increase the number of allowable working days by the ratio of the final contract total to the original contract amount total .
b. excusable noncompensable delay .
excusable noncompensable delays are delays that are not the contractors or the departments fault or responsibility .

the engineer will not consider weekends and holidays as lost work days unless the engineer directs the contractor to work those days .
num .
extraordinary delays in material deliveries the contractor or its suppliers can not foresee or avoid resulting from freight embargoes government acts or nationwide material shortages .
when an extension of the contract time is requested due to delays in the delivery of critical materials sufficient documentary evidence must be furnished to the department at the time the delay occurs showing that such delay results from the materials being unavailable by reason of an unusual market condition such as an industrywide strike natural disaster or areawide shortage which arises after bids are taken and which prevents the timely procurement of materials .
the contractor is not due a time extension for delays due to slow delivery from a source of supply when the required material is available elsewhere .
delays due to the contractors subcontractors or suppliers insolvency or mismanagement are not excusable .
num .
delays due to the failure of the department to provide rightofway in accordance with the contract .
num .
delays due to civil disturbances or acts of the public enemy .

delays due to epidemics or quarantine restrictions .
num .
delays from labor strikes that are beyond the control of the contractors subcontractors or suppliers and are not caused by improper acts or omissions of the contractor subcontractor or supplier .
num .
delays due to added quantities of work or extra work .
the department will base the time extension on the ratio of the original bid amount to the final contract amount computed as follows section num num nhdot go to toc division num division num division num division num standard division num division num division num specifications te tc ca ot ca te is the time extension in working days rounded to the next highest whole day ot is the original contract time in working days .
this time does not include time added by contract revisions or saturdays sundays legal holidays and the period between december num and april num tc is the total cost of the work performed including cost increases resulting from extra work for which a time extension was not previously provided and the net increase or decrease in the contract amount resulting from the performance of greater or lesser quantities for which an extension was not previously provided and excluding costs associated with liquidated damages incentivedisincentive or bonus payments and costs for contract revisions for which additional time has already been allowed ca is the original contract amount .
to determine a revised completion date the department will add the working days indicated by the formula to the original contract completion date .
if the contractor believes that this formula does not result in a fair and reasonable time extension for extra work or for increased quantities as an alternative but not in addition to the formula the contractor may submit an alternative analysis based on the delay to the critical path of the progress schedule accepted for documentation caused by the extra work or additional quantities .
the contractors analysis must consider not only the work added but also the work deleted in its analysis .
num .
delays due to utility or railroad relocations or any other railroad coordination delays .
num .
delays due to an emergency episode procedure carried out under the direction of the new hampshire department of environmental services division of air resources .
num .
all other delays not the contractors or departments fault or responsibility and not reasonably foreseeable or avoidable by the contractor .

the contractor is not entitled to a time extension or compensation for a nonexcusable delay .
e. concurrent delays .
concurrent delays are separate delays to critical activities occurring at the same time .
when a nonexcusable delay is concurrent with an excusable delay the contractor is not entitled to a time extension for the period the nonexcusable delay is concurrent with the excusable delay .
when a noncompensable delay is concurrent with a compensable delay the contractor is entitled to a time extension but not entitled to compensation for the period the noncompensable delay is concurrent with the compensable delay .
f. notification of delay .
in addition to the notice requirements of num.g the contractor shall provide the following detailed information when giving notice of a delay a a detailed description of the events causing delay .
b the identification of the partyies responsible for the delay and the contractual basis for this determination .

this may be attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench .
snug tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges and then the bolts of the connection shall be retightened in a similar systematic manner as necessary until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted .
num tightening .
following this initial snug tightening operation all bolts in the connection shall be tightened further by the applicable amount of rotation specified in table num .
during the tightening operation there shall be no rotation of the part not turned by the wrench .
tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
num calibratedwrench tightening .
num the calibrated wrench method includes the use of manual torque wrenches which indicate torque by means of a dial and power wrenches which are adjusted to stall at a specified tension .
calibratedwrench tightening may be used only when installation procedures are calibrated on a daily basis and when a hardened washer is used under the element turned in tightening .
this specification does not recognize standard torques determined from tables or from formulas which are assumed to relate torque to tension .
installation torque must be determined directly from calibrations performed at the job site reflecting actual work conditions .
num calibration .
when calibrated wrenches are used for installation they shall be set to provide a tension not less than five percent in excess of the minimum tension specified in table num .
the installation procedures shall be calibrated by verification testing at least once each working day for each diameter length and grade of bolt using boltnutwasher assemblies that are being installed in the work .
this verification testing shall be accomplished in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension by tightening three typical bolts of each diameter length and grade from the bolts being installed and with a hardened washer from the washers being used in the work under the element turned in tightening .
wrenches shall be recalibrated when a significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts threads nuts or washers .
num snug tightening .
when calibrated wrenches are used to install and tension bolts in a connection bolts shall be installed with hardened washers under the element turned in tightening bolts in all holes of the connection and brought to a snug tight condition see num .
num tightening .
following the initial snug tightening operation all bolts in the connection shall be tightened using the calibrated wrench to the minimum bolt installation tension in table num .
power wrenches shall be adjusted to stall or cut out at the required tension .
manual torque wrenches shall tighten the fastener to the torque value corresponding to the calibrated tension .
tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
the wrench shall be returned to touch up previously tightened bolts which may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tightening of adjacent bolts until all bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount .
if manual torque wrenches are used nuts shall be turned in the tightening direction when torque value is measured .
num verification .
wrench adjustment shall be verified during actual installation in the assembled steelwork so that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from snug tight greater than that permitted in table num .

these specifications are written to conform to procedure for verification and installation of high strength bolts with direct tension indicators dtis in appendix anum of fhwa report sanum revised april num and aashto lrfd bridge design specifications except as noted .
dtis installed with high strength bolts to indicate bolt tension shall be subjected to field verification testing num prior to installation and the installation requirements num described below .
num when direct tension indicators dtis are to be installed with highstrength bolts to indicate bolt tension the dti shall be placed under the head of the bolt with the protrusions facing the head of the bolt and the nut shall be turned to tension the fastener with a hardened washer under it .
if for reasons of installation or inspection accessibility it is necessary to place the dti under the turned element the dti shall be oriented so that the protrusions face outward from the work and a hardened washer shall be placed between the dti and the turned element .
num the bolt dti hardened washer and nut assembly used in the verification testing device and installed in the work shall be such that at least num and preferably not more than num threads are located in the grip i.e .
between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head .
num bolts used in the verification test and those installed in the work shall not be tightened to a novisible gap condition i.e .
a condition when all the dti protrusions are completely compressed .
a visible gap must remain in at least one space after installation .
it is possible to have no entries and yet have a visible gap .
the load in the bolt becomes indeterminate when no gap exists and may exceed the capacity of the fastener possibly causing bolt failure by tensioning beyond complete crushing of the dti .
num the contractor shall supply num mil tapered feeler gages a calibrated bolt tensionmeasuring device and equipment necessary to perform field verification testing and inspection of tensioned bolts .
the feeler gages fasteners and impact and manual wrenches shall be the same as that to be used in the work .
num it is mandatory that the contractor obtain the services of a qualified technical advisor employed by the dti manufacturer to make at least one site visit to assist the contractor and to assure the proper installation and use of dtis unless the contractor can demonstrate to the departments satisfaction successful use of dtis on previous projects for the department .
section num num nhdot go to toc division num division num division num division num standard division num division num division num specifications num field verification testing .
verification testing shall be performed in a calibrated bolt tensionmeasuring device skidmore with a special flat insert supplied by the contractor replacing the normal bolt headholding insert .
this special insert allows the dti to be located on the flat front face of the skidmore for ease of observation and greater access to measure the dti gap during testing .
num the purpose of verification testing is to ensure that i the dtis were properly manufactured since it is the performance of the dti that controls the installed bolt tension and that the fastener in the work will be at or above the required installation tension when the dti has been compressed to allow entries for fewer than half the number of spaces and ii the fastener in the work will not plastically deform when the dti is compressed to the maximum allowable limit for the project .
num three verification tests are required for each combination of fastener rotationalcapacity lot dti lot and dti position under the nut or bolt head used on the project .
all three tests must pass for the dti and assembly combination to be approved .
testing shall be performed at the jobsite by the contractor and witnessed by the department .
num when testing for the normal dti position the nut shall be turned and the bolt head against the dti shall be restrained from turning with another wrench .
when testing with the dti under the turned element the turned element shall be placed on the flat front face of the skidmore and the unturned element will be in the rear held by another wrench .
num the verification test shall be conducted in two stages a stage num .
the fastener shall first be tensioned to the verification tension load listed in table num for the grade and size of fastener .
if an impact wrench is used tension to a load twothirds below the required load and use a manual wrench to attain the required tension .
the loadindicating needle of the bolt calibrator can not be read accurately when an impact wrench is used due to vibrations .
b determine and record the number of entries of a num mil feeler gage in the spaces between the protrusions the number of spaces on a dti is listed in column num of table num .
the number of entries shall meet the number listed in column num of table num under verification required number of entries for the grade and size of bolt for dtis .
when using coated galvanized or epoxy coated dtis under the turned element there shall be at least one entry of the feeler gage .
the dti lot is rejected if the number of entries is less than the value in column num of the table or if for coated dtis used under the turned element there are no entries .
c stage num .
after the number of entries is recorded at the verification load the fastener shall be further tensioned with a manual wrench until there are no entries for the nummil feeler gage but a visible gap exists in at least one space .
note and record the load in the bolt at this condition the maximum allowable limit of dti compression and remove the fastener from the tensionmeasuring device .
d the capability of the bolt to tolerate the maximum allowable limit of dti compression is determined in two ways .
i the simplest is to hand turn the nut down the complete thread length of the bolt excluding thread runout .
if this is successful then the bolt has not undergone significant plastic deformation and the assembly passes the verification test .
ii if the nut can not be turned down the complete thread length the dti lot shall be rejected unless the load recorded is less than num of the average load measured in the rotational capacity test of the fastener lot as specified in article num of the aashto lrfd bridge construction specifications in which case the assembly is deemed to have passed the test .
num bolts used in verification tests shall be marked and shall not be reused in the work .
num short bolts .
if the bolt is too short to be tested in the calibration device the dti shall be tested on a longer bolt in a calibrator to determine the number of entries at the verification tension listed in column num of table num .
the number of entries shall meet the number listed in column num of table num under verification required number of entries .
another dti from the same lot shall then be assembled with the short bolt in a convenient hole in the work .
the fastener assembly shall be tensioned with a manual wrench until there are no entries for the nummil feeler gage but a visible gap exists in at least one space .
the fastener shall then be disassembled .
subsequently the nut must be run down by hand for the complete thread length of the bolt excluding thread runout .
the dti lot shall be rejected if the nut can not be assembled to this thread length .
three verification tests are required as stated above .
num installation and inspection .
installation of fasteners using dtis shall be performed in two stages initial joint snugging and final bolt tensioning .
for normal installation the bolt head against the dti shall be held against rotation during each stage of the installation while the nut is turned .
two workers are required one to operate the wrench and the other to prevent turning of the element against the dti and to monitor the gap .
a stage num joint snugging .
the connection shall first be snugged with bolts installed in all the holes of the connection and the bolts initially tensioned sufficiently to bring all the plies of the connection into firm contact while the drift .
pins remain in the connection .
snugging shall progress systematically beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges until the connection is fully compacted as described in num .
section num num nhdot go to toc division num division num division num division num standard division num division num division num specifications b dtis shall be inspected after snugging and the gaps checked .
the number of entries for a nummil feeler gage in the dti after snugging shall meet the number listed in column num of table num under verification required number of entries .
if the number of entries is less than the values in the table the fastener must be removed and another dti installed followed by resnugging of the fastener .
this is required because a fasteners tension may have relaxed during the snugging of adjacent fasteners .
a compressed dti does not rebound if the fastener tension is reduced .
if a dti were left in place which has fewer entries it would give a false indication of bolt tension .
c stage num final bolt tensioning .
the bolts in the connection shall then be further tensioned to the point that the number of entries for a nummil feeler gage meets the number listed in table num under installation required number of entries .
tightening shall progress systematically beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges .
drift .
pins shall be removed during this process .
several cycles may be required .
if the fastener is tightened so that no visible gap in any space remains the bolt and dti shall be removed and replaced by a new properly tightened fastener and dti .
d an additional required inspection step is to check the bolt thread stickout on the nut side after installation to the final specified gap to look for inconsistency of pattern .
any stickouts greater than the other bolts shall be investigated and discarded e.g .
if necking down of the bolt has occurred or the wrong length bolt was used .
the end of the properly installed bolt shall be at least flush with the nut or stick out not more than three threads .

snugtight condition equal to approximately num percent of the required fastener tension and then to the minimum tension specified in table num .
there shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt .
