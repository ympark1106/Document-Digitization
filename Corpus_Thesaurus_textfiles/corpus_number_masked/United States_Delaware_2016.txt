num withholding of money due on an estimate to offset a contractors liability .
whenever liquidated damages are assessable such damages will be deducted from the monthly and final estimate .
the payment of any current or final estimate or of any retained percentage shall in no way affect the obligation of the contractor to repair or renew any defective parts of the construction and to be responsible for all damage due to such defects .
if at any time there is evidence of any lien or claim for which if established the department might become liable and which is chargeable to the contractor the department will have the right to retain out of any payment then due or to become due an amount sufficient to completely indemnify the department against such lien or claim .

the balance of the amount retained will be held until all reports required of the contractor are received and final payment is authorized by the department .
the department may at its option retain temporarily or permanently a smaller amount and may cause the contractor to be paid temporarily or permanently from time to time such portion of the amount retained as it deems equitable .
no provision contained in these specifications shall be construed as creating any debt liability or obligation on the part of the state or department to any subcontractor supplier or materialman .
num final payment time limit to challenge quantities .

all prior partial estimates and payments will be subject to correction in the final estimate payment .
give notice to the engineer of any alleged errors in the payment of contract quantities .
such notice must be given to the engineer within num calendar days of the date when the engineer gives the contractor notice that the contracts quantities have been finalized .
failure to notify the engineer within this time frame constitutes a waiver of the contractors right to contest the quantities .
nothing in this section serves to preclude the engineer from performing audits of its own records or the contractors records and to adjust payment based on such audits in accordance with other provisions in the specifications .
the acceptance by the contractor of the final estimate operates as and is a release to the state the department the secretary and its agents from all claims of liability under the contract or for anything done or furnished or relating to the work under the contract or for any act or neglect of the state the department the secretary or its agents relating to or connected with the contract .

the design shown in the plans is based on the most conservative stream diversion approach anticipated at the time of bid i.e .
the largest footprint needed to complete the work .
make every effort to implement the design within the limits shown on the plans without additional impacts to the stream or wetland depicted on the environmental compliance sheets .
if additional stream andor wetland impacts are necessary submit a preliminary layout of the impacts to the engineer .
obtain written permission before proceeding with final design .
assume all cost of design and construction of alternate plans .
the design of the alternate plans must comply with all applicable hydrologic and hydraulic engineering standards in effect when preparing the proposed alternative stream diversion plan regarding capacity of the system and potential surface water impacts upstream and downstream of the stream diversion .
if permission is granted to proceed with final design of a proposal for an alternate stream diversion prepare and submit the alternate in accordance with section num of the standard specifications .
