preface publication date march num this book provides a compilation of approved standard specifications for use in the departments highway construction contracts .
these standard specifications have been prepared and adopted under the authority of alaska statute num and conform as closely as practicable to the guide specifications for highway construction published by the american association of state highway and transportation officials .
these specifications are intended for use only with contracts designed in united states customary english units .
these specifications will be incorporated by reference into each highway construction contract and will be supplemented as necessary by standard modification and special provisions included in the contract being advertised for bids .
a summary of changes to this edition of the standard specifications for highway construction is available for information purposes only through the dotpf statewide design engineering services division .
