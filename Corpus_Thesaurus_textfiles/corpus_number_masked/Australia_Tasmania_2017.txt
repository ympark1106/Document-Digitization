an unanticipated discovery plan is required to ensure appropriate response in the event that an item site or object of aboriginal cultural heritage is discovered that could not have otherwise been anticipated .
the following is a guide to the most common aboriginal cultural heritage site types in tasmania and will assist in identifying and managing the unanticipated discovery of aboriginal cultural heritage sites and objects .
stone artefact scatters a stone artefact is any stone or rock which has been modified by aboriginal people .
often this is the result of fracturing or flaking fine grained rocks to produce sharp cutting or scrapping implements .
the most common stone types utilised by tasmanian aboriginal people are silcrete and chert on account of their availability and excellent tool making properties .
however we also find hornfels chalcedony spongelite quartzite and other stone types where locally available .
in tasmania stone artefacts are typically recorded as being isolated i.e .
only one or in a scatter i.e .
two or more within a numm radius .
stone artefacts are found all over tasmania in all landscapes and situations and are the most basic indicator of aboriginal occupation .
shell middens middens are occupational deposits created through an accumulation of debris from human activity .
midden sites can range in size from large mounds to small scatters of shell .
the most common shellfish species found in middens in tasmania are abalone oyster mussel warrener and limpet however they can also contain other debris such as animal bone charcoal from campfires and discarded tools made from stone shell or bone these sites are usually found near waterways and coastal areas .
rockshelters caves and rock overhangs which bear signs of human activity are for the purpose of the aboriginal heritage register ahr collectively called occupied rock shelters .
aboriginal people utilised these places for shelter ceremony and other cultural practices leaving behind occupational deposits such as middens and hearths tools or in some cases rock markings .
rock shelters are usually found where the geology is conducive to the formation of caves and rock overhangs .
quarries or stone procurement sites a quarry is a place where material has been extracted from a natural outcrop by aboriginal people .
the two types of quarry recorded on the ahr are stone and ochre each typically being located wherever suitable ochre for painting and decoration or stone for toolmaking appear .
quarries can be recognised by evidence of human manipulation and by the debris left behind from processing the material .
quarries can be extensive or discrete depending on the size and quality of the outcrop and how often it was utilised and visited .
rock marking rock marking is the term used in tasmania to define markings on rocks which are the result of aboriginal practices .
rock markings come in two forms engraving and painting .
engravings are made by removing the surface of a rock through pecking abrading or grinding whilst paintings are made by adding pigment or ochre to the surface of a rock .
department of state growth may num section num page num of num department of state growth burials burial sites are highly sensitive places .
they can occur anywhere and have previously been recorded in sand dunes shell middens and rock shelters b protection of values areas of nominated archaeological andor heritage values identified to be retained shall be identified as nogo zones and protected by temporary fencing and signage .
no signage is to identify the nature of the nogo zone .
hp prior to removing any vegetation the contractor shall arrange an onsite inspection with the superintendent and other relevant authorities to confirm and clearly identify the arears of nominated archaeological andor heritage values to be protected and shall fence and sign all nogo zones .
c unanticipated discovery plan the contractor shall as a minimum comply with the following procedures which are provided as a guide to meeting the obligations established under the aboriginal relics act num and the coroners act num in regard to dealing with unanticipated discoveries of aboriginal cultural heritage such as sites and objects .
the first section details the process to be followed should any aboriginal cultural heritage item site or object be discovered excluding skeletal remains burials while the second section details the process should skeletal remains burials be discovered .
discovery of cultural heritage items step num any person who believes they have uncovered aboriginal cultural heritage material should notify all employees or contractors that are working in the immediate area that all earth disturbance works must cease immediately .
step num a temporary nogo or buffer zone of at least numm x numm should be implemented to protect the suspected aboriginal cultural heritage site or relics .
no unauthorised entry or works will be allowed within this nogo zone until the suspected aboriginal cultural heritage relics have been assessed by a recognised aboriginal heritage practitioner .
step num aboriginal heritage tasmania aht in hobart ph num num needs to be notified and consulted as soon as possible and informed of the discovery .
aht will then provide further advice in accordance with the aboriginal relics act num .
discovery of skeletal material step num call the police immediately .
under no circumstances should the suspected skeletal remains be touched or disturbed .
the area must now be considered a crime scene .
it is a criminal offence to interfere with a crime scene .
step num any person who believes they have uncovered skeletal material should notify all employees or contractors that are working in the immediate area that all earth disturbance works must cease immediately .
step num a temporary nogo or buffer zone of at least numm x numm should be implemented to protect the suspected skeletal remains .

initial treatments constructed as a prime and seal are generally regarded as a superior treatment and more economical than primersealfinal seal treatments .
priming however is generally restricted to the months of october to april and to roads constructed clear of traffic although it can be used in a half width sequence for roads with less than num vehicles per day .
a prime normally has no cover aggregate but may be gritted or sanded after about num hours in locations where traffic detours are not possible or to allow access to properties .
priming is also used on concrete surfaces prior to sealing or placing of asphalt surfacing .
a prime consists of a light grade of cut back bitumen with a low viscosity which enables it to penetrate the surface of most dry pavements and if applied at the correct rate of application it will leave a thin skin of bitumen on the pavement surface .
the prime tends to bind the fine particles of pavement together to form a clean dust free surface promoting a strong bond between the pavement and the following seal or asphalt surfacing .
the primed surface can be lightly trafficked for one to two weeks prior to sealing if required .
in warm dry conditions a prime can cure in num hours but can take up to a week in cooler conditions .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads bitumen emulsion may be used as an alternative to cutback bitumen and is particularly suited to applications where the subsequent seal is required to be placed within a short period of time or where works need to be undertaken in less favourable weather conditions .
b primersealing a primerseal is an initial treatment used to provide a temporary seal over new construction .
primersealing is used in preference to priming at sites constructed under traffic or where priming is not practicable due to damp cold conditions .
a final seal must be applied to the primerseal within num to num years .
a primerbinder consists of a medium grade of cut back bitumen having a viscosity low enough to provide some penetration of the granular pavement surface but high enough to sufficiently wet and retain a small to medium sized aggregate .
primerseals constructed with cutback bitumen should not be resealed until after a reasonable period of curing typically a minimum of num to num years as any residual volatile oil can affect the subsequent treatment .
primerseals typically achieve significantly less penetration when compared to primes and generally rely predominantly on adhesion to the pavement hence the condition of the surface prior to sealing is critical .
bitumen emulsion may be used as an alternative to cutback bitumen and is particularly suited to applications where the final seal or asphalt surfacing is required to be placed within a short period of time because it does not contain any cutter .
c sealing sealing is the application of binder and aggregate to a primed or primersealed surface initial treatment seal or final seal or to an existing sealed surface reseal .
a seal binder may comprise either cut back bitumen or bitumen emulsions which can be modified to enhance performance .
the most common aggregate sizes used are num num or num with the occasional use of size num in conjunction with sizes num or num as part of a double application treatment .
traditionally the vast majority of sealing and resealing works are undertaken with cut back bitumen however bitumen emulsions can be used as an alternative but have different handling and placement characteristics .
additional notes on selection of aggregate size and sprayed seal type are provided below .
selection of aggregate size a sealing the choice of aggregate size for sealing can be an important factor in the success or otherwise of a seal .
if the surface to be resealed is highly textured a size num or num aggregate is normally used whereas if the surface has low surface texture a size num or num aggregate may be appropriate .
it is generally not economical to use an aggregate larger than size num for roads with less than num vpd and for sealed shoulders .
a size num aggregate or larger should not be used in urban areas where increased traffic noise could be a problem .
a number of austroads guides are also available to assist in treatment selection .
b primersealing the choice of aggregate size for primersealing is usually related to traffic volume and expected life .
as a general guide a size num primerseal is suitable for roads with a traffic volume of generally less than num vpd whereas a size num primerseal is suitable for roads with more than num vpd .
above num vpd more robust primerseal may be required including doubledouble applications andor the use of polymer modified binders .
a primerseal has an average life of between one and two years although longer may be achievable from more robust primerseal treatments may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads choice of seal type conventional seal c a conventional seal using class num bitumen binder should generally provide a satisfactory result for sound pavements without steep grades sharp curves and large numbers of truck turning movements and where the annual average daily traffic aadt over a num hour period does not exceed around num vpd .
high stress seal hss hss seals can be divided up into two types hssnum and hssnum .
hssnum is used to designate a singlesingle seal while a hssnum designates a doubledouble seal .
both types of hss are used for improved aggregate retention in high stress areas such as areas of turning traffic steep grades sharp curves and high speed roads .
hssnum seals are suitable for roads up to num vpdlane but can also provide good performance on straight or undulating roads with up to num vpdlane with low proportions of commercial vehicles num .
hssnum seals are more appropriate for roads with higher traffic volumes and more stressed locations such as steeper grades smaller radius curves and higher proportions of commercial vehicles .
both hssnum and hssnum use a lightly modified polymer modified binder pmb such as class snume class snume or cnum bitumen modified in the field with num parts crumb rubber per num parts of bitumen .
a slightly higher rate of application is used for an hss as consistency of the modified binder is greater than a conventional binder .
in the case of a hssnum the default practice is to use the same modified binder in both applications but in some cases where a doubledouble seal is necessary but lesser levels of performance are required conventional binders can also be used for the second binder application .
an hss usually produces a more consistent surface than conventional seals for surfaces with variable surface texture .
similar spraying practices are used for an hss as for a conventional seal .
extreme stress seal xss xss seals are a variation to the hssnum seals designed to cope with higher stress situations imposed by parameters such as heavy traffic volumes num vpdlane high proportions of commercial vehicles steep grades and tight radius curves .
such treatments are generally appropriate for major freeways and highways heavily trafficked arterial roads as well as lesser roads in mountainous areas where high shear loading may be present and a sprayed seal treatment is considered appropriate .
these are always placed as a doubledouble application most commonly with a num mm aggregate combination .
a highly modified binder such as snume snumr or snumrf is used in both binder applications .
like hss seals these usually produce a more consistent surface than conventional seals for surfaces with variable texture .
strain alleviating membrane sam sam seals are used where there is a need for enhanced performance waterproofing properties or to delay the propagation of cracks on moderately cracked pavements .
sam seals incorporate about num of elastomeric pmb or about num parts of crumbed rubber per num parts of bitumen equivalent to num .
typical binder classes include snumr snume and snumrf .
the increased consistency and elasticity of the binder allow heavier binder application rates and provide greater resistance to reflective cracking .
snume or snume binder classes can also be used as binders in sam applications although they offer a lower level of modification and should be reserved for lesser cracked pavements .
a minimum binder application rate of num lmnum is deemed necessary for a sam treatment to be effective .
strain alleviating membrane interlayer sami sami treatments are used as an interlayer under asphalt surfacing to provide increased waterproofing andor resistance to reflective cracking when placed over a cracked pavement .
a sami treatment used in conjunction with a thin or ultrathin asphalt surfacing is sometimes referred to as a combination or composite surfacing treatment .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads a sami comprises a heavy application of a very highly modified binder such as snume or snumrf with a very light cover of size num aggregate to allow the passage of traffic until the asphalt surfacing is placed .
sami treatments are generally not trafficked hence use a lighter application of aggregate relative to other seals to allow for construction traffic .
in some circumstances a sami may need to be trafficked for a short period of time in which case it should be designed to be closer to a sam treatment .
it is important that there is no loose aggregate remaining on the surface at the time of asphalt placement to ensure a strong bond between the sami and the asphalt surfacing .
a minimum binder application rate of num lmnum is deemed necessary for a sami treatment to be effective .
geotextile reinforced seal grs a grs is a seal incorporating a nonwoven needle punched paving fabric to reinforce the seal and allow a significantly higher rate of binder application an additional num lm² of binder is soaked up by the fabric .
a grs is normally used to waterproof and extend pavement life of severely cracked pavements or as a sami treatment under a thin asphalt surfacing .
double application seals are preferred to single application seals as they provide a more robust treatment with better resistance to turning traffic and are less prone to stripping .
aggregate sizes for double application seals are commonly num .
a grs can be also used as a sami treatment as an alternative to a highly modified binder over severely cracked pavements and will provide a higher level of resistance to cracking .
in this circumstance they are placed with a single layer of aggregate usually a size num mm to allow for construction traffic .
the binder used is usually cnum bitumen although bitumen emulsions and pmbs may be used for specific purposes and need to be specified in table num .
pmbs however should not be used in the bond coat .
fibre reinforced seal frs an frs is a proprietary sprayed sealing treatment consisting of a layer of glass fibre strands sandwiched between two coats of a polymer modified bituminous emulsion .
the fibres are applied randomly to form a mat that resists the onset of reflective cracking .
finally a layer of aggregate is spread and rolled in the conventional manner .
an frs is also used for severely cracked pavements in a similar manner to a sam seal or grs .
frs is reported to be superior to a sam seal but less so than a grs .
an frs is more suitable than grs for sharp curves where placement of the geotextile fabric is likely to develop kinks and creases .
this specification does not specifically cover frs product requirements but the acceptance criteria specified in clause num still apply .
similarly an frs can also be used as an alternative to a geotextile as a sami treatment .
surface enrichment se an se is a low cost seal treatment for highly textured surfaces with little or no traffic .
the process involves the spraying of a light application of cut back bitumen or bitumen emulsion to the surface without application of additional aggregate .
an se is particularly suited to sealed shoulders that can be closed to traffic for num or num days .
it is most important that an se is applied in good weather conditions to ensure that it cures rapidly and minimise the risk of bituminous material washing off after heavy rain and damaging the environment .
double application treatments for high stress areas double application doubledouble seal treatments provide a stronger surfacing capable of withstanding abrasive forces caused by turning and braking traffic .
a double application seal usually consists of a size num first coat followed by a size num top coat .
other combinations such as num or num can be considered for special applications but should not be used without prior consultation with vicroads technical consulting .
the size of aggregate used for the second application should not be more than half the nominal size of aggregate used for the first application .
doubledouble application treatments are commonly used for initial treatments on rural freeways or in grs applications .
a slightly different design process applies to double application seals where the second application is applied immediately compared to double application seals where the second application is delayed until after a period of trafficking .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads a further form of double application seal is that of a singledouble .
it involves a single application of binder with two applications of aggregate .
the first application of larger size aggregate is followed by a second application of aggregate about half the size of the first .
this process is often termed racking in where the fine aggregate penetrates into voids between the coarse aggregate particles locking the coarse aggregate particles in place .
the procedure is also often used for moderately trafficked intersections and at private entrances with large heavy vehicles .
programming of sealing works ensuring sprayed bituminous surfacing works are undertaken at an appropriate time of year is a key factor in the long term success of treatments .
generally the more elaborate treatments i.e .
use of highly modified binders or geotextiles the greater risk of failure if they are applied in less favourable conditions .
as such these types of treatments should be prioritised for the best weather conditions i.e .
typically december to february particularly on high risk or high profile sites .
guidance as to the suggested sealing periods for various treatments is provided below .
however some regions with areas in the northern parts of the state which are generally warmer for longer may be able to further extend when their treatments are undertaken .
similarly some of the alpine and southern cooler areas of the state such as the otway ranges for example may need to shorten the periods when more complex treatments can be undertaken .
local knowledge and judgement should also be used .

with careful treatment selection and application initial treatments can generally be placed in less favourable conditions particularly with the use of emulsions as long as all other specification requirements can be met e.g .
pavement dryback .
guidance as to the appropriate treatment selection and timeframes for placement on pavements constructed clear of traffic is provided in vicroads code of practice rcnum code of practice for selection and design of pavements and surfacings appendix c table cnum .
in some cases it may be necessary to undertake bituminous surfacing work outside the optimum conditions .
in some cases this can still achieve a satisfactory outcome with careful treatment selection and planning however advice should be sought from vicroads technical consulting .
specifying restrictions on work consideration needs to be given to the potential programming inefficiencies that may result from restrictions which may increase the costs of sealing works .
this should however be weighed up against the reduced risks for vicroads and contractors of treatments failing and requiring costly rework of defects .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads restrictions on works in specific locations due to special events tourist holiday periods etc .
may also need to be considered .
care needs to be taken to not be over prescriptive and ensure that works can still be reasonably and economically programmed .

cold wet weather is a further factor that can increase the risk of failure typically stripping of sprayed seal treatments particularly special treatments such as strain alleviating membrane sam seals and geotextile reinforced seals grs .
generally sprayed sealing work should be programmed to be undertaken in the warmer months october to may to minimise the risks associated with cold damp conditions .
num limits of work nearly all vicroads sealing contracts are lump sum contracts that require the limits of work to be marked on the main carriageways and at side roads .
for existing sealed pavements this is normally done using hand sprayed painted arrows on the pavement .
for new pavements not yet constructed drawings need to be available in sufficient detail to enable the areas of various elements of the job to be accurately determined to enable the schedule of details clause num to be completed .
unless otherwise specified scheduled areas of work are normally required to be measured and calculated to an accuracy of num or of the actual area sprayed otherwise a contract variation to the lump sum is applicable .
where the area of work can not be marked out to an accuracy of num the relevant level of accuracy should be included in a contract specific clause .
however the appropriate level of accuracy is usually readily calculated as part of the vicroads process of marking out the limits of work .
reference should be made to the road management act num code of practice for operational responsibility for public roads for assistance in defining the job limits for reseals that extend on to side streets and intersecting roads .
num inclusion and deletion of job items when preparing the contract schedule it is important not to include too many uncertain jobs that may be removed from the contract by way of variation as reductions in the total value of the contract by more than num may lead to a claim for additional payment .
if there is uncertainty about the number of jobs that may be deducted from the contract consideration could be given to developing a list of unscheduled jobs that may be added to the contract to offset the value of deductions .
num calibration of bitumen sprayers all bitumen sprayers must have a current calibration certificate valid for num months from the date of testing which should be located within the vehicle .
certificates of calibration are acceptable from any testing organisation suitably qualified to undertake the relevant tests including test facilities located in other states of australia .
a listing of current calibrated sprayers is maintained on the australian asphalt pavement association aapa website www.aapa.asn.au under the heading of technical .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads num bituminous materials most of the bituminous and other materials required for sprayed sealing are manufactured to meet an australian standard or austroads specification framework .
however if new or alternative products are offered or tendered the advice of vicroads technical consulting should be obtained .
generally the contractor is required to provide evidence of satisfactory field performance of alternative products for a period of at least three years although new and untried products may also be allowed on a trial basis under certain conditions .
a adhesion agent adhesion agent is chemical agent that is added to either the binder or aggregate precoating material to improve the adhesion of bitumen to aggregate .
adhesion agent is usually more effective if added to the aggregate precoating material particularly if aggregate is being field precoated as part of the aggregate screening and loading operation .
for wet aggregates including wet plant precoated aggregate adhesion agent is also added to the binder .
advice should be provided by the manufacturers in regard to the concentration of adhesion agent required to be added the binder or precoating material which must be supported by evidence of satisfactory field performance .
this evidence should include results of testing for effectiveness of adhesion of binder on a range of aggregate types using vicroads test method num. b aggregate precoating material guidance on selection of aggregate precoating material is provided in the notes to clause numb .
c bitumen class num bitumen complying with as num is used for all conventional seals .
conventional seals make up the large majority of seals on sound pavements for roads with relatively low traffic and low stress locations .
d bitumen emulsion bitumen emulsion comprises around num to num bitumen in an aqueous solution of bitumen colloids water and a small volume of emulsifier .
basic grades comply with as num .
cationic rapid setting crs emulsion is generally preferred for sealing work .
various proprietary grades of emulsion are also available offering benefits in terms of higher viscosity for retention of larger aggregate sizes or the incorporation of polymer modified binders for enhanced performance .
bitumen emulsion seals can be up to num more costly than conventional cut back bitumen seals but may be considered for a range of applications including a light primer seal prior to an asphalt surfacing in lieu of a cutback bitumen prime or primerseal essential where asphalt is to be placed within num months primes and primer seals on new works a second application of a two application primerseal an emergency reseal during cool weather to prevent further deterioration of a failing seal or primerseal for num mm and num mm reseals particularly in cooler months where conventional cnum bitumen seals would require an excessive amount of cutting oil and an increased risk of bleeding or flushing problems the following summer .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads e cutback bitumen cutback bitumen used for sealing is usually field produced by the addition of cutter cutting oil at the site immediately prior to sealing .
cutter is used to temporarily reduce the viscosity of a binder in cooler weather to achieve an even distribution of binder across the pavement and more importantly to achieve initial adhesion to and proper embedment of aggregate into the binder .
the proportion of cutter is dependent on the specific pavement temperature and ambient conditions .
austroads ap tnum sprayed seal cutting practice and the austroadsaapa work tips nos .
num and num provide useful information on this subject .
cutter should not be added at a central depot as the amount is dependent on temperature conditions at the time of day the spraying of each sprayer load commences .
excessive cutter can lead to bleeding or flushing of the completed seal during hot weather whereas insufficient cutter can result poor distribution of binder to the pavement and poor initial aggregate adhesion .
cutback bitumen used for priming and primersealing may be field produced on the day but is mostly produced in a central location to either as num standard grades or to a proprietary specification proprietary grades .
proprietary grades may differ slightly from standard grades but may be accepted on the basis of previous demonstrated satisfactory performance .
f cutter cutting oil the most common type of cutter used is high flash point hfp cutter which has been specifically developed for sprayed sealing work .
hfp cutters are less costly and are safer to transport and handle than lower flash point cutters such as aviation fuel or normal kerosene .
there are numerous proprietary grades of cutting oil available .
g flux oil not to be used the role of flux oil is to achieve a longer term softening of the binder for lightly trafficked roads aadt num vehicles per lane to assist in aggregate embedment over a longer period and to delay the onset of age hardening of the bitumen binder .
as num provides for two grades of flux oil .
num .
light flux oil distillate or distillate based product num .
heavy flux oil heavy fuel oil in practice it has been found that there is little difference in the long term softening effects of light flux oils such as distillate and that of hfp cutter .
recent practice therefore has been to use a further num or num parts cutter for low trafficked roads in addition to requirements for pavement temperature in place of flux oil .
if flux oil is required in preference to additional cutter it must be specified in the other requirements column of table num or by use of a special clause .
table a below should also be inserted into the special clause .
note that clause numg provides for the use of heavy flux oil only .

the most commonly used fabric for general applications has a minimum mass of num gmnum but a num gmnum fabric is available for special applications such as large aggregate sizes greater than num mm or for use as an initial treatment on unbound granular pavements .
geotextile fabrics are manufactured from polyester or polypropylene .
polyester fabric is preferred for use with hot binders as it has a much higher melting point .
polypropylene fabric is generally restricted to bitumen emulsion treatments .
the manufacturer is required to provide advice on the absorption characteristics of the fabric so that an appropriate allowance can be made in the design procedure .
normally geotextile fabrics have a binder absorption rate ranging from num to num litresmnum .
geotextile fabrics are usually available from the manufacturer in a standard widths of up to num m by up to num m long but can also be ordered in custom widths and lengths if a nonstandard size are required .
it is preferable to not trim widths on site and the correct widths for the job should be ordered from the manufacturer .
it is important for rolls of geotextile fabric to be stored in a dry location and out of direct sunlight .
i polymer modified binder pmb clause numi provides nominated classes of pmb for various treatments .
if a different or particular class pmb is required it must be specified in the other requirements column of table num .
the austroads specification framework for polymer modified binders and multigrade bitumens agpttnum lists a wide range of pmb classes it is not practical for the manufacturers to make all classes of pmb available at all times .
the default grades are generally regarded as the most commonly used pmbs with the crumb rubber classes being the most common .
if another type of pmb is required other than one of the default grades pmb suppliers should be contacted to ensure that it can be made available in sufficient quantities .
some pmbs may not meet all the specified requirements of agpttnum and are regarded as unclassified many of which are often proprietary products .
if an unclassified pmb is proposed for use evidence is required to show that it has produced seal treatments with a satisfactory history of performance over a period of at least num years .
if in doubt regarding the selection of different classes of pmbs or the use of unclassified pmbs advice should be sought from the vicroads technical consulting .
j prime the contractor is required to select a grade of prime depending on the porosity of the pavement and how tightly bound the surface is after preparation .
heavy and very heavy grades of prime are required for porous types of materials such as sandstone and limestone and for surfaces lacking in fines or natural cementation .
some types of crushed rock particularly those that are paver laid can lack sufficient fines to provide a tightly bound surface and may also require the use of a heavier grade of primer or primerbinder .
if local knowledge and experience has shown that a specific grade of prime produces the desired result it may be specified in the other requirements column of table num .
table b below provides some typical standard grades of prime that may be considered .

table d below which is reproduced from the guide notes for section num provides a guide to selection of aggregate class .
further guidance on selection of aggregates is provided in the notes to section num .
table d selection of aggregate class traffic volume aadt aggregate class assigned polished stone value min more than num vehicles or more than num commercial vehicles a num or num all other traffic levels b num or num assigned psv to be obtained from department of state growth sections num and section num must be included in all specifications for sprayed sealing .
if sand aggregate is to be specified for any reason such as for covering of primer at entrances or as part of racking in procedure section num must also be included .
class a aggregate has a minimum polished stone value psv of num which is satisfactory in most heavily trafficked situations .
for high accident locations on heavily trafficked roads with an aadt in excess of num vehicleslaneday a psv of num may be specified provided that a suitable supply is available and economically feasible to transport .
if in doubt advice should be sought from vicroads technical consulting .
b aggregate precoat precoating of aggregates is used to assist in overcoming adverse effects of dust and moisture on the adhesion between aggregates and binder .
all aggregate for sealing must be precoated prior to use but precoating is not generally required for primersealing .
aggregate can be either field precoated with a distillate based precoating material as part of the aggregate loading operation or plant precoated with a very light cutback bitumen at the aggregate source prior to delivery .
plant precoating with cutback bitumen is preferred to site precoating particularly for heavy trafficked roads and for roads in high rainfall locations where aggregates becomes wet in stockpiles .
if plant precoated aggregate is required it must be specified in table num as follows yplant if plant or field applied precoated aggregate is required it must be specified in table num as follows y if precoated aggregate is not required e.g .
for primerseals it must be specified in table num as follows n may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads num use of stacksites stacksites are critical for the storage of sealing aggregates and can often also be utilised as a staging area for transferring mixing and heating binders as well as parking of plant and equipment .
generally vicroads will make nominated stacksites typically within the road reserve available for the contractor to utilise to carry out its works .
a contractor may also elect to make its own arrangements to use sites managed by councils or other authoritiesproperty owners and it is the contractors responsibility to seek approval and adhere to any associated requirements .
the management of stacksites across vicroads has varied from region to region however due to a recent incident and subsequent workcover investigation and resulting provisional improvement notice vicroads now has in place a stacksite management procedure qd num that requires annual inspection and assessment of stacksites .
this procedure also requires all contractors or relevant parties accessing stack sites under their control to have a swms in place which should be checked against a provided swms checklist .
num application of bituminous material aggregate and geotextiles a design rates of application the contractor is required to determine the design rates of application for binder and aggregate in accordance with aptnum update of the austroads sprayed seal design method and the associated num update to the doubledouble design method aptnum or later version as listed in section num .
for tendering purposes vicroads is required to insert a default rate of application of bituminous material .
if the contractors design rate of application is different to the default rate the lump sum for that job item can be adjusted in increments of num litresmnum above or below the default rate of application .
refer to section num clauses in the shell document for further information .
default rates of application for aggregate are not specified as the contractor is required to determine the rate of application to suit the aggregate size and if applicable the average least dimension ald .
it is important that the correct design rate of application of aggregate is used .
if the aggregate spread rate is too heavy it will result a surplus of loose aggregate particles .
the combination of surplus aggregate particles and heavy traffic tends to grind and break down the aggregate in the sprayed seal .
if the aggregate spread rate is too light satisfactory aggregate particle interlock may not be achieved resulting in ongoing dislodging of aggregate particles from the binder under heavy traffic stripping .
the contractor should therefore apply aggregate at or close to the design aggregate spread rate with minimum overlap to ensure a minimum of surplus aggregate and a spread rate sufficient enough to provide adequate aggregate particle interlock .
tables enum enum and enum and footnotes are provided as a guide to determination of default rates of application of bituminous materials .

num application rates for prime and primerbinder refer to total volume including cutter at numc .
for bitumen emulsion primerbinders the application rates should be increased by approximately num for num bitumen emulsions and num for num bitumen emulsions respectively .
num it is usually more economical to use heavier grades of prime or primerbinder on known porous pavements rather than specifying abnormally high rates of application .
num typical rates of application for primerbinder and binder do not include any allowances and should be used as a guide only for tendering purposes .
where it is not possible to inspect the site and make an assessment of the surface texture a default allowance of num lmnum may be used .
num increase base rates given in the table enum by num for hss and xss and num for sam seals .
num add num lmnum to the rates given on table enum for a geotextile reinforced seal .
b surface pretreatment the contractor is required to nominate the application rate for pretreatment as part of the design process outlined in clause numa .
to assist in this requirement vicroads has agreed with the industry to list in table num where pretreatment is most likely to be required .
every attempt should be made to comply with this agreement .
typical rates for application of bituminous binder used as pre treatment are num num lm² .
failure to nominate all pretreatments however does not relieve the contractor of responsibility for determining the need for pretreatment in order to meet the specified requirements for surface texture and aggregate loss .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads surfaces requiring pretreatment typically involve wheel paths with significantly less texture depth than areas outside the wheelpaths .
the austroads sprayed seal design method requires binder application rates to be designed for the wheelpath traffic and surface condition .
this can result in insufficient binder to hold aggregate in the coarser textured areas outside the wheel paths .
a common procedure for correcting this condition is to prespray the additional binder required in the coarse textured areas and then apply the design binder application rate across the full lane or road width .
suitable techniques for prespraying are described in vicroads technical note num .
an alternative to prespraying is the use of a specially designed bitumen sprayer that can apply a variable binder distribution across the width of the spray bar .
regardless of the method of application used the contractor is required to separately determine the design binder application rate for wheelpaths and the additional binder application rate for the remainder of the spray width .
contractors using variable distribution sprayers must be able to demonstrate the means by which the variation in binder application rate is verified and show both the individual design rates and the total amount of binder sprayed for each run in the job completion report clause num .
some road surfaces may require more extensive pretreatment than a simple transverse variation in binder application rate specialised treatments include a surface voids filling seal consisting of a fine aggregate and binder applied at the base rate of application a few weeks prior to reseal solvent and grit treatments to treat flushed areas a few weeks prior to sealing techniques for solvent and grit treatment are described in vicroads technical note num dry matting involving the spreading of a thin layer of loose aggregate in flushed or partially stripped areas prior to a further application of binder and aggregate techniques for the application of dry matting technique to stripped seals are described in vicroads technical note num .
these specialised treatments should always be specified as separate schedule items .
they require particular care in application and should only be used after consultation with vicroads technical consulting .
surface pretreatment in sprayed sealing contracts is intended only for the correction of variations in surface texture and does not extend to the correction of defects such as pavement weakness potholes wide cracks surface shape or extensive areas of severe surface bleeding .
pavement repair work if required should be carried well in advance of any sealing work to allow repair work to properly cure and prove in quality by the passage of traffic .
d minimum temperature the viscosity of bitumen changes with temperature which is an important consideration for the longer term performance of sprayed seals as lower viscosities are required for initial wetting and adhesion to pavements and sealing aggregates .
in cool temperatures binders rapidly cool which reduces wetting effects and adhesion .
temperatures provided in table num are considered the minimum values based on various aapa and austroads guides however undertaking works in such conditions still have a heightened risk of poor performance relative to warmer conditions and does not absolve the contractor of the other seal performance requirements .
crumb rubber binders can be used at slightly lower temperature as the surface of the binders do not tend to skin on the surface when sprayed like many pmbs when used in lower temperatures .
this discourages adhesion of the aggregate and can lead to stripping .
the one exception to this is snume grade pmb where the manufacturer uses a pbd type polymer rather than sbs .
these have been found to still provide reasonable adhesion in cooler conditions similar to crumb rubber .
pmb specifications are nonspecific on the type of polymer i.e .
sbs or pbd and snume binders can utilise either to achieve the specification requirements of this grade of binder .
as such specialist advice from technical services should be sought if this issue arises .
it should also be noted that whilst the application of a prime treatment can be undertaken at a relatively low temperature ongoing low temperatures will result in a prime that will not set up and cure and should generally be avoided during the cooler months i.e .
late autumn and winter .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads e forward aggregate spreading the purpose of the introduction of forward spreading aggregate techniques is to provide a safer work place for the performing of sprayed sealing operations hence vicroads is facilitating and encouraging the introduction of forward moving aggregate operations from num july num. i transition period a num year transition period to allow the purchase and commissioning of appropriate plant by contractors has been introduced with a requirement for all aggregate spreading operations to be carried out in the forward direction from num july num .
to complement the introduction of this initiative the following incentives have been adopted num all sealing works delivered prior to num july num shall have a value recognition of an additional payment of num cents per square metre sealed for the use of forward aggregate spreading techniques above the tendered schedule num amount num all sealing works delivered prior to num july num shall have an early adopters incentive of an additional payment of num cents per square metre sealed for the use of forward aggregate spreading techniques above the tendered schedule num amount num for all sealing works delivered after num july num the forward aggregate spreading requirements shall be mandatory for all sprayed sealing works and any additional costs if determined by the contractor shall be included in schedule num of the tender .
it is proposed that an evaluation of the process be undertaken in cooperation with appa at the end of the first two years of operation .
ii vehicles qualifying for the incentives num items of plant that qualify for consideration under this agreement include synchronised sprayers that both spray bituminous binders and spread aggregates as part of the one forward moving operation .
these plant items are sometimes referred to as chipsealers or one step machines .
aggregate cover trucks or vehicles that spread aggregate from the front of the vehicle whilst travelling in a forward direction only .
self propelled aggregate spreaders that do not have the ability to spread aggregate whilst reversing .
note these machines only qualify whilst being loaded by front or side discharging vehicles or being loaded by rear discharge vehicles whilst stationary .
other plant items may be submitted to the superintendent for approval subject to meeting all the requirements of the specification .
num items of plant that do not qualify for consideration under this agreement include all vehicles that discharge aggregate whilst reversing .
this includes reversing tip trucks live bottom trucks that discharge aggregate while operating in reverse and any truck that reverses into a hopper of a machine that in turn spreads aggregate whilst travelling forwards e.g .
self propelled aggregate spreaders .
any tipping truck that lifts the top of the tray or any other part of the vehicle above num m from ground level .
all plant which the contractor is proposing to seek incentive payments under the forward spreading aggregate program shall be approved by the superintendent prior to the plant being used on site .
for any item of plant to be approved by the superintendent for forward spreading aggregate operations a failsafe device shall be installed on the plant to prevent the discharge of aggregate while the plant is moving in a reverse direction .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads iii combination or mixed plant operations where a combination of forward and reverse spreading or discharge plant or devices are used on the same section of road a prorata rate will be used to determine any additional payment e.g .
if one forward spreading vehicle and two reverse spreading vehicles are being used on the same section of road the additional payment shall be paid on one third of the total square metres sealed for that part of the contract provided that the forward spreading aggregate plant has undertaken a commensurate amount of aggregate spreading for the works .
the term commensurate implies that an equal or equivalent amount of operational time has been spent by the forward spreading aggregate plant contributing to the sealing operations but not necessarily the equivalent sealing area .
the term commensurate does not imply having the forward spreading aggregate plant on the site in either stand by or broken down mode .
for the contractor to be eligible for the incentive payments all items of plant contributing to the forward spreading aggregate sealing operations must be approved by the superintendent and operating .
in regard to the use of combination of forward and reverse spreading techniques on the same section of road there may be instances where for example the main runs of the sealing works are undertaken by forward aggregate spreading techniques and the wings a significantly small proportion of the works are undertaken by reverse spreading techniques .
in this case the actual area of the works sealed by each technique should be used for payment purposes .
iv multiple aggregate application seals for sprayed seals consisting of multiple application of aggregates incentive payments shall only be applicable to the area of the completed seal treatment i.e .
the application of a size num multiple coat seal shall only receive incentive payments for the application of the initial size num seal even if the second coat size num seal is undertaken on a subsequent day .
v multiple year contracts for multiple year contracts the additional payments shall only be applicable to the years as specified in clause numf regardless of when the contract was awarded .
num removal of loose aggregate on job items where removal of loose aggregate with a suction sweeper is required it must be specified in other requirements column of table num .
use of a suction sweeper is normal practice for all urban roads with kerb and channel and roads with a sealed shoulder .
aggregate may be swept on to unsealed shoulders using a rotary road broom where there is an unsealed shoulder but for job items where this is undesirable the use of a suction sweeper should be specified .
care needs to be taken to ensure that loose aggregate is not swept onto grass verges or areas that are mowed as it can become dangerous projectiles when ejected from mowers .
alternatively a contract specific clause can be used to specify circumstances where a suction sweeper is required if there are likely to be a large number of sites where this will be required .
it is also important to ensure that non trafficked areas are swept particularly in urban areas as loose stone can accumulate on traffic islands medians driveways pram ramps and footpaths which also need to be swept often by hand .
responsibility for removal of loose aggregate applies to the whole of the defects liability period and the contractor may be required to take action within num hours of notification to remove measurable loose aggregate arising for example from aggregate stripping .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads num acceptance of work a change has been made from earlier versions of section num to introduce a maximum texture depth as well as the minimum texture depths previously specified .
minimum texture depth requirements are included in the specification to meet vicroads policy for skid resistance and refer to potential loss of skid resistance through flushing and bleeding .
maximum texture depth is used as an indicator of inadequate binder application rate and potential for stripping or reduced service life from the seal .
texture depth of primerseals should be assessed after a period of trafficking num to num weeks to take into account the influence of aggregate embedment into the underlying pavement .
num records the contractor is required to prepare a job completion report for all work including pretreatments refer attachment a of section num .
if more information is required a contract specific clause should be inserted requiring additional information .
num defects liability period vicroads policy now requires a defects liability period of num years for sprayed sealing works .
num schedule of details table num schedule of details table num of the specification is a schedule of details for all sealing jobs under the contract .
it is important that all the details in this table are filled out correctly as the information forms the basis of tendering by defining the full extent of the work required .
for large contracts this can be a lengthy task and sufficient time must be allowed for completing this schedule before the planned date of advertising .
due to the amount of detail to be inserted into this table it is recommended that the table be prepared as an anum sized excel spread sheet in landscape mode when preparing tender documents .
the notes beneath table num of the specification provide summary information .
additional guidance for filling in this table is provided below .
job item no .
job item nos .
are also listed in schedule num of tender documents .
for large contracts it may be advantageous to have job items in groups based on the municipal area or road classification e.g .
m a b and c arterial roads .
in such cases the job items will require another number e.g .
item nos num num num etc .
as one group and item nos .
num num num etc .
as another group etc ..
the various job item elements such as the left lane right lane shoulder etc .
with different traffic volumes andor treatment types can be numbered num num num etc and num num num etc .
road name it is important to insert the declared name of the road rather than the local road or street name .
the first named town of the declared name is usually the start of the road or where the kilometre markers start .
for example on the birchiprainbow road the road kilometres would start from birchip and increase in the rainbow direction .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads map reference all vicroads declared arterial roads have a road reference number which can be obtained from the vicroads country directory or schedule b of the vicroads road management plan table num .
listing this number will ensure that correct road is located because the declared name may not be well known in the local area and road name signs may only display the local road name .
a further road descriptor required to be used is the linking victoria classification of m a b and c road classifications .
these classifications are shown in the current edition of vicroads country roads directory and on most road direction signs .
current vicroads maps of the declared road network also show these classifications .
maps can be obtained from the vicroads bookshop .
the map reference defines the approximate location of the job and assists greatly in job location .
the vicroads country directory map references are preferred but melway street directory map references may be used in the melbourne and geelong metropolitan areas provided that it is made clear that the reference applies to the melway street directory .
alternatively maps num to num of the vicroads country directory could be used for the metropolitan areas of melbourne and geelong .
chainage the chainage specifies the exact limits of work to the nearest num km which will not always be the actual length to be treated .
in some cases the overall job limits may be broken up into several lengths within the job limits having exactly the same treatment in all respects e.g .
an initial treatment final seal on a shoulder that is broken up by lengths of existing sealed left turn lanes and side roads .
approximate length this is the measured length of each element of the job regardless of width .
tapered areas are measured to half the length of the taper if the width is to be specified as a constant width see below .
approximate width this is the average width measured in at least three locations or at each change in width .
on most jobs the width of each element varies slightly and it is important that the average width is determined and specified .
if the width varies by more than num m the letter v should be inserted after the figure to indicate a variable width .
this particularly applies to small irregular shaped areas such as intersection splays chevrons and bus bays etc .
for irregular shaped areas it may also be useful to include a sketched drawing .
approximate area an electronic spread sheet program is a convenient way to record field measurements and automatically calculate areas .
in such cases the area is determined from the length by width or average width .
irregular shaped areas are manually determined and the area only is inserted length and width columns may be left blank .
tenderers use the calculated area for determination of the lump sum price for each item so it is important that the area is determined to an accuracy of num .
if the area varies by more than num a variation to the lump sum for the item is applicable refer measurement and payment section of the shell document .
on more complex jobs such as intersections it is common practice to produce a sketch to assist with calculation and checking of areas .
treatment type prime only po specified when the sealing contractor is only required to apply a prime to a pavement or bridge deck and the remainder of the work typically asphalt surfacing is to be completed by others .
primerseal ps a temporary initial treatment that is to be followed up by a final seal at a later time .
prime and seal ps a permanent initial treatment where a primer is first applied then followed by a seal one to two weeks later .
final seal fs an initial treatment seal that is sprayed over a previously completed primerseal or asphalt patch .
reseal r maintenance retreatment over an existing sealed surface as part of a periodic maintenance program .
may num num guide notes page num of num vicroads treatment description these have been fully covered in detail in the general introductory notes and are not repeated here .
single or two application enter whether the treatment is a single application s or two double applications d of binder and aggregate .
if a singledouble treatment racking in procedure is required it must be specified in the other requirements column .
aggregate size enter the nominal size of aggregate required .
if sand is to be used enter sealing sand .
minimum aggregate class enter the class of aggregate a b or c to be used see notes to clause num .
class a is a premium quality aggregate for high traffic roads .
it should not be specified on roads were a class b or c would suffice in order to conserve the higher quality aggregates where they are most needed .
annual average daily traffic aadt the aadt is the total amount of traffic travelling along a length of road in both directions in an average num hour day .
the vicroads annual traffic statistics usually provide separate traffic counts in each direction so the aadt in each direction must be added together to determine the two way aadt for the road .
some traffic counts particularly those provided by municipalities are provided as a two way aadt .
it is important to establish whether the count is for both directions or a single direction .
if only a num hour traffic count is given the aadt can be approximated by multiplying the num hour count by a factor of num unless better information is available .
percentage of equivalent heavy vehicles the vicroads traffic statistics usually provide the number and percentage of heavy vehicles in each direction for various sections of road .
the average percentage of heavy vehicles for the road can be obtained by calculating the mean of the percentage of heavy vehicles in each direction from the vicroads traffic statistics .
the percentage of equivalent heavy vehicles ehv is determined using the procedure described in the austroads sprayed seal design method aptnum which applies an additional factor to very heavy vehicles such as bdoubles and road trains austroads class num and above .
aadtlane this is the traffic volume per traffic lane or other crosssectional elements such as turn lanes bus bays and shoulders etc that is used to determine the design rate of application for binder or primerbinder in the case of a primerseal .
the aadt for each traffic lane is determined as half the two way aadt for the section of road apportioned between each of the traffic lanes .
