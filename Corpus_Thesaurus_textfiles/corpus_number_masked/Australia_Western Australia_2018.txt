the expected mean number of plant stems will vary by project area and according to seeding rate and the species used .
the sample figures provided in section num for annexure numc are nominal for urban or agricultural regions .
the figures nominated for a project must be estimated to match the plant and seed list and the density of vegetation cover that naturally occurs in the project area .
in arid areas where rainfall variability is high the spacing between individual plants will tend to be greater with more areas of bare soil than occurs in the agricultural regions with regular seasonal rainfall and low rainfall variability .

timing of works the timing of the works is fundamental to its effectiveness .
revegetationlandscaping should occur at the optimal time for the region when the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment and as soon as practical after soil preparation .
generally this is limited to match the seasonal rains otherwise watering must be allowed for .
it is important that the superintendent ensure the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment before allowing seeding operations to start .
timing of the work including the ordering and acquisition of materials is dependent on seasonal conditions and the progress of road construction works .
project timetables often mean that a delay occurs between the end of road works and the optimal time to start the revegetationlandscaping works .
where a delay is necessary the hold over period must be planned and budgeted for prior to finalising the contract .
tasks like weed control stabilisation of batters plant and seed supply may be necessary during the hold over period .

steep batter slopes project manager must ensure that the design of batters is suitable for the proposed revegetation measures .
key locations for attention are steep batter slopes where subsoil rock and groundwater may cause instability of topsoil and vegetation .
additional work in finishing of batters may be required to facilitate revegetationlandscaping works .
the risk of erosion is directly proportional to the length of time a disturbed soil area is exposed without vegetation cover or other surface protection .
consideration shall be given to the need for batter protection and weed control during any interim period until the main revegetation work can be undertaken .
main roads western australia specification num revegetation landscaping page num of num contract xxxxx document num issue num the installation of temporary and or permanent control measures e.g .
erosion control matting hydro mulching may be required to control site surface runoff or wind erosion and minimise disturbance to areas of revegetation .
steep and long slopes increase surface runoff and downslope transport of surface soil .
surface roughening and benching of bare soil by creating furrows across slopes terracing or by surface roughing tracking the soil surface reduces erosion potential by decreasing runoff velocities trapping sediment and increasing infiltration of water into the soil and will facilitate effective mulching seeding and planting .
on accessible slopes mulch shall be anchored or tracked with suitable equipment to anchor the mulch into the soil .
on slopes that are inaccessible a suitable binding agent shall be applied in accordance with the manufacturers instructions to anchor the mulch .
if nominated for use as a binding agent bitumen emulsion shall be applied at a controlled rate nominal num to num litres per square metre of surface to match the soil moisture and site requirements .
if available brush rough cut site vegetation may be laid along the slope to provide a uniform cover thatch over the soil surface .
the brush shall be secured by mulch control netting wire strands running across the slope and secured to regular fixed stakes or equal method to prevent the brush from blowing away .
num .
planting and seeding it is important to allow leadtime for securing plants and any collection of seed or plant propagation .
at least one year is recommended before the required works are due to begin .
the propagation of plants and seed collection may be contracted out separately from the revegetation and landscaping works .
the pretreatment of seeds is necessary to improve germination and to assist to break dormancy .
the requirements for pretreatment should be nominated in annexure numb .
if not nominated the contractor shall be required to treat all species of seed with pre treatment as per best horticultural practices .
in addition to smoke water hard seeded species shall be treated by scarification or hot water treatment .
a seeding rate should be specified within the design documentation .
in the absence of this information a default value of num kgha can be used .
hydromulch unless specified otherwise in annexure numb the hydromulch shall consist of water cellulose fibre mulch tacifier e.g .
gluonnum applied at numltr to numltr ha polygonnum a powder applied at numkgha or equal and other materials paper mache or bulking agent as necessary to suit the size and location of the site area the slope and soil and local weather conditions .
unless specified otherwise in annexure numb the hydromulch shall be applied at a nominal rate of numlitresha .
rates can vary from up to num litresha in response to project site conditions .
soil conditions means that the application may involve several passes e.g .
on clay soils on sand batters .

the number of applications may vary due to the conditions .
num .
weed control include any weed control requirements as part of annexure numb .
the control or removal of unwanted vegetation weed species is critical to ensure that planting and seeding operations are effective .
while eradication of all weed species may not be possible the objective is to control and reduce weed populations and to prevent their spread within the road reserve .
to make best use of available resources a listing of the weed species that pose the greatest risk should be identified and the weed control initiatives to target these priority species .
a weed control program must be developed for the contract area and implemented by the contractor .
nominated weed species should not be limited to the species identified in the design process .
the recommended approach is to require the contractor to identify all weed species within the contract area and to prepare a weed control program and submit this to the superintendent for approval prior to undertaking any works .
num .
pesticides and herbicides the term pesticide as defined by the department of health doh includes herbicides fungicides and all other specific forms of pest control agents .
herbicides are used to control or remove the growth of unwanted vegetation .
also refer to the draft main roads environmental guideline on water protection .
approval to apply pesticides on road verges in proclaimed areas must be obtained from the doe .
in water catchment areas managed by the water corporation mixing or spraying of pesticide must not occur within numm of other water courses where water is flowing .
within numm of any visible natural or artificial pool or storage .
if rain is falling or is likely to occur within four hours following application .
when herbicides are to be used in water catchment areas the doe or water corporation should be advised at least num weeks before the spraying programme .
details supplied should include location type of herbicide rate of application and date when work is planned .
advice on appropriate herbicide use within the project area selective and or non selective residual timing etc .
should be sought from specialist in the area .
a weed control plan should be prepared for the project area .
residual herbicides are generally not recommended for use within the road reserve .
a sample general list of herbicides that may be nominated for a specific project is provided below a glyphosate biactive at manufacturers recommended rate non selective .
b lontrel for broadleaf weeds at manufacturers recommended rate .
c verdict or fusilade for narrow leaf grasses at manufacturers recommended rate .

doubledouble emulsion seals using nummm and nummm sized aggregates should be applied using a num emulsion crsnum .
crsnum num bitumen content bitumen emulsion is far more liquid and less viscous than the num emulsion and will flow on the road at emulsion application rates in excess of num lmnum .
this makes it problematic for spraying the first coat of a nummm emulsion seal when binder run off will occur .
the num emulsion allows an emulsion application rate of up to about num lmnum before run off may occur .
the direct application of crsnum on to a basecourse without a prime is not recommended as the increased viscosity of the num emulsion can impair the coating ability on the surface potentially leaving pinholes that facilitate moisture ingress into the basecourse .

num .
use of a material transfer vehicle num the requirement to use a mtv has to be specified at annexure numc .
mtvs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the mtv to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor .
removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stopstart of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload .
the outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt .
mtvs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below .
where a mtv must be used includes on a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt eg .

num for a stress alleviating membrane interlayer sami seal the nominal size of aggregate shall be nummm .
specification num polymer modified bituminous surfacing num issued num document no dxxxxxx page num of num contract no xxxxx contract name num for an enhanced aggregate retention seal the nominal size is that which would have been used for a seal using class num bitumen .
num for a double double seal the stone size in the second coat is of the order of about half the size of the stone in the first coat where the larger sized stone is applied first .
typical applications are nummm which can be nummm if nummm aggregate supply is difficult however the control of spreading the nummm stone has to be managed .
a nummm double double seal is not recommended unless experienced main roads supervision is on site .
larger combinations of nummm nummm or nummm would be used as an extreme treatment to regain surface texture .
the nummm sized aggregate is difficult to procure and a contractor needs a good lead time to procure the stone .
an option is for a region to get its materials manager to liaise with quarries on availability .
the use of nummm sized aggregate should not happen without discussion with the materials engineering branch first as this is a very large sized stone that will result in a hungry surface texture which will be uncomfortable for some road users .
neither nummm or nummm aggregate is to be used for single coat seals as the stones will become large missiles if dislodged by high speed traffic .

rolling num steel wheeled rollers there is no reference to the use of steel wheel rollers in the standard specification .
the use of steel rollers on sealreseal works is not recommended particularly on softer aggregates such as granite due to the possibility of overrolling and crushing the aggregate .
num roller size table num requires that the size of rollers be specified by deleting one of two rows showing roller size .
for sprayed seals that will remain as so for their service life it is important to achieve the best embedment and alignment of the sealing aggregate at the time of application .
for seals or reseals with a service life to be beyond num years heavier rollers with a minimum mass of num tonnes must be used .
for seals that may not be trafficked such as sami seals under asphalt or bridge deck waterproofing membranes to be covered with asphalt smaller sized roller s of at least num tonne mass are acceptable .

use of a material transfer vehicle num the requirement to use a mtv has to be specified at annexure numb .
mtvs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the mtv to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor .
removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stopstart of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload .
the outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt .
mtvs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below .
where a mtv must be used includes on a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt eg .
widening of tonkin and leach highways near perth airport gateway wa project where there are long paving runs e.g .
kwinana fwy widening roe to armadale and armadale to russell where improved ride quality is required e.g .
great eastern hwy from graham farmer fwy to tonkin hwy city east alliance where asphalt is to be placed in adverse weather conditions such as low temperatures or strong winds e.g .
winter paving when paving thin layers of asphalt containing a polymer modified binder .
mtvs may not be suited for the following scenarios on a project where there will be small daily production outputs of asphalt e.g .
small minor improvement works where there are confined spaces small areas of widening such as intersection channelisation including short turn pockets .

traffic signs are intended to communicate information to the road user in a clear and concise manner .
num .
this can only be accomplished if the surface of the sign is free of damage abrasion dirt oil or other markings causing loss of legibility .
these problems are especially severe when dealing with reflective material since nighttime legibility is directly related to the quality and clarity of the reflective surface .
num .
this guide serves to highlight the important aspects of correct reflective sign storage and handling and is designed to be used by sign manufacturers sign users and erectors .
num .
all finished signs should be handled transported and stored to prevent damage to the sign face or other components .
signs should be stored vertically with their edges clear of the ground and in such a manner that the sign faces are not scuffed or marked making use of protruding stiffening members where possible .
num .
back to back storage of signs is permitted but pressure must not be transferred onto a sign face by any other sign or sign support .
specification num signs num issued num document no dxxxxxx page num of num contract no xxxxx contract name num .
when transporting signs by truck or trailer it is imperative that signs be securely braced vertically and adequately supported and secured to avoid damage due to scuffing abrasion and load shifting .
num .
large guide and information signs should be braced using wooden stiffeners attached to the extensions at the back of the sign and transported with the stiffeners in place to avoid buckling and rivet popping .
num indoor storage num .
signs should be preferably stored indoors .
signs required to be stored outdoors must have the packaging removed and be stored so as to permit free air circulation and normal moisture evaporation .
moisture must be prevented from remaining in contact with the face of the sign at all times .
packaging that has become wet or damp must be removed immediately and the signs permitted to dry completely .
steps need to be taken to ensure that high temperature and high humidity conditions do not occur in either indoor or outdoor storage .
num outdoor storage num .
signs stored outdoors shall be unwrapped from their transport packaging and stored upright on edge using wooden battens on the floor or as vertical supports or both .
num .
signs stored outdoors especially large guide or information signs should be stored using a racking system that will provide vertical support for the stored signs that will avoid pressure points on sign faces and allow adequate air circulation between sign faces to prevent a buildup of moisture .
num sign covering num .
covering signs is not good general practice due to the damage that can be caused to the sign face through the interaction of environmental conditions .
num .
if it is necessary to cover a sign face temporarily after erection caution must be exercised as some coverings may cause permanent damage to the sign face following exposure to moisture and sunlight .
some porous materials have been used successfully for limited periods by folding the material over the sign and securing it at the back of the sign .
at the same time the material needs to have sufficient opacity to prevent the reflective face of the sign showing through at night .
num .
covering signs with paper or plastic materials especially black is forbidden as it is known that these materials are responsible for severe and permanent damage within num hours as a consequence of the high temperatures and humidity conditions that can be generated during entrapment .
num .
avoid the use of ropes wire fasteners or strapping that may abrade the sign surface .
do not apply tape to the sign race because sunlight will cause it to bond permanently .
masking or application tape must be removed prior to exposure to sunlight .
num .
some specially formulated low tack pressure sensitive films are available that are suitable to mask signs .
for specific details on use refer to technical literature available from the manufacturer of the retroreflective sheeting .

they are typically specified to be installed in accordance with main roads standard drawings and therefore the test level is irrelevant .
likewise for the concrete barriers the test level is set by the height and foundation type of the concrete barriers if nominated on the drawings as it should be the test level is therefore not relevant .
barriers for structures are similarly treated .
some of these details may be shown on the drawings and therefore can be removed from table numb.num .

the wa melt has to be installed on a flare and uses timber breakaway posts .
there have been issues associated with the supply of the timber posts in terms of quality and availability and the costs for the terminal has matched or exceeded the proprietary systems which use steel breakaway posts .
guidance on the use of the wa melt was amended in july num with the following statement being added the timber posts have associated supply and durability issues and the parabolic flare creates installation difficulties .
designers are advised to utilise the other approved crashworthy terminals available .
if a proprietary end treatment is to be used then the designer shall specify the test level and the type of end treatment i.e .
redirective gating if an extruder type end treatment is required e.g .
sktnum or et num plus then this should be identified in the table and any requirements such as install on a flare should be shown on the drawings or included in table numb.num or redirective nongating wire rope systems have their own end treatments which are deemed to comply with tlnum .
for wbeam barriers there are a number of acceptable end treatments that can be used .
the designer may have chosen a particular product but in many cases other products may be acceptable .
to ensure that no supplier is disadvantaged designers shall nominate in table numb.num the end treatment that has been used for the basis of the design and in table numb.num the accepted main roads configuration as well as other acceptable alternatives .
some of the proprietary end treatments have different configurations and not all of these are acceptable to main roads .

in all instances where removal or cover of existing pavement markings is required permanent removal by overlay of the road pavement is the preferred option as it provides a new surface for the new markings without compromising safety .
unless there is a concentration of pavement markings in one area i.e .
a marked pedestrian crossing it can be an expensive option however this must be assessed against the safety implications of an alternative method of removal .
other methods of removal or cover are listed in num .
when choosing an alternative method of pavement marking removal or cover the following points should be considered a is the removalcover temporary or permanent b will the chosen method achieve the desired result in both the short and long term without excessive maintenance c will the safety of road traffic be compromised i.e .
will the resultant surface still display old markings which could be misleading to traffic num .
it should be noted that the painting over of existing road markings is considered to be a very short term and temporary measure .

r. width the distance measured at right angles to the direction of travel .
num num not used product and materials num general num .
tgsis are designed to provide pedestrians with visual and sensory information .
the two types of tgsis used by main roads wa are warning indicators and directional indicators .
num .
warning indicators alert pedestrians to hazards in the continuous accessible path of travel indicating that they should stop to determine the nature of the hazard before proceeding further .
num .
directional indicators give directional orientation to blind and vision impaired people and designate the continuous accessible path of travel when other tactile or environmental cues are insufficient .
num .
the visual contrast between the walking surface and surrounding environment are critical for visionimpaired people who are using their limited residual vision for orientation distinguishing the limits of the footpath recognising hazards and gathering information .
therefore contrast is especially important in the provision of tgsis to warn users of hazards .
tgsis shall provide a high visual contrast to the adjoining walking surface .
num .
tgsis shall be installed so that there is no likelihood of the edges lifting .
for this reason main roads wa does not approve the use of surface stick on type tgsis unless additional mechanical fastenings eg .
screws are used .
num .
discrete tgsis are not to be used on main roads wa projects unless there are contract specific requirements .
num .
main roads wa does not recommend any specific tgsi for particular applications .
the contractor will need to assess which type or style of tgsi is most suitable for the particular application taking into account substrate aesthetics contrast availability consistency with the surrounding area and cost .
