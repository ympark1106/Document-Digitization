the term owned equipment as used herein applies to equipment including trucks and machinery that the contractor is required to provide for the proper execution of the original contract work as specified in section numc whether such equipment is actually owned by the contractor is leased rented or has been obtained in some other manner .
for any owned equipment used in the performance of force account work a rental rate will be determined using data obtained from the rental rate blue book aka .
equipmentwatch cost recovery which is published by equipmentwatch a division of penton inc. blue book published data considered current as of the first day that work is performed on a specific force account is the data that will remain applicable throughout the performance of such work even if blue book data for an applicable piece of owned equipment is updated during that time .
outdated blue book data will be voided by the department annually as of a specific date and no longer accepted thereafter .
the department utilizes the engineering and construction management system ecms to keep electronic records of force account work .
to enable the department to electronically account for owned equipment utilized by contractors and subcontractors in the performance of force account work within ecms the following actions must be taken purchase a subscription to all necessary volumes of the blue book in electronic format based on the various ages of the pieces in the contractors equipment inventory for department projects utilize the all saved models tool available to subscribers to create a department project equipment inventory from the equipment included in the all saved models inventory create an equipment group use the group manager tool to select the applicable equipment group and generate a basic fleet report i.e .
the report that lists the id subtype manufacturer model year serial number and configuration as applicable for each piece of equipment in the group using the available csv button export the basic fleet report to a spreadsheet and save the spreadsheet in a .csv comma separated values file format .
note do not use the available pdf button to export the basic fleet report as ecms will not allow a spreadsheet saved in .pdf format to be imported .
at this point if the contractor or subcontractors owned equipment inventory includes any pieces that are not listed in the blue book such equipment must be added to the spreadsheet .
when adding equipment with no blue book listing to the spreadsheet care should be taken to ensure that applicable information relating to id subtype manufacturer model year serial number and configuration as it is entered is consistent with the existing column headings .
log in to ecms and import the .csv file using the import equipment hyperlink found on the contractor portal screen .
at a minimum the equipment group imported to ecms must include all of the owned equipment that will be used to perform the authorized force account work on a given project .
however to avoid having to repeat the above import procedure for future force account work on the same project or for force account work on other projects the contractor may elect to import a spreadsheet file that lists all of the equipment assigned to a given project or its entire department project owned equipment inventory .
the ecms equipment group import procedure may be repeated at any time e.g .
to import new pieces added to the inventory or to import a piece that was missed in a prior import .
an hourly rental rate for owned equipment will be computed by dividing the blue book monthly rate by num .
to this rate the blue book area adjustment percentage for pennsylvania and the age adjustment percentage for the numd numd num num change no .
num model year of the piece of equipment will be applied .
blue book citylevel regional adjustment factors will not be used in computing an hourly rental rate for owned equipment .
an allowance will be made for operating costs by adding to the above adjusted hourly rate the blue book estimated operating cost per hour for each hour that the owned equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
if a piece of owned equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis but is not operating compensation if any will be at num of the adjusted hourly rate exclusive of operating costs .
payment for standby time will not be made on any day a piece of owned equipment is operated the entire work day .

owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a numhour basis will be reimbursed at the blue book daily rate .
applicable adjustment percentages from the blue book will be applied .
where owned equipment utilized in the performance of force account work is not listed in the blue book a rental rate will be determined based on the sale price for such equipment at the time of purchase if the equipment is actually owned or the applicable lease agreement .
in these cases for equipment that is actually owned the monthly rate will be computed as num of the sale price and the total hourly rate determined by dividing the monthly rate by num when the equipment is operating and by num when the equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis but not operating with no adjustment percentages applied .
for equipment that is leased an hourly rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
additionally if not included in the lease cost an allowance will be made for operating costs by adding to the hourly rental rate the blue book estimated operating cost per hour for an equivalent piece of equipment for each hour the equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
the equivalence of the piece of equipment in the blue book listing to the piece of equipment actually used must be mutually agreed upon .
with the exception of owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic owned equipment used on a numhour basis with no listing in the blue book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate which will be computed as num of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by num with no adjustment percentages applied .
owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a numhour basis with no listing in the blue book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate which will be computed as num of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by num with no adjustment percentages applied .
if instead of being purchased the equipment was actually fabricated by the owner the sale price used to determine the daily rental rate will be the owners total documented fabrication cost .
if equipment used on a numhour basis with no listing in the blue book is leased whether or not the equipment is used for maintenance and protection of traffic the daily rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
the rates established above include the cost of fuel oil lubrication supplies necessary attachments repairs overhaul and maintenance of any kind storage all costs of moving equipment on to and away from the work site except as specified below and all incidentals .
if a piece of owned equipment not already on or near the project site is needed specifically for the force account work the cost of moving the equipment on to and away from the work site will be reimbursed provided the equipment will not be used immediately thereafter in the performance of original contract work .

section numa appendix a metric si information num a num initial edition appendix a metric si information general this appendix provides guidance on the selection of metric si units and how they relate to their counterparts in english or ip units .
topics include definitions dual units conversion rules basic units of measure commonly used si prefixes si measurements and conversion tables .
the conversion tables show multiplication values to change ip units to si units .
several additional tables in this appendix provide specific ip si relationships .
these tables include table anum .
mmnum equivalents of american wire gage table anum .
nema metric non metallic and metallic conduit and fittings table anum .
reinforcing bar information table anum .
standard test sieves u.s.a. standard sieves definitions important terms include the following si unitsunits belonging to the international system of units which is abbreviated si as interpreted or modified for use in the united states by the secretary of commerce .
english or ip unitsunits based upon the yard and the pound commonly used in the united states and defined by the national institute of standards and technology .
soft conversionan ip measurement that is mathematically converted to its exact si equivalent .
example lane width num feet ip num m si .
hard conversiona close approximation of the ip unit but is rounded logically in the si system .
example lane width num feet ip or num m si .
si base unitsthe si system consists of seven base units of measurement six of which are used in design and construction .
the seventh mole is the amount of molecular substance and is used in physics .
quantity unit symbol length mass time electric current temperature luminous intensity meter kilogram second ampere kelvin candela m kg s a k cd si derived unitsderived units are formed by combining base units supplementary units and other derived units according to the algebraic relations linking the corresponding quantities .
the symbols for derived units are obtained by means of the mathematical signs for multiplication division and use of exponents .
see the list entitled basic units of measure for examples of si derived units .
appendix a metric si information num a num initial edition dual units wherever possible measurements in these specifications are stated in dual unitssi units followed by ip units in parentheses .
dual units may be found in references to si or dual unit codes and standards e.g .
astm aashto etc ..
in other situations where references to other sources are not available logical conversion rules are applied .
many si measurements in these specifications are soft conversions of the ip measurements .
over time these si measurements will be changed through the consensus process into hard conversionsrationalized rounded si dimensions of the ip measurements .
certain situations do occur where specifications are stated in si units only or in ip units only .
these situations may occur when existing specifications have not been fully converted .
the specification was developed exclusively using ip units only or si units only .
i.e .
specified products may be available exclusively in si sizes or ip sizes .
conversion rules the metric guide for federal construction published by the national institute of building sciences provides further direction about developing specifications .
the publication presents conversion rules which aids in developing construction specifications .
the conversion rules include the following use astm e num standard practice for the use of metric si units in building design and construction as a basic reference .
follow the rules for usage conversion and rounding in ieeeastm si num standard for use of international system of units si the modern metric system annex b or ansiieee num american national standard metric practice sections num and num .
wherever possible convert measurements to rounded rationalized hard si numbers .
for instance if anchor bolts are to be imbedded to a depth of num inches the exact converted length i.e .
soft conversion of num mm might be rounded to either num mm num inches or num mm num inches .
the less critical the number the rounder it can be but ensure that allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded .
when in doubt stick with the exact soft conversion .
round to preferred si numbers i.e .
hard conversion .
while the preferred numbers for the num foot num inches system are in order of preference those divisible by num num num num num and num preferred si numbers are in order of preference those divisible by num num num and num or decimal multiples thereof .
use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert ips to si .
they are readily available and are indispensable to the conversion process .
simply check with any store or catalogue source that sells calculators or software .
be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes si numbers can be significantly larger than ip numbers a cubic meter for instance is one billion cubic millimeters .

in many applications they must be further tailored by designers and reviewers for use on specific projects .
internet access internet access to all ssps and their contents may be obtained on the ecms website .
once at the ecms homepage select construction projects then resources then special provisions .
revisions revisions will occur to the indices and their associated contents .
changes and updates to ssps may be identified by new versions example a to b or by their from dates .
as ssp entries are revised they will be retained in their original format with an appropriate notation to indicate documents that might have replaced them or their effective to dates .
thus entries will not be deleted only annotated and added .
therefore it will always be possible to determine what ssps were in effect at a certain point in time .

the apparent next lowest bidder will be notified by email to electronically submit evidence of such commitments by accessing the departments ecms website to complete and submit the dbe minority participation and commitment by num p.m. prevailing local time within five num calendar days after notification .
c good faith effort requirements .
the demonstration of gfes is accomplished by seeking out dbe participation in the project given all relevant circumstances .
the following illustrate the types of efforts that may be taken but they are not deemed to be exclusive or exhaustive for more guidance on gfe requirements refer to num cfr part num appendix c. the director andor committee will consider other factors and types of efforts that may be relevant efforts made to conduct market research to identify small business contractors and suppliers and solicit through all reasonable and available means e.g .
use of the dbe directory attendance at prebid meetings advertising andor written notices the interest of all certified dbes who have the capability to perform the work of the contract .
the bidder should provide written notification at least num calendar days before the bid opening to allow the dbes to respond to the solicitation .
the bidder must determine with certainty if the dbes are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations .
efforts made to select portions of the work to be performed by dbes in order to increase the likelihood that the dbe goal will be achieved .
this includes where appropriate breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate dbe participation even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces .
efforts made to provide interested dbes with adequate information about the plans specifications and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation .
efforts made to negotiate in good faith with interested dbes .
it is the bidders responsibility to make a portion of the work available to dbe subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available dbe subcontractors and suppliers so as to facilitate dbe participation .
evidence of such negotiation includes the names addresses and telephone numbers of dbes that were considered a description of the information provided regarding the plans and appendix c designated special provision num dspnum num cnum num change no .
num specifications for the work selected for subcontracting and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for dbes to perform the work .
a bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors including dbe subcontractors and would take a firms price and capabilities as well as contract dbe goals into consideration .
however the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using dbes is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidders failure to meet the contract dbe goal as long as such costs are reasonable .
also the ability or desire of a bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own work force does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make a gfe .
bidders are not however required to accept quotes from dbes if the price difference is too high or unreasonable .
bidders determination of a dbe as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities .
the contractors standing within its industry membership in specific groups organizations or associations and political or social affiliations for example union vs. nonunion employee status are not legitimate causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids in the contractors efforts to meet the contract dbe goal .
another practice considered an inadequate gfe is the rejection of a dbe because its quotation for the work was not the lowest received .
however nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the bidder or prime contractor to accept unreasonable quotes in order to satisfy the contract dbe goal .
efforts to assist interested dbes in obtaining bonding lines of credit or insurance .
efforts to assist interested dbes in obtaining necessary equipment supplies materials or related assistance or services .
efforts to effectively use the services of the departments dbe supportive services center services of the departments sbe supportive services center services of available minoritywomen community organizations minoritywomen contractors groups local state and federal minoritywomen business assistance offices and other organizations as allowed on a casebycase basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of dbes .

num num .
if the arrangement to be replaced is agreeable between the contractor and the dbe document the following procedures make a gfe in accordance with v.b to subcontract the work with another dbe or subcontract other work items to dbe firms to make up the dbe shortfall .
a prime contractors inability to find a replacement dbe at the contract price is not in and of itself adequate to support a finding that gfes have been made to replace the original dbe .
the fact that the prime contractor has the ability andor desire to perform the contract work with its own forces does not relieve the prime contractor of the obligation to make gfes to find a replacement dbe and it is not a sound basis for rejecting a prospective replacement dbes reasonable quote .
