standard specifications num division i general requirements and covenant definitions and terms num wording of specifications since the num edition the minnesota department of transportations standard specification for construction standard specifications has emphasized the active voice .
in division num the contractors and departments responsibilities are written in the active voiceindicative mood .
in a sentence written in the active voiceindicative mood someone acts on something .
for example the engineer will take a sample .
in divisions num and num only the departments responsibilities are written in the active voiceindicative mood .
in divisions num and num the contractors responsibilities are written in active voiceimperative mood the department states its requirements or directions for performing the work to the contractor .
the imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
such statements have the same force as if they contained the word shall and are considered mandatory .
in an imperative sentence such as pour the concrete the department is indicating that it requires the contractor to pour the concrete .
in the material specifications in division num the subject may also be the supplier fabricator or manufacturer supplying the materials products or equipment for use on the project .
