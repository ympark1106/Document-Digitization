if the results compare within the tolerances in table v section num using the individual bulk specific gravity no further testing will be required and the contractors running average of the last four bulk specific gravities will be used to compute air voids for pay factor determination .

if the engineer finds that the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the contractor he may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify .
the extended time for completion shall then be in full force and effect the same as though it were the original time for completion .
if the contractor disagrees with the decision of the engineer he may appeal directly in writing to the director .
the director shall have final authority to approve or disapprove the request for an extension of time .
the director may at his discretion refer the appeal to the claims committee for a recommendation before making his decision .
reference is made to section num claims .
time extension requests will not be referred to the claims appeal board .
b contracts on a working day basis .
when the time set for completion of the work is a number of working days extensions of contract time will be handled as outlined in subarticle a above .
section num prosecution and progress num c contracts on a calendar day or calendar date basis .
when the time set for completion of the work is a number of calendar days or a calendar date working days are not applicable .
extension of time beyond the said calendar days or date will be made as follows when the notice to proceed is delayed more than num calendar days after execution of the contract the date of completion will be extended the number of calendar days in excess of num days between the date of execution of the contract and the date of actual issuance of the notice to proceed .
where work is suspended by order of the engineer due to no fault of the contractor and time is not suspended a time extension will be granted for the number of calendar days the work is so suspended .
a time extension will be granted as provided in subarticle numb .
a time extension will be granted as outlined in the first paragraph of subarticle a above .
the following are valid reasons for time extensions when delays due to these causes are considered by the department of transportation to be beyond the control of the contractor num .
utility work being performed by others not under the contractors control that prohibit the contractors construction operations from proceeding with the normal working forces he would otherwise employ in performing the controlling item or items of work which normally would be in progress at the time said utility work is being accomplished .
num .
recovery time as defined in article num .
num .
if in the course of work material delivery time is in excess of that normally anticipated due to demands beyond the supplying industries capabilities provided such materials are necessary for the prosecution of the controlling items of work at that time and such can be substantiated by the contractor in the form of letters from suppliers the department will consider a time extension for the delay caused by the lack of available materials .
num .
if in the course of this project the contractor feels he has been unjustly penalized because of delays in departmental decisions he may submit for consideration by the engineer written specific data covering the item or items and the time element involved .
the department will consider only an extension for the actual work delay caused by the delay in obtaining a decision .
num .
if in the course of the work strikes occur while the contractor is working in good faith and such was not caused by action of the contractor the department will consider a time extension for the delay caused by the strike .
when allowing a time extension under the provisions noted in this subarticle consideration in determining the adjusted completion date for the work will be given to allow additional time to compensate for seasonal conditions weather and other factors not under control of the contractor .
should the contractor after exercising a concerted effort to diligently prosecute the work taking full advantage of every available work day not be able to complete the work within the adjusted completion time because of nonavailability of days in which work can be performed the department may consider an additional extension of time for the work .
num failure to complete work within contract time .

any adjustments due to approved time extensions or overruns in the contract amount will be made on the monthly semifinal or final estimate as may be appropriate .
liquidated damages assessed as provided in these specifications is not a penalty but is intended to compensate the state for increased time in administering the contract supervision inspection and management particularly that management and inspection which requires maintaining normal field project management forces for a longer time on any construction operation or phase than originally contemplated when the contract period was agreed upon in the contract .
permitting the contractor to continue and finish the work or any part of it after the time fixed for its completion or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended will in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the department of any of its rights under the contract .

b .
general .
when required the length of piles to be driven shall be determined by the actual loading tests of any designated pile test or production in the structure .
the test shall be performed as defined by astm d num standard test method for piles under static axial compressive load using the quick load test method .
in general these tests shall consist of the incremental application and removal of static pressure exerted on the pile through approved rigging together with suitable apparatus for accurately determining the superimposed weight mass of pressure and pile settlement under each increment of load .

ultimate capacity predictions will be based upon davissons failure criterion as applied to the aforementioned settlement curve as per fhwas manual on design and construction of driven pile foundations .
in this method the elastic shortening of the pile qlae in inches millimeters is superimposed on the settlement curve .
in the elastic shortening equation q represents load in kips kn l represents length of pile from settlement instrumentation to tip elevation in inches meters a represents cross sectional area in square inches square meters at voided section if a void is present and e represents elastic modulus in ksi mpa elastic modulus for concrete piles is preferably obtained from dynamic load testing but may be calculated as num num times the square root of the design compressive strength in psi mpa when dynamic load testing is not performed .
the elastic modulus for steel piles may always be assumed as num ksi num mpa .

the testing shall not be conducted until num hours after the placement of all concrete in a shaft and must be completed within num calendar days after placement .
the csl tests shall be conducted by an experienced independent testing consultant approved by the engineer prior to testing .
