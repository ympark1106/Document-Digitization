in the imperative mood the subject the bidder or the contractor is understood .
all other requirements to be performed by others have been written in active voice .
sentences written in active voice identify the party responsible for performing the action .
for example the engineer will determine the density of the compacted material .
certain requirements of the contractor may also be written in active voice rather than active voiceimperative mood .
sentences that define terms describe a product or desired result or describe a condition that may exist are not written in either active voice or imperative mood .
these types of sentences that describe a condition use verbs requiring no action .
for example the characteristics of the soils actually encountered in the subgrade may affect the quality of cement and depth of treatment necessary .

use class a modified concrete for the seal and in general make the thickness of the seal course num times the hydrostatic head exerting pressure on the bottom of the foundation or of a thickness as specified in the plans .
place the corners of the seal to an elevation lower than the remaining surface of the seal course for the purpose of dewatering .
in such cases do not exceed an elevation difference between the corners and the remaining surface of num inches .
c placing flowable fill .
to place flowable fill requires a minimum trench width of num inches clearance on each side of the pipe .
the engineer will allow standing water to be in the trench when backfilling with flowable fill .
deep trenches may require bleeder trenches or placement in layers to drain excess water .
because certain types of pipe may float backfill in lifts or anchor the pipe when necessary .
backfilling in lifts is more applicable to long lines of pipe allowing time for a substantial amount of the water to dissipate before applying the next lift .
the department will allow the use of adequately spaced anchors made of small lumber or metal straps to anchor the pipe .
for larger diameter pipe it may be possible to maintain a surge of flowable fill on top of the pipe to prevent floating .
floating usually does not occur after the level of the backfill is above the springline of the pipe .
ensure that the pipe remains in the correct horizontal position and elevation .
place flowable fill by discharging directly from truck chutes into the trench or place by means of conveyors buckets or pumps .
when pumping fill the voids adequately with solid particles to provide cohesion during the transport through the pump line under pressure to prevent segregation and line blockage .
maintain continuous flow through the pump line to prevent segregation and line blockage .
place the flowable fill from the top of the compacted bedding to the bottom of the pavement structure .
unless the engineer directs otherwise allow a minimum of num hours before adding and compacting any material above the flowable fill .
to expedite settling and hardening in cool weather drain or pump the bleed water from the surface or overfill the trench to allow bleed water to flow out .
when overfilling remove all excess material after hardening .
the flowable fill will bleed water within num to num minutes after placement .
the release of water by bleeding causes the solid particles to realign and become firm .
a delay in bleeding indicates there are too many fines in the mixture or insufficient water .
if the maximum water was added reduce the fly ash quantity in increments of num pounds until the mixture bleeds freely .
add approximately num pounds of sand to replace each numpound increment of fly ash to maintain the original yield .
when num increment reductions num pounds total do not promote free bleeding of the mixture evaluate other possible remedies .
the flowable fill is too dry when cracks develop as it flows into place .
d weather limitations and protection .
designate an employee for the engineer to contact in case of unexpected situations .

unless the engineer determines that safety concerns or other considerations prohibit a shutdown cease concrete production when the mixture exceeds num f until adequate methods are in place to reduce or maintain the num mixture temperature .
ensure that the temperature of the concrete mixture immediately before placing in bridges or box culverts is between num and num f. when the ambient air temperature is above num f cool the temperature of the forms reinforcing steel steel beam flanges and other surfaces that will come in contact with the mixture to below num f by means of a water spray or other approved methods .
allow excess water to drain or remove it from the forms before placing concrete .
do not place concrete in box culverts or bridges if the ambient temperature exceeds num f. maintain a minimum surface concrete temperature of num f for num calendar days after placement and at a minimum surface concrete temperature of num f for an additional num calendar days unless acceptable cylinder strength is achieved as determined by the engineer .

do not place concrete in contact with any material coated with frost or having a temperature of numf or lower .
submit a written plan detailing the methods to be used for protecting concrete for the engineers review .
when performing cold weather concrete work provide and install recording thermometers or other approved temperature measuring devices .
in cold weather heat all water andor aggregate so the temperature of the mixed concrete is no less than num f or more than num f at the time of placement .
to avoid the possibility of flash set when water or aggregate is heated to above num f mix the water and aggregate before adding the cement and do not exceed a temperature of num f for the mixture of water and aggregate when adding the cement .
when using artificial heat provide a means to maintain adequate moisture in the air within the enclosure .
maintain surfaces of all concrete in a moist condition as specified for curing during the entire curing period .
when using artificial heat do not exceed a temperature of num f for concrete near the source of heat and maintain the temperature of concrete remote from the source of heat higher than the designated num f or num f for the time of curing after placement .
when using stoves or salamanders make adequate provisions for fire protection .
assume all risk connected with placing concrete under these conditions and even with the engineers permission to do the work take responsibility for proper results .
should concrete placed under such conditions prove unsatisfactory remove and replace it with satisfactory concrete .
do not use fly ash or type nump cement in bridge decks jpc pavement jpc base or jpc shoulders between november num and march num if the item is to be opened to public traffic and exposed to deicing salts .
if the item will remain closed to public traffic until the following spring or later the department will allow the use of fly ash or type nump cement during this period .

this procedure is intended to provide for acceptance at a reduced contract price when material is discovered to not meet specification requirements after work is performed and is not intended as a means to utilize nonspecification material .
the engineer will accept fly ash on the basis of certification and being from an approved source and project samples passing the applicable requirements of astm c num andor astm c num .
