the coating process includes precleaning surface preparation coating and curing of coatings .
num definitions num good painting practice the application of generally accepted methods and equipment to clean contain and coat industrial structures in a safe practical environmentally sensitive manner resulting in a long lasting quality protective coating system .
these principals are laid out in this section .
many of the points are drawn from the sspc society for protective coatings publication steel structures painting manual volume num good painting practice .
references are to the current edition unless otherwise stated .
these practices are based on experience in the united states and where they conflict with canadian or british columbia laws regulations or guidelines the local regulations shall prevail .
num shop field and maintenance coating this consists of the series of operations that include the surface preparation pretreatment if required and application of coatings to structural steel surfaces either in the shop or in field .
it also includes the supplying of all labour equipment and materials .
in addition it encompasses the protection of newly coated surfaces during curing transport and erection as well as the protection of traffic property and the environment .
additionally it also includes the disposal of waste material in accordance with all applicable environmental fisheries and local regulations and bylaws .
num painting coating the terms painting and coating are considered synonymous for the purposes of this document .
techniques such as metallizing or galvanizing while not typically thought of as painting are considered here to be painting or coating since they form part or all of a protective system .
num shop coating shop coating is the coating of steel or other components in a shop or plant before shipment to the site of erection .
this may include part of a coating system or the whole system including the topcoat .
num field coating field coating is the coating of steel or components at the place of erection .
num maintenance coating maintenance coating is the coating of structures in service that have previously been partially or completely coated .
the maintenance coating may be one of four general types num touchup touchup is the cleaning and coating of small selected areas on a structure .
typically this is used to repair damaged or failed areas of coating .
for repairs sufficient coats are added to bring the new coating up to the level of the existing coating surrounding the repairs .
it may also be used as an interim maintenance strategy to extend the lifetime of a coating system overall .
coat zone coating is the coating process where specific whole parts of a structure are coated and others are deliberately left .
this deals with larger portions of a structure than touchup coating .
for example an above deck arch portion of a bridge would be zone coated but the edges of the flanges would be touched up .
zone coating may use touchup overcoat or recoat strategies to meet its objectives .
zone coating also includes coating new steel added to old structures for example steel added for seismic upgrades .
num overcoating overcoating is the coating of portions of a structure where the structure is touched up then coated with a topcoat overall .
it may include top coating part or all of the structure .
num recoating recoating is the coating process where larger portions of old coating on a structure are removed to bare metal and a completely new coating system is applied over the entire area .
num anchor profile the anchor profile is a measure of the roughness of the prepared surface .
the profile is normally measured from surface peak to surface valley and expressed as a range for example num to num µm or num to num mils .
besides the depth the surface profile is dependant on the grit type used to create it .
mineral abrasives such as sand slag garnet etc .
produce a sharp profile .
steel shot produces a rounded profile unless mixed with num steel grit .
normally the anchor profile is specified for both depth and sharpness .
num containment hoarding the process of encapsulating the work site so that hazardous or nuisance materials can not escape to the surrounding environment .
sspc guide num guide for containing debris generated during paint removal operations specifies types and levels of containment necessary for various cleaning operations .
num ambient conditions ambient conditions refer to such things as wind relative humidity dew point air temperature substrate temperature etc .
that affect the cleaning application and curing of coatings .
they are very important in obtaining a properly adhered long life coating .
all coating works shall be within the specified parameters as given in ss num ss num and ss num .
where ambient environmental conditions do not fall within these conditions coating work may continue if the conditions are being met within the containment .
this may mean extra hoarding dehumidification ventilation andor temperature control for the duration of cleaning application and curing of the coating system .
section num coating of steelwork num num of num num bc mot it is worthy of note that some coatings are designed to be applied in conditions outside those mentioned above .
these coatings and their conditions of use will be individually considered for use .

a best practice may evolve to become better as improvements are discovered .
best practice is considered to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that are commonly achieved in the industry .
rap sources rap may be obtained from several sources .
the common sources of rap are cold milling this is the most common source of rap .
the milling process should be closely examined to make sure that the milled material is not contaminated with soil base materials paving geotextiles or other foreign material sulphur asbestos rubber etc ..
the milled material that becomes contaminated should be stockpiled separately from rap to be used in asphalt mix .
a special milling operation may also be beneficial when it is desirable to mill the surface layer in one pass and the underlying layers in a second pass because the surface course millings may contain aggregates with higher fractured aggregates that could be incorporated in the new surface layers .
full depth pavement removal rap can also be obtained from the removal of the existing pavement using a bulldozer or a backhoe .
this process typically results in large chunks of pavement that may be contaminated with underlying soils .
this contaminated material should be stored in a separate stockpile and not to be used in the hot mix asphalt .
asphalt plant waste this includes the waste generated during plant startup transition between mixes plant clean out mix rejected from projects and excess mix produced that could not be placed .
this material usually has fewer fines than the typical rap since it wasnt milled or broken up during pavement removal and the ac is less aged than rap since it hasnt been subjected to environmental aging .
this material should be stockpiled and tested separately from the other rap .
rap contamination best practice for rap stockpiles is to keep them free from contaminants .
rap stockpiles should be treated as a valuable material .
truck drivers bringing the material on the site should ensure that unwanted debris or contaminated material does not end up in the rap stockpile .
the plant qc personnel and the loader operators should continuously monitor processed and unprocessed rap stockpiles to make sure that they do not contain deleterious materials .
if any contaminants are found they should be removed immediately so that they are not covered up with other rap brought on to the yard .
rap categories rap obtained from mot sources is referred to as classified rap .
rap obtained from non mot sources or mixed with rap from other projects is referred to as unclassified rap .
rap processing best practice for rap processing involves one or more steps to create consistent materials .
screening is used to separate sizes .
in some cases it may be desirable to screen or fractionate rap to coarse and fine fractions .
rap separation based on sizes increases quality and reduces variability in the rap properties .
for stockpiles of rap from multiple sources particularly stockpiles containing oversize fragments of rap or pavement slabs the material should be processed to produce rap with a maximum size of num mm for use in hot mix asphalt .
further processing of rap may include both screening and crushing to produce a uniform gradation ac content and other properties .
since crushing rap will create more aggregate fines it is best to set up the crushing operation so that the rap is screened before it enters the crusher .
rap processing shall occur as early as possible in the construction planning process .
rap stockpiling the best practice to minimize the accumulation of moisture in stockpiles is to cover the stockpile with a shelter tarp or building to prevent precipitation from getting to the rap .
rap stockpiles should be placed on a base with adequate drainage and constructed with minimal segregation .
arcshaped conical uniform stockpiles are preferred for storing processed or unprocessed section num use of reclaimed asphalt pavement in asphalt pavement construction appendix num rap management best practices bc mot num num num of num rap .
no contamination of the rap from the stockpile base materials should occur .
use of heavy equipment on top of the rap stockpile should be minimized to avoid compaction of the rap .
it is also recommended that the rap stockpiles be limited to num m in height to reduce the potential for self consolidation of the stockpile .
rap sampling best practice is for representative rap samples to be collected from the stockpile prepared for the project .
at least one sample per num tonnes of rap in the stockpile or a minimum of ten samples per stockpile should be taken and retained for testing .
if the asphalt mix from an existing pavement is to be used as rap num mm diameter cores should be extracted at a frequency of at least one core every num kilometer in each lane prior to the start of the project .
the asphalt mix from the pavement lift to be recycled should be tested to determine the properties of the aggregates and the asphalt cement in the pavement .
sampling method best practice for sampling aggregates applies to the sampling of rap as well .
rap stockpiles should be sampled as they are being built at the location where they will be fed into the asphalt plant .
sampling at the time the stockpile is built is the best practice and will be easier and more representative of the stockpile compared to samples taken later after the formation of the crust on the face of the rap stockpile .
proper sampling procedures normally used for virgin aggregates should also be used to sample rap aggregates as included in aashto tnum sampling of aggregates standard specifications for transportation materials and methods of sampling and testing numth edition .
minimum test frequencies the quality control tests on the rap and the extracted aggregates should be completed at the minimum frequencies specified in table numc guidelines for minimum quality control test frequencies .
all rap aggregates retained after extraction should be combined together into one sample .
the combined sample should then be sieved and split into coarse and fine fractions and used to determine the specific gravity of the recycled aggregates .
stockpile management when a stockpile reaches the desired quantity and has been sampled and characterized no additional rap material should be added to it .
subsequent rap material should be stockpiled in a separate stockpile and characterized in the same manner .
this process should continue such that characterized stockpiles are not compromised by new rap materials .
samples from the rap stockpile should be taken and the testing completed as per the minimum test frequencies specified in table numc .
