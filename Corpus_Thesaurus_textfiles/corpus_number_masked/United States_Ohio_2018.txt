these construction and material specifications are written to the bidder before award of the contract and to the contractor after award of the contract .
the sentences that direct the contractor to perform work are written as commands .
for example a requirement to provide coldweather protection would be expressed as provide coldweather protection for concrete rather than the contractor shall provide coldweather protection for concrete .
in the imperative mood the subject the bidder or the contractor is understood .
all requirements to be performed by others have been written in the active voice .
sentences written in the active voice identify the party responsible for performing the action .
for example the engineer will determine the density of the compacted material .
certain requirements of the contractor may also be written in the active voice rather than the active voice and imperative mood if the sentence includes requirements for others in addition to the contractor .
for example after the contractor provides initial written notice the engineer will revise the contract as specified in num .
sentences that define terms describe a product or desired result or describe a condition that may exist are written in indicative mood .
these types of sentences use verbs requiring no action .
for example the characteristics of the soils actually encountered in the subgrade may affect the quality of the cement and depth of treatment necessary .

remove all deficient work and replace it according to the contract documents or take such other corrective action as directed by the engineer .
the engineers authorization to substitute alternate methods and equipment will not change the basis of payment for the construction items involved or the contract time .
num determining a time extension to the completion date and payment for excusable delays .
a .
general .
the department will only extend the completion date if an excusable delay as specified in num.b or num.d delays work on the critical path shown on the accepted progress schedule and impacts the completion date .
the critical path is defined as the longest path of activities in the project that determines the project schedule completion date .
the activities that makeup the critical path of activities are the critical activities .
any extension of the completion date will be executed by a change order .
mitigation of any delay whether caused by the department contractor thirdparty or an intervening event is a shared contract and legal requirement .
mitigation efforts include but are not limited to resequencing work activities acceleration and continuation of work through an otherwise planned shutdown period .
the contractor and engineer must explore and discuss potential mitigation efforts in a timely manner .

the engineer will measure all time extensions in calendar days .
for delays measured in workdays the engineer will convert workdays to calendar days by multiplying by num for a numday work week or less num for a numday work week and num for a numday work week and extend the completion date by the resulting number of calendar days plus any holidays the contractor does not normally work that occur in the extension period .
when the conversion of workdays to calendar days results in a decimal of num or greater the engineer will round the number of calendar days to the next highest whole number .
when the conversion results in a decimal less than num the engineer will delete the decimal portion of the calendar days .
the engineer will not grant an extension of time for delays incurred from december num to april num unless the contractors accepted progress schedule depicts work on the critical path occurring during this period .
the engineer may order the contractor to continue work after november num and compensate the contractor for costs incurred due to cold weather work .
the contractors plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for an extension of time .
the department will relieve the contractor from associated liquidated damages as specified in num if the engineer extends the completion date under num.a .
the extended completion date shall then have the same standing and effect as though it was the original completion date .
if the contractor contends that an excusable delay is also compensable as specified in num.d submit a detailed cost analysis of the requested additional compensation along with the request for extension of completion date .
b. excusable noncompensable delays .

submit the dates and number of weather days in writing to the engineer at the end of each month .
in the event the contractor fails to submit weather days at the end of each month the engineer will determine the dates and number of weather days from project records .
delays caused by weather and seasonal conditions should be anticipated and will be considered as the basis for an extension of time when the contractors accepted progress schedule depicts work on the critical path and the actual workdays lost exceeds the number of work days lost each month as determined by table num .
table num month number of workdays lost due to weather january num february num march num april num may num june num july num august num september num october num november num december num this table applies to the duration between contract execution and original completion date .
extensions for weather days beyond the original completion date will be for the actual workdays lost each month .
the engineer will not consider weekends and holidays as lost workdays unless the contractor normally works those days or unless the engineer directs the contractor to work those days .
d. excusable compensable delays .
excusable compensable delays are delays that are not the contractors fault or responsibility and are the departments fault or responsibility or are determined by judicial proceeding to be the departments sole responsibility or are the fault and responsibility of a local government .

num hole excavation .
take precautions to prevent damaging existing structures and utilities .
precautions include but are not limited to selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent excessive caving of the shaft excavation and monitoring and controlling the vibrations from the driving of casing or sheeting or drilling of the shaft .
when encountered remove objects such as large boulders .
do not blast unless shown on the plans or authorized in writing by the engineer .
unless otherwise shown on the plans where drilled shafts are to be installed in conjunction with embankment placement construct shafts after the placement of the fill and completion of any specified settlement periods .
excavate for the shafts to the dimensions and elevations shown on the plans .
use methods and equipment suitable for the intended purpose and materials encountered .
use either the dry method wet method temporary casing method or permanent casing method as necessary to produce sound durable concrete foundation shafts free of defects .
when a particular method of construction is required on the plans that method shall be used .
if no particular method is specified for use select and use a method based on site conditions .
if the excavation operation is stopped protect the shaft cavity by installing a safety cover .
the contractor is responsible for the safety of the shaft excavation surrounding soil and the stability of the sidewalls .
if necessary to ensure such safety and stability use a temporary casing slurry or other methods accepted by the engineer .
unless cased to the full depth do not leave excavations unfilled overnight .
use appropriate means such as a cleanout bucket or air lift to clean the bottom of the excavation of all shafts .
promptly notify the engineer when unexpected obstructions are encountered .
a .
dry construction method .
use the dry construction method only at sites where the groundwater table and site conditions are suitable to allow construction of the shaft in a relatively dry excavation and where the sides and bottom of the shaft remain stable without any caving sloughing or swelling and may be visually inspected before placing the concrete .
the dry method consists of excavating the drilled shaft hole removing accumulated water and loose material from the excavation and placing the shaft concrete in a relatively dry excavation .
the rate of flow of water into the hole should not be more than num inches num mm within a numhour period .
do not place the initial concrete if there is more than num inches num mm of water in the bottom of the hole .
b .
wet construction method .
use the wet construction method at sites where a dry excavation can not be maintained for placement of the shaft concrete .
the wet method consists of using water or slurry to contain seepage and groundwater movement and placing concrete using a tremie or concrete pump .
additionally use this method to maintain stability of the hole perimeter while advancing the excavation to its final depth placing the reinforcing cage and placing the shaft concrete .
this method also consists of desanding and cleaning the slurry .
for drilled shafts that are not socketed into the bedrock and during drilling operations maintain a water or slurry fluid elevation inside the shaft excavation higher than the static water table .
unless demonstrated to the engineers satisfaction that the surface casing is not required provide temporary surface casings to aid shaft alignment and position and to prevent sloughing of the top of the shaft excavation .
extend surface casings from the ground surface to a point in the shaft excavation where sloughing of the surrounding soil does not occur .
c. temporary casing construction method .
use the temporary casing construction method when the stability of the excavated hole andor the effects of groundwater must be controlled .
remove temporary casings while the concrete remains workable .
as the casing is being withdrawn maintain a numfoot num m minimum head of fresh concrete in the casing so that all the fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward without contaminating the shaft concrete .
as necessary increase the required minimum concrete head to counteract groundwater head inside the casing .
extract casing at a slow uniform rate with the pull in line with the shaft axis .
rotate tap push down or vibrate the casing when necessary to extract it .
rotate the casing as little as possible to avoid deforming the reinforcing steel cage .
d. permanent casing construction method .
the permanent casing construction method generally consists of driving or drilling a casing to a specified depth before excavation begins .
if full penetration of the casing to the specified depth can not be attained the contractor may either excavate material within the embedded portion of the casing or excavate a pilot hole ahead of the casing until the casing reaches the desired penetration .
make the pilot hole no larger than onehalf the diameter of the shaft and center the hole in the shaft .
do not over ream to the outside diameter of the casing unless specifically shown on the plans .
ensure that the casing is continuous between the elevations shown on the plans .
unless otherwise shown on the plans do not use temporary casing instead of or in addition to the permanent casing .
after installing the casing and excavating the shaft place the reinforcing steel then place the shaft concrete .
after filling the permanent casing with concrete pressure grout voids between the shaft excavation and the casing with cement grout .
submit the method of pressure grouting the voids to the engineer for approval .
pressure grouting is required to ensure contact bearing between the casing and any surrounding soil layer that is used for lateral support .
num friction type drilled shafts .
friction type drilled shafts are defined as drilled shafts that do not bear on bedrock and obtain their ability to support load from a combination of end bearing on the soil and adhesion between soil and concrete along the length of the shaft .
for friction type drilled shafts dry construction method may be used for cohesive soils only .
if using a casing for the construction of a friction type drilled shaft remove the casing completely or partially as shown on the plans .
if enough water is entering the hole through the sides and bottom of the hole such that the supporting soils are being eroded maintain a positive head of fluid in the excavation hole to ensure that water is not continuously flowing into the hole .
if the engineer determines that the hole sidewall has softened due to excavation methods swelled due to delays in concreting or degraded because of slurry cake buildup over ream the sidewall to sound material .
if the concrete is not placed the same day that the excavation is completed protect the excavation with a temporary casing and redrill the hole at least num inches num mm larger in diameter clean the excavation and perform slurry test before concreting .
num casings .
use smooth watertight steel casings of sufficient strength to withstand handling and driving stresses and the concrete and surrounding earth pressures .
provide an outside diameter of the steel casing equal to or greater than the plan diameter of the shaft .
if the plan diameter of the bedrock socket is same as the drilled shaft above the bedrock and a steel casing is used provide a diameter of the bedrock socket as shown on the plans .
ensure that the diameter of the casing is large enough to allow the excavation of the bedrock socket .
where drilled shafts are located in open water areas extend the casing a minimum of num inches num mm above the water to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete .
cut off the casing at the plan top of drilled shaft elevation after the concrete has cured .
if practical install the casing in a manner that produces a positive seal at the bottom of the casing to prevent piping of water or entry of other material into the shaft excavation .
if it becomes necessary to remove a casing and substitute a longer or larger diameter casing through caving soils stabilize the excavation with slurry or backfill before installing the new casing .
the contractor may use other methods accepted by the engineer to control the stability of the excavation and to protect the integrity of the foundation soils .
num slurry .
slurry used in the drilling process shall be a mineral or polymer slurry .
the mineral slurry shall have both a mineral grain size that remains in suspension and sufficient viscosity and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to a suitable screening system .
ensure that the percentage and specific gravity of the material used to make the suspension is sufficient to maintain the stability of the excavation and to allow proper concrete placement .
maintain the level of the slurry at a height sufficient to prevent caving of the hole .
thoroughly premix the mineral slurry with clean fresh water and allow adequate time for hydration before introduction into the shaft excavation .
agitate circulate and adjust the properties of the slurry to prevent the slurry from setting up in the shaft excavation .
perform control tests using suitable apparatus on the mineral slurry to determine density viscosity and ph .
conform to the acceptable range of values for these physical properties as shown in table num .

ensure that the mineral slurry conforms to the requirements specified immediately before shaft concrete placement .
only use polymer slurry after demonstrating to the engineer that the stability of the hole perimeter can be maintained while advancing the excavation to its final depth by excavating a trial hole of the same diameter and depth as that of the production shafts .
use the same polymer slurry in the trial hole as proposed for the production shafts .
if using different sizes of the shafts at the project use the same size trial hole as that of the largest diameter shaft except the depth of the trial hole need not be more than num feet num meters .
only one trial hole per project is required .
do not use the trial hole excavation for a production shaft .
after completing the trial hole excavation fill the hole with sand .

remove drilling spoils that adhere to the vertical sides of the bedrock socket .
num reinforcing steel for drilled shafts .
place the reinforcing steel cage as a unit immediately after inspection of the excavation and before placing concrete .
if not placing the concrete immediately after installing the cage the contractor may have to remove the cage before placing the concrete to verify the integrity of the excavated area and to ensure loose material is removed from the bottom of the hole .
tie and support the reinforcing steel so it remains within the required tolerances .
securely tie spacers at quarter points around the cage perimeter and space at intervals not to exceed num feet num m along the length of the cage .
if the size of the longitudinal reinforcing steel equals or exceeds numinch num mm in diameter the contractor may increase the distance between the spacing devices to a maximum of num feet num m. use spacers of adequate dimensions to ensure a minimum annular space between outside of cage and side of hole or casing of num inches num mm for shaft diameters up to num feet num m and num inches num mm for shaft diameters larger than num feet num m. the contractor may use round plastic spacers .
maintain the top of the reinforcing steel cage no more than num inches num mm above and no more than num inches num mm below the required position .
if the reinforcing steel cage is not maintained within tolerances make acceptable corrections and do not construct additional shafts until the method of reinforcing steel cage support has been approved .
when approved by the engineer the contractor need not provide the reinforcing steel for the extended length of the drilled shaft if it is determined in the field that the contractor must drill the shaft deeper than the estimated length .
num concrete for drilled shafts .
for all drilled shafts use class qc num or qc num concrete for mass concretedrilled shaft diameter over num ft num m according to item num except as modified and supplemented as follows .

do not vibrate concrete with a vibrator .
carefully remove the casing so that the reinforcing steel cage is not deformed by the force of the downward flowing concrete .
do not place concrete in any drilled shaft excavation without acceptance from the engineer .
inspect the drilled shaft excavation immediately before placing the concrete .
provide a light powerful enough to thoroughly inspect the reinforcing steel cage the sides and the bottom of the drilled shaft .
the inspection for the wet construction method consists of only probing and measuring .
if the elevation of the top of the shaft is below ground at the time of concrete placement use a casing to prevent caving of materials into fresh concrete .
num free fall concrete placement .
the contractor may place the concrete in a dry drilled shaft excavation using the free fall method provided the concrete falls to its final position through air without striking the sides of the hole the reinforcing steel cage or any other obstruction .
use a centering drop chute at least num feet num m long with the free fall method .
unless shown on the plans there is no limit to the height of free fall .
if the concrete placement causes the shaft excavation to cave or slough or if the concrete strikes the rebar cage or sidewall reduce the height of free fall or the rate of concrete flow into the excavation or both .
if the engineer determines that dewatering is not practical or placement by free fall method can not be accomplished place the concrete using a tremie or a concrete pump .
num tremie .
the contractor may use a gravity tremie to place concrete placement instead of a concrete pump in either wet or dry holes .
for uncased wet holes maintain the drilled shaft excavation full of slurry or water to such a depth that water does not flow into the shaft excavation at any time .
to place concrete use tremies consisting of a tube of sufficient length weight and diameter to discharge concrete at the shaft base elevation .
if the tremie contains aluminum parts do not allow these parts to contact the concrete .
use tremies with an inside diameter of at least num inches num mm .
ensure that the inside and outside surfaces of the tremie are clean and smooth to allow both flow of concrete and unimpeded withdrawal during concreting .
use tremies with a wall thickness adequate to prevent crimping or sharp bends that restrict concrete placement .
for concrete placement use watertight tremies .
do not begin underwater placement until the tremie is placed to the shaft bottom elevation .
use valves bottom plates or plugs so concrete discharge can begin within one tremie diameter of the base .
either remove plugs from the excavation or use plugs of an engineer approved material that does not cause a defect in the shaft if not removed .
construct the discharge end of the tremie to allow the free radial flow of concrete during placement operations .
