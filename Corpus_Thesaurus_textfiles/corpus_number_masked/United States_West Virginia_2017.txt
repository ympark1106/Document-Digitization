west virginia department of transportation division of highways num edition standard specifications roads and bridges electronic copies of this book can be obtained via the internet at www.transportation.wv.gov take me home country roads long before there was a state of west virginia or even a colony of virginia there were roads here .
to a greater degree than in most other states particularly those with flat topography west virginias roads are organic in nature .
herds of bison had carved trails that were used by prehistoric natives from the adena and fort ancient cultures and later the different tribes that traversed the region such as the shawnee cherokee and iroquois .
in the numth century europeans arrived and began dividing up spaces that had formerly known no boundaries .
as they moved westward from the atlantic coast and into the appalachian mountains they found these bison native trails to be useful in their own migration .
many of those same trails are still used today in the form of paved highways that evolved over the centuries .
the great indian war trading path of antiquity is now u.s. route num and the famous midland trail is todays u.s. route num stretching from the states eastern border with virginia to its western border with kentucky .
where native american hunters once pursued bison for sustenance we now traverse the same roads to go to the grocery store school work and all other activities .
as the american colonies became the united states it was necessary to invest in the new nations infrastructure .
president jefferson authorized the first federal highway the national road to be built from cumberland maryland to wheeling .
not only did this highway bring new settlers to the ohio valley city but it propagated the construction of the wheeling suspension bridge in num to allow the highway to extend to st. louis .
at that time it was the longest bridge in the world and the first to extend over num feet .
still in use it is known today as the father of american bridges .
while west virginia was a part of the old dominion virginia built the northwestern turnpike now known as usnum and the stauntonparkersburg turnpike which follows present day usnumusnumwvnum .
as students of history know the western portion of the state had more than its share of gripes with the mother state especially over slavery representation taxation and overall support .
hence president lincolns creation of the state of west virginia in num allowed the people who inhabited the land from the mountains over to the ohio river to be in charge of their own destiny .
the late numth and early numth century saw west virginia and the rest of the nation begin to develop ideas and methodologies to improve our roadway systems .
however it wasnt until num with the creation of the state road commission that west virginia began road building in earnest .
americas entry into world war i and henry fords mass manufacturing of affordable automobiles ramped up the need for modern highways exponentially .
the voters of west virginia realized this need and with the passage of two good roads amendments in the nums dirt and macadam gave way to paved roads with great alacrity .
steady improvements were not always possible during the depression era as the state assumed control of all roads but generally had inadequate funds to maintain or expand the roadway system .
although with the advent of world war ii the importance of an efficient network to transport goods and services again came to the forefront .
an influx of emergency wartime funding boosted the roadbuilding efforts in west virginia and the conception of the interstate system foreshadowed the era to come .
in num the state began construction of the west virginia turnpike which would propel the economy of not just the region but provide a much needed link from midwestern markets to those in the south .
later in the nums president eisenhower authorized the interstate highway act and that vast ribbon of concrete and asphalt would eventually connect west virginia and all of the num contiguous states .
in the nums the appalachian development highway system was authorized to provide economic growth to the appalachian states including west virginia by building better traversable highways throughout the mountainous terrain .
in the decades to follow many appalachian corridors were constructed across the mountain state to provide its citizens a modern transportation system .
this network of highways is constructed through narrow stream valleys and over mountaintops producing amazing views and engineering accomplishments such as the iconic new river gorge bridge .
the nums also encompassed the tragedy of the silver bridge collapse in mason county .
however its legacy is not that of footnote wasted to history .
instead it lead to the formation of the national bridge inspection program which has served the nation hence .
throughout subsequent generations the state road commission would evolve into the division of highways and become part of the department of transportation that oversees all forms of travel in the mountain state .
through its concerted efforts west virginias interstate system was driven to completion and the appalachian corridors vastly expanded and now endure with major works continuing to this day .
thanks to the evolution of trails and paths and roads west virginia has a modern system of connectivity .
a place once known as a barrier to the nations growth has become the home of the nations numth largest roadway system .
more than num miles and over num bridges create a network that serpentines hill hollow ridge and vale .
comprised not only of major river crossings interstates and expressways but also the many small structures and rural byways woven into the landscape are of vital importance to safety commerce and quality of life of local communities throughout the state .
like the herds of bison that ran uninhibited in prehistory west virginia travelers can use these roads to celebrate our motto montani semper liberi mountaineers are always free a century of
