in a sentence written in the active voice someone acts on something .
for example the engineer will take a sample .
a similar sentence in the passive voicea sample will be takenwould be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample .
the standard speciﬁ cations also make use of the imperative mood .
the impera tive mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
in the standard speciﬁ cations the department is stating its requirements or directions for work to the contractor such statements have the same force as if they contained the word shall .
in an imperative sentence such as place the concrete the department is indicating that it requires the contrac tor to place the concrete .
before award of the contract imperative statements are directed to the bidder .
between award and execution of the contract imperatives are directed to the lowest responsible bidder and after execution to the contractor .
the department will identify parties other than the bidder or contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in the standard speciﬁ cations .
in phrasings where the respon sible party has already been clearly identiﬁ ed or in factual statements when it is not important to do so the department may use the passive voice .
when these speciﬁ cations indicate that work shall be required requested directed authorized ordered permitted suspended approved accepted or rejected it shall be understood that these expressions and others similar to them are followed by the phrase by the engineer .
num organization of the specifications a .
general .
with the exception of section num general provisions and section num materials the sections of the standard speciﬁ cations are written in a sixpart format .
each section contains the following primary subsections xxx.num description xxx.num equipment xxx.num materials xxx.num construction requirements xxx.num method of measurement xxx.num basis of payment the subsections contain varying numbers of titled subordinate subsections composed of higher and lower levels as in an outline .
b .
hierarchy of organization .
the requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections .
in addi tion many subsections begin with a lowerlevel subsection called general .
the requirements of general subsections apply to the associated samelevel num b num subsections that follow they do not apply to the higher level .
all of the provisions of section num general provisions of the standard speciﬁ cations apply to all portions of the contract .
c. titles or headings .
the titles or headings of sections and subsections are for the convenience of referencing and have no bearing on the meaning or interpretation of the text .
d. references .
the speciﬁ cations rely on many cross references both to internal sources in the speciﬁ cations and external sources in other contract documents department manuals and other industry resources .
if the contract documents reference an external publication the department intends that the reference be to the most recent issue including interim publications before the date of the advertisement unless the contract speciﬁ es otherwise .
when a test procedure uses the preﬁ x nd the proper test procedure can be found in the departments field sampling and testing manual which is avail able on the departments website www.dot.nd.gov .
each contract item listed in the contract references to a section number from the speciﬁ cations therefore all of the provisions of that referenced section that are relevant to the proper completion of the contract item are binding upon the contractor .
this includes the requirements found in the general subsections as well as those speciﬁ c requirements listed thereafter .
within the speciﬁ cations references to other sections and subsections of the speciﬁ cations apply the same as if they were a part of the speciﬁ cation section or subsection from which they were referenced .
a crossreference to a speciﬁ c subsection of these speciﬁ cations includes all general requirements of the sec tion of which the subsection is a part .

d determine whether the delay falls on the critical path .
