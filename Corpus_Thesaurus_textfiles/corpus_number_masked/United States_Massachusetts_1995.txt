this change is in response to the federal government mandate that all highway construction contracts receiving federalaid funding and advertized after september num num have plans specifications and estimates pses prepared exclusively in metric units .
therefore any project designed by any state agencyauthority andor which involves federal andor massachusetts highway department mhd funding and scheduled for advertising after september num num must be prepared in metric units .
legal basis for highway conversion the use of the metric system has been established over the past two decades by the federal government in a series of acts regulations and orders the most important of which are summarized below .
the intent of these initiatives is to have the united states adopt a measurement system that is simpler to use uses only one unit for measuring each physical quantity and provides industry the opportunity to rethink their designs and to incorporate efficient practices .
it also brings the united states into line with the rest of the world which now is virtually all metric .
metric conversion act of num the num act num u.s.c .
num declared a national policy of coordinating and encouraging the increased use of the metric system .
the act required that the conversion be led by industry and the key word was voluntary .
although conversion activities were somewhat increased there was no widespread support from industry for complete metrication .
the american association of state highway officials aashto decided at that time to defer further activity on conversion until national legislation was adopted .
omnibus trade and competitiveness act of num section numb of the trade and competitiveness act public law num amended the metric conversion act of num to declare that the metric system is the preferred system of weights and measures for u.s. trade and commerce .
further it requires each federal agency to convert to the metric system to the extent feasible by september num num for all procurements grants and businessrelated activities .
the obvious intent of this act was to use the substantial buying power of the federal government to lead the country to the metric system .
u.s .
dot metric conversion planning guidelines on may num num the u.s. department of transportation u.s .
dot issued order numc which established policy and administrative procedures for the transition .
the u.s .
dot order requires agencies to develop plans for metric conversion to the extent practical including specific dates for changeover to metric in all procurements grants and other businessrelated activities .
in response to this order the federal highway administration fhwa developed an approved conversion plan and a timetable which is intended to lead to complete metric implementation by september num num .
executive order num on july num num president bush issued executive order num metric usage in federal government programs .
the intent of this order is clear .
federal agencies are to convert to metric and they are to do so within a fixed period of time .
the num massachusetts highway department standard specifications for highways and bridges massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges ii the num massachusetts highway department standard specifications for highways and bridges has undergone an extensive review during its preparation and conversion to the metric system .
users of this document should note the following num .
metric measurements noted herein have been developed based on information available at the time this document was published and generally accepted metric conversion practices .
some measurements have been soft converted while other measurements have been hard converted .
in soft conversion an inchpound measurement is mathematically converted to its exact or nearly exact metric equivalent .
with hard conversion a new rounded rationalized metric number is created that is convenient to work with and remember .
num .
as the transition to the metric system continues in the united states it is inevitable that changes to some metric measurements noted herein will be modified particularly as more products become hard converted .
num .
in addition to the exclusive use of metric units in the num massachusetts highway department standard specifications for highways and bridges there have also been changes to various sections and new sections added that are not in the num edition of this document .
it is therefore necessary to use only the appropriate document for a particular project .

other methods of debonding strands such as greasing chemical retarders and taping alone will not be allowed .
construction methods mnum forms .
the side forms shall be of metal of approved design and construction to meet rigid conformance to line dimension design workmanship and finish .
any defects or damage of more than minor nature due to form work stripping or handling shall be cause for rejections .
forms shall be so designed that they will not restrict the longitudinal movement of the casting when the prestressing force is transferred to the casting .
tubes for forming the voids in the concrete deck beams shall be fabricated of material sufficiently strong and resistant to water to carry the wet concrete which is to be packed around the tubes without collapsing .
the tubes shall be capped at both ends to exclude concrete from entering the tubes .
the tubes shall be securely anchored so that no movement will occur during placing and consolidation of the concrete .
mnum placing tension strands .
prestressing strands shall be accurately placed in position and tensioned before the concrete is placed .
care shall be exercised to keep the strands clean of form oil and other substances harmful to the bond .
each strand shall be tensioned to the percentage of the manufacturers rated ultimate strength as specified in the aashto standard specifications for highway bridges for the type of strand used and the tension held until the concrete has attained the minimum required strength for prestressing .
the strands shall be tensioned in the casting bed by holding the tension with end anchorages until the concrete is cast and hardened and then releasing the tension gradually by an approved method .
each strand shall be finally burned or cut off at a depth of num millimeters into the end of the beam and the recessed area around the strand shall be filled with cement mortar as designated in subsection mnum .
when two or more strands are tensioned simultaneously means as approved by the engineer shall be provided to obtain equal tension in each strand as may be practicable .
jacks for tensioning shall be of approved design and shall be equipped with gauges for determining the tensioning load .
the accuracy of the gauge shall be checked when and as directed by placing a recently calibrated dynamometer in the line .
a further check of the tension shall be made by measuring the actual elongation against the elongation figured from the modulus of elasticity of the element .
suitable allowance shall be made in the tensioning for anchorage efficiency as determined by test .
iii.num massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges mnum draped pretensioned strands .
draped pretensioned strands may be tensioned partially by jacking at the end of the bed and partially by uplifting or depressing strands or they may be tensioned entirely by jacking with the strands being held in their draped positions by means of rollers or pins or other approved methods during the jacking operation .
whatever means is used low friction devices must be used at all points of change in slope of strand trajectory at the time of tensioning .
the tension for draped strands applied by jacking is done in essentially the same manner and must conform to the same requirements as the tensioning for straight strand unless otherwise noted .
if draped strands are tensioned in their draped position they should be supported by lubricated rollers with bronze bushings or roller bearings at all holdup points and low friction free turning rollers at all holddown points .
a recommended procedure for tensioning draped strands in the deflected trajectory by single strand jacking is as follows num .
applying initial tensioning load to strand .
num .
mark the strand for elongation measurement .
num .
apply the full tension load as determined by the jack gauge not by elongation .
num .
measure elongation and determine the remaining elongation required for full tension based on computed elongation .
num .
jack the strand from the other end to remaining required elongation and note the load measured by the jack gauge .
the actual gauge reading will probably be in excess of the theoretical gauge reading but should not exceed it by more than num .
single strand tensioning of strands in the draped position by jacking the strands from only one end is permissible provided the required strand elongation is obtained without the jack gauge pressures exceeding the theoretical by more than num .
when strands are deflected after partial tensioning the strands must be raised or depressed exactly the correct distances and they should be deflected simultaneously at all points or in an approved specific sequence .
disregard of these requirements could result in incorrect strand tension and put stress distribution along the strand .
the lengths of the strands to be used in calculating elongations should be the actual length of the strand along its trajectory between the fixed anchorage and the reference point at the jacking end of the strand .
it is imperative that the actual dimensions of the bed layout and locations of holdup and holddown points agree with the dimensions shown on the approved working drawings .
uplift and holddown devices must be attached in such a manner as to maintain the specified centerto center spacing of strands in both the vertical and the horizontal directions .
provisions should be made for a minimum of num millimeters of concrete cover on all metal parts of the hold down devices remaining within the beams .
use of approved fiber sleeves for the holddown bolts is satisfactory .

they shall be carefully located and securely fastened to the forms to prevent displacement .
sleeves or inserts not properly placed may be cause for rejection of the beams .
curing .
the beams shall be cured at a minimum temperature of num c and minimum humidity of num for the minimum curing period necessary to produce the minimum cylinder strength as specified on the plans transferring prestress .
a longer period of curing shall be required if curing test specimens fail to meet the minimum compressive strength .

mnum test requirements .
unless another concrete strength is specified on the plans standard comparison test specimens of concrete shall meet a minimum strength requirement of num mpa as follows concrete made with type i or ii cement num days type iii cement num days three representative test cylinders shall be made for each days pour and they shall be cured under standard job conditions aashto t num .
failure of any test specimen to meet num of minimum strength or failure of average to meet the full minimum strength requirement shall be cause for rejection of all beams poured that day .
mnum transferring tension to concrete .
in pretensioning after the concrete has developed the required strength the tension in the strands shall be transferred to the concrete gradually .
this may be done by a system of jacking or by burning or cutting the strands .
if the latter method is used the strands shall be cut by burning and the number of strands cut at a time shall be such that the stress in the remaining strands will not reach the ultimatestrength of the strands after due allowance has been made for the friction in the bed .
they shall be cut or burned between each pair of beams in the casting bed so that all of the tension in these strands is transferred to the concrete before other strands are cut or burned .
a symmetrical pattern shall be followed in releasing the tension by this method .
in order for release of the iii.num massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges strands to occur gradually they should not be quickly cut but should be heated until the metal gradually loses its strength .
draped pretensioned strands should be detensioned in accordance with the following a .
unless the total load of the precast concrete member is as much as twice the total of the forces required to hold the strands in the low position within the member or unless the members are loaded or restrained in an approved manner to resist the uplifting forces on the member at the holddown points the following sequence should be followed for detensioning num .
release the tensions in the draped strands at the ends of the members by heating each strand until it fails .
the draped strands should be heated to failure at each uplifted point in accordance with an approved sequence as shown on the working drawings .
num .
all holddown devices for the draped strands should be released and the holddown bolts within the members removed .
num .
if any straight pretensioned strands are located within the members they should be detensioned after the draped strands have been detensioned .
straight strands shall be detensioned by releasing the tension in these strands gradually and uniformly .
b .
when the total load of the precast concrete member is more than twice the total of the forces required to hold the deflected strand in the low position within the member the following sequence may be used at the fabricators option for detensioning the prestressed strands num .
holddown devices for the deflected strands may be released and the holddown bolts within the members removed .
num .
deflected strands and straight strands may be detensioned by releasing the tension in the strands gradually and uniformly .
when the total load of the member is less than twice the total of the holddown forces loads or approved vertical restraint may be applied to the member in order to counteract the uplifting forces at the holddown points when holddown devices are released .
the load or approved vertical restraint added to the member should be placed directly over the holddown points for the deflected strands .
when the total of the load of the member plus the added loads or restraint is more than twice the holddown forces the stranddetensioning method of releasing holddown devices before strand tension may be followed .
it is very important that the procedures for transfer of prestressing forces to members with deflected pretensioned strands are followed .
disregarding the procedures for transferring the forces to the members will probably result in unacceptable members .

massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num metric units terms symbols and conversion factors the basic metric system base units there are seven metric base units of measurement six of which are used commonly in design and construction .
the seventh mole is the amount of molecular substance and is used primarily in physics and chemistry .
base units quantity unit symbol length meter m mass kilogram kg time second s electric current ampere a temperature kelvin k luminous intensity candela cd derived units fifteen units with special names are derived from the base units and commonly used in engineering calculations .
derived units quantity name symbol expression frequency hertz hz hz snum force newton n n kgmsnum pressure stress pascal pa pa nmnum energy work quantity of heat joule j j nm power radiant flux watt w w js electric charge quantity coulomb w w as electric potential volt v v wa or jc capacitance farad f f cv electric resistance ohm ω ω va electric conductance siemens s s av or ω num magnetic flux weber wb wb vs magnetic flux density tesla t t wbmnum inductance henry h h wba luminous flux lumen lm lm cdsr illuminance lux lx lx lmmnum massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num decimal prefixes many numbers resulting from metric calculation using the units above are too large or small to be practically used in design and construction .
therefore three decimal prefixes are commonly used with the base units to produce a manageable number .
decimal prefixes prefix symbol order of magnitude expression mega m num num one million kilo k num num one thousand milli m num num one thousandth the prefixes giga g for one billion num micro µ for one millionth num and nano n for num are used in some engineering calculations .
the metric system includes a number of additional historically used multiples such as centi c for one hundredth num deci d for one tenth num deca da for ten num and hecto h for one hundred num but these should be avoided as much as possible .
pronunciation candela accent the second syllable candellah .
hectare accent the first syllable hecktare .
the second syllable rhymes with care .
joule rhymes with pool .
kilometer accent the first syllable killometer .
pascal rhymes with rascal .
siemens sounds like seamens .
rules for writing metric symbols names and numbers print unit symbols in upright type and in lower case except for liter l or unless the unit name is derived from a proper name such as pascal p. print unit names in lower case even those derived from a proper name .
print decimal prefixes in lower case for magnitudes num and lower i.e .
k m µ and n and print the prefixes in upper case for magnitudes num and higher e.g .
m and g. leave a space between a numeral and a symbol write num kg or num mm not numkg or nummm .
exceptions no space is left between the numerical value and the symbols for degree minute and second of plane angle e.g .
write num and not num num .
in the case of the symbol for the degree celsius this space is optional but the degree symbol must always be attached to c e.g .
write numc or num c and not num c. do not leave a space between a unit symbol and its decimal prefix write kg not k g. do not use the plural of unit symbols e.g .
write num kg not num kgs but do use the plural of written unit names e.g .. several kilograms .
for technical writing use symbols in conjunction with numerals e.g .
the area is num mnum write out unit names if massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num numerals are not used e.g .
carpet is measured in square meters .
numerals may be combined with written unit names in nontechnical writing e.g .
num meters .
indicate the product of two or more units in symbolic form by using a dot positioned above the line e.g .
kgmsnum .
do not mix names and symbols e.g .
write nm or newton meter not nmeter or newtonm .
do not use a period after a symbol e.g .
write num g not num g. except when it occurs at the end of a sentence .
always use decimals not fractions e.g .
write num g not num g. use a zero before the decimal marker for values less than one e.g .
write num g not .num g. use spaces instead of commas to separate blocks of three digits for any number over four digits e.g .
write num num kg or num num kg or num kg .
note that this does not apply to the expression of amounts of money .
in the united states the decimal marker is a period in other countries a comma usually is used .
conversion and rounding soft metric conversion soft metric means no physical change .
this means that the product in question will not be physically modified to be used in a metric project but rather a direct mathematical conversion is performed to its exact or nearly exact metric equivalent .
all that is required is that the product literature and engineering data on these products be available with metric dimensions .
it is acceptable if product literature contains both metric and english dimensions .
since product literature costs can be substantial firms without metric product literature need only develop a supplement to their existing literature .
supplements will be accepted as submittals for an interim period .
there is no problem with competitive availability of soft converted products on a metric project since these same products are competitively available today .
in the future as standard international metric product sizes are developed by iso international standard organization or another standards organization these products may undergo modification to be compatible in the world market .
hard metric conversion hard metric means product requires physical change .
the product in question must be physically modified in order to be efficiently utilized in a metric project which is planned on a metric grid .
a handful of currently used construction products must undergo hard conversion to new metric sizes .
general notes when converting numbers from inchpounds to metric round the metric value to the same number of significant digits as there were in the inchpound number e.g .
num miles at num kmmi equals num km which rounds to num km .
convert mixed inchpound units feet and inches pounds and ounces to the smaller inchpound unit before converting to metric and rounding e.g .
num feet num inches num inches num inches x num mmin num mm round to num mm .
wherever possible convert measurements to rounded rationalized hard metric numbers .
for instance if anchor bolts are to be embedded to a depth of num inches the exact converted length of num mm might be rounded to either massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num num mm num inches or num mm num inches .
the less critical the number the rounder it can be but ensure that allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded .
when in doubt stick with the exact soft conversion .
round to preferred metric numbers .
while the preferred numbers for the num foot num inches system are in order of preference those divisible by num num num num num and num preferred metric numbers are in order of preference those divisible by num num num and num or decimal multiples thereof .
use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert inchpounds to metric .
they are readily available and are indispensable to the conversion process .
be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes metric numbers can be significantly larger than inchpound numbers a cubic meter for instance is one billion cubic millimeters .
visualizing metric units a few basic comparisons are worth remembering to help visualize metric units one meter is the length of a yardstick plus about num inches .
one gram is about the mass weight of a large paper clip .
one kilogram is about the mass weight of a one liter bottle of soda about num pounds one liter is about the volume of a num inch cube num x num x num millimeters .
one liter of water has a mass of num kilogram .
one inch is just num inch longer than num millimeters num inch num millimeters num millimeters num inch .
four inches are about num inch longer than num millimeters num inches num millimeters num millimeters num inches .
one foot is about num inch longer than num millimeters num inches num millimeters num millimeters num inches .
the metric equivalent of a typical numfoot by numfoot ceiling grid is num x num mm so metric ceiling tiles and lighting fixtures are about num inch smaller in one dimension and num inch smaller in the other .
similarly the metric equivalent of a num by num sheet of plywood or drywall is num x num millimeters so metric sheets are about num inch narrower and num inches shorter .
rounding down from multiples of num inches to multiples of num mm makes dimensions exactly num percent smaller and areas about num percent smaller .
about num inch is lost in every linear foot .
one foot is about num inch longer than num millimeters num inches num millimeters num millimeters num inches .
massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num temperature comparisons num c water freezes num c cold num c comfortable room temperature num c hot num c normal body temperature num c high fever num c hot coffee num c record high temperature sahara desert num c water boils at sea level pressure massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num use of metric units in design and construction linear measurement length use only the millimeter mm meter m and kilometer km in highway design and construction .
use millimeters to represent all linear measurements less than one num meter .
use meters to represent all linear dimensions greater than one num meter .
use the kilometer for long distances and the micrometer for precision measurements .
do not use the centimeter .
for survey measurement use the meter and the kilometer .
survey stationing will be at num meter intervals .
since num the u.s. basis of length measurement has been derived from metric standards .
in num the definition of the length of the foot was changed from num to num exactly which resulted in the new value being shorter by two parts in a million .
at the same time it was decided that any data derived from and published as a result of geodetic surveys within the united states would remain with the old standard .
thus all land measurements in u.s. customary units are based upon the u.s. survey foot which related to the meter by the old standard num num num num .
mhd survey is based on the u.s. survey foot .
area the square meter mnum is preferred .
very large areas may be expressed in square kilometers kmnum and very small areas in square millimeters mmnum use the hectare ha which is equal to num num square meters for land and water measurement only .
do not use the square centimeter .
linear dimensions such as num mm x num mm may be used if so indicate width first and length second .
volume and fluid capacity cubic meter mnum is preferred for dry volumes in construction and for large storage tanks .
use liter l and milliliter ml for fluid capacity liquid volume .
plane and solid angles and slope plane angles in surveying cartography will continue to be measured in degrees either decimal degrees or degrees minutes and seconds rather than the metric radian .
the radian rad and steradian sr denote plane and solid angles .
they are used in lighting work and in various engineering calculations .
slope is expressed as a nondimensional ratio avoid the use of angles or percentages .
the vertical component is shown first and then the horizontal .
for instance a rise of one meter in four meters is expressed as num .
the units that are compared should be the same meters to meters millimeters to millimeters etc .
massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num for slopes less than num the vertical component should be unitary for example num .
for slopes over num the horizontal component should be unitary for example num time the preferred unit of time is the second s. in cases where time relates to life customs or calendar cycles the minute hour day and other calendar units may be necessary .
for example vehicle speed will normally be expressed in kilometers per hour .
temperature celsius temperature c formerly called centigrade is more commonly used than kelvin k and will be used by mhd .
both have the same temperature gradients i.e .
celsius temperature is simply num degrees warmer than kelvin which begins at absolute zero .
for instance water freezes at num k and at num c while it boils at num k and at num c. to move between celsius and kelvin add or subtract num i.e .
temperature in celsius temperature in kelvin minus num .
mass force and weight the kilogram kg is the base unit for mass which is the unit quantity of matter independent of gravity .
the metric ton t which is equal to num kg is used to denote large loads such as those used in excavating .
the newton n is the derived unit for force mass times acceleration or kgmsnum .
for calculations where the force is due to the selfweight of an object acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to num msnum .
the principal departure of the metric system from other measuring systems is the use of explicitly distinct units for mass and force .
in metric the name kilogram is restricted to the unit of mass and the kilogramforce from which the suffix force was in practice often erroneously dropped should not be used .
in its place the metric unit of force the newton is used see next page .
likewise the newton rather than the kilogramforce is used to form derived units which include force for example pressure or stress nmnum pa energy nm j and power nms w. considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass .
in commercial and everyday use the term weight nearly always means mass thus when one speaks of a persons weight the quantity referred to is mass .
this nontechnical use of the term weight in everyday life will probably persist .
in science and technology the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that if applied to the body would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall .
the use of force of gravity mass time acceleration of gravity instead of weight with this meaning is often recommended .
because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear .
when the term is used it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use metric units properly by using kilograms for mass or newtons for force .
the term load means either mass or force depending on its use .
a load that produces a vertically downward force because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units kilograms .
any other load is expressed in force units newtons .
pressure stress and elastic modulus the pascal pa is the unit for pressure and stress and is defined as pa nmmnum .
the term bar is not a metric unit and should not be used .
structural calculations should be shown in mpa or kpa .
it may be convenient to note that mpa nmmnum .
massachusetts highway department num standard specifications for highways and bridges e.num energy the joule j is the unit for energy and is defined as j nm .
the joule is used wherever energy is specified such as energy absorption in charpy vnotch tests .
do not use the joule to designate torque or bending moment always use newtonmeter nm or kilonewton meter knm .
