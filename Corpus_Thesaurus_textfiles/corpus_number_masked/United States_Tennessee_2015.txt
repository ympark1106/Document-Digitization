however the tip elevation for all piles shall be either a minimum of num feet below ground elevation or the minimum tip elevation when specified on the plans .
if the test pile has been driven to num times the specified bearing but has not reached the minimum tip elevation continue to drive the test pile until the required penetration is obtained or practical refusal occurs whichever occurs first .
when the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding num num practical pile refusal use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .

the engineer may require a test pile to be left in place for use cut off spliced or removed .

unless otherwise shown on the plans wait a minimum of num days between installing the load test pile and starting the test .

the department based the number of load tests and test piles shown on the plans on the assumption that the contractor will drive all tests piles with the same pile driver as was used for the load test pile .
if choosing to drive some test piles with a different pile driver furnish the necessary additional load tests at no additional cost to the department .
after the engineer establishes the number and length of piles to be used the contractor may drive regular piles with a different pile driver from that used for driving test piles provided it notifies the engineer of structures before pile lengths are established and uses a pile driver that conforms to the specified requirements .
num num before driving a pile to be load tested submit to the engineer written details outlining the method of applying measuring and recording test loads along with sufficient sketches to fully illustrate the method procedure and arrangements proposed .
for the jacks to be used in the tests submit to the engineer calibration certificates from a laboratory approved by the engineer .

perform the quick load test unless directed otherwise on the plans .
a .
quick load test the full test load shall be num of the pile load shown on the plans .
apply the load in approximately equal increments of num to num of the pile load as shown on the plans and at intervals of num minutes throughout the load test .
take and record readings of time load and movement immediately before and after applying each load .
apply the load until either a plunging failure occurs or the full test load is reached .
plunging failure occurs when continuous jacking is required to maintain the test load .

the failing load is defined as the minimum load that produces one of the following conditions num .
rate of settlement exceeding num inch per hour for a numhour period .
num .

num .
permanent net settlement after rebound in excess of num inch .
num num when failure occurs under condition num decrease the applied load as necessary until the rate of settlement is within the allowable limits to establish the failing load .
take a final reading num hour after complete removal of the load and accurately record the failing load .
the department will pay the full value of the unit price bid for load tests .
the engineer will decide to what extent if any the test pile will be considered as contributing to the support of the structure .
should failure not occur due to condition num carry the load test to completion with the full test load remaining on the pile for num hours and then removed in six equal increments at numhour intervals with readings taken after the removal of each increment and num hour after the complete removal of the test load .
although the terminology in this subsection is related to driven piles it shall also apply to castinplace piles if so designated on the plans .
after performing the load tests shown on the plans the contractor may choose to substitute piling of a different material or configuration from that shown on the plans provided they meet the minimum design standards and specifications and are approved by the engineer .
the required length of the substituted piling will be determined by additional load tests conducted at no cost to the department .
the basis of payment for the piling shall be in accordance with num except the total linear feet shall not exceed that established by load tests for the piles shown on the plans .
when additional test piles that are load tested and deemed usable are made at plan location using the substituted material the department will make payment at the unit bid price for regular piling .
num calibration tests when diesel or other types of hammers requiring calibration are to be used calibrate the hammers by performing load tests as directed by the engineer even if no load tests are called for in the bid schedule .
the department will not require such calibrations if the hammer is to be used only for driving piles to rock or a fixed tip elevation or when the hammer is of a type and model that has previously been calibrated by sources acceptable to the engineer for similar type size and length of pile and foundation material .
num num num order lists for piles the engineer will furnish the contractor with an itemized list showing the number and length as determined by tests of all required piles complete in place .
the engineer will not prepare the list of piling for any portion of the foundation area until the required test data representative of that portion has been determined .
the engineer will base the lengths given in the order list on the lengths that are assumed to remain in the completed structure .
furnish the piles in accordance with the itemized list except at no additional cost to the department increase the lengths to provide for fresh heading and for such additional length as may be necessary to suit the contractors method of operation .
if during pile driving the conditions encountered require a change in lengths make such changes by cutting off piling if it is too long by furnishing new piling or by splicing as specified in num if the piling is too short .
the department will make no allowance for delays caused by the procedure of determining pile lengths .
num storage and handling store and handle piles so as to avoid damaging them and as follows num .

if preformed pile holes are so oversized that the sides of a round pile or the corners of a square pile are not in contact with the soil restore lateral stability by filling the space between the pile and the sides of the hole with approved clean sand at no cost to the department .
terminate preformed holes before the required penetration is reached and drive the pile by hammer to the final tip elevation to seat the pile and secure the minimum required bearing .
except when the pile head is fitted into a steel head block provide every timber pile with a metal collar or wire wrapping .
protect the heads of all concrete piles and the heads of all other piles when the nature of the driving is such that piles may be unduly damaged with caps of approved design having a plywood cushion next to the pile head and fitting into a casting which in turn supports a hammer cushion made from durable manufactured material .
do not use wire rope and other materials of limited durability .
use an approved pile cushion of sufficient thickness to prevent damage to the pile during driving .

when the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding practical refusal use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .
if piles are raised during driving of other piles or by any other cause drive them down again at no cost to the department .
num bearing value and penetration when the bid schedule provides for load tests the engineer will determine the minimum number of hammer blows per unit of pile penetration needed to obtain the specified bearing value based on load tests performed as specified in num and num .
