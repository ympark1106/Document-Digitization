If one or more elements for a contract item show a positive P value , the positive values will be added and the resulting sum used to determine whether the lot is in conformance .
If the total P value is between 3 and 25 , the Project Manager may require correction or accept the lot at a reduced price .
If P is greater than 25 , the Project Manager may : 1 .
Require complete removal and replacement with specification material at Contractor expense ; 2 .
Require corrective action to bring the material into conformance at Contractor expense ; or 3 .
Where the finished product is found to be capable of initially performing the intended purpose but with a reduced service life expectancy , permit leaving the material in place with an appropriate price adjustment calculated using a P value ranging between 25 and 50 .
Immediately halt production following written notification when either of the following has occurred : 1 .
Three consecutive lots for a contract item have an individual total P value of 5 or more .
2 .
Beginning with the second lot , when three tests within one lot have one or more elements outside the specification bands and the total P value for the lot is 5 or more .
Make adjustments to bring the product within the specification limits before resuming production .
The Contractor does not have the option of accepting a price reduction in lieu of producing specification material .
Continued production of non-specification material is prohibited .
Material that is obviously defective may be isolated and rejected without regard to sampling sequence or location within a lot .
The Project Manager may allow the adjustments to be made without halting production .
105.03.3 Quality Incentive Allowance Quality incentive allowances will be used to offset any price reductions .
All quality incentive allowance remaining after all price reductions have been deducted will be paid as a lump sum when all work on the item is complete .
A .
Plant Mix Volumetric Properties .
Outlier determination and payment adjustments are for properties only .
If suspect test values are noted during construction , the Department will check plant production information , test equipment , processes , calculations , etc .
for 2014 EDITION CONTROL OF WORK – 105 37 errors .
If a problem is noted in the plant production , sampling or other process controlled by the Contractor , the test result will be considered valid until production is complete .
If a problem is found with the testing or other Department process , the test result will be corrected or the test redone on material from the same sample , if possible .
If a non- correctable testing problem is found , the result will be discarded , if possible another sample will be taken and the new result used in its place .
If re-sampling is not possible , the Department may discard the test results for a sub-lot considered to be an outlier and recalculate the incentives and disincentives using the remaining results in the lot .
The Department may follow standard QA guidelines to adjust lot sizes .
If no identifiable problem is found , no corrections will be made until production is complete .
The following outlier evaluation only applies to projects with 10 or more QA sub-lots .
After all production of this product is completed , the Department will determine the standard deviation and mean of all the Department ’ s test results for each property representing material produced after the initial targets were set .
For each property test , the Z value is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the test value and the mean , divided by the standard deviation .
If the average of the Z values of the four properties in a sub-lot is greater than 2.00 , the Department may consider the sub-lot an outlier .
If more than one sub-lot outlier is identified in a lot , the test results will not be considered outliers .
The Department will not adjust for outliers within the last lot of production .
The Department will discard the test results for a sub-lot considered to be an outlier and recalculate the incentives and disincentives using the remaining results in the lots .
The Department will follow standard QA guidelines to adjust lot sizes .
B. Density .
A 1.08 pay factor will be applied to the lots of plant mix surfacing when the average density for the lot ( Xn ) is from 94 % to 95 % , inclusive , of the Maximum Specific Gravity ( Rice ’ s Method ) and the range ( R ) is 3 or less .
C. Ride Specification .
The surface smoothness will be measured using the International Roughness Index ( IRI ) .
The surface smoothness will be evaluated in each travel lane for the entire length of the project .
The following project category pay factors will be applied to each lane : 105 – CONTROL OF WORK 2014 EDITION 38 TABLE 105-3 MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE VARIANCE AND DIVERGENCE Project Category Actual IRI ( Inches/mi ) Pay Factor Category I < 35 1.25 35 – 45 2.125– 25/1000 * IRI > 45 – < 55 1 55 – 75 1.825 – 3/200 * IRI > 75 – 90 0.7 > 90 Corrective Action ( Initially assumed zero pay ) Category II < 50 1.1 50 – 55 2.100 – 1/50 * IRI > 55 – < 60 1 60 – 95 1.343 – 1/175 * IRI > 95 Corrective Action ( Initially assumed zero pay ) Category III < 40 1.25 40 – 55 1.918 – 1.67/100 * IRI > 55 - < 70 1 70 – 100 1.700 – 1/100 * IRI > 100 Corrective Action ( Initially assumed zero pay ) Notes : 1 .
The pay factor is the same whether the plant mix is measured in English or metric units .
Final pay factors are rounded to 2 decimals and used in calculating the value of the incentive/disincentive .
2 .
The IRI used to calculate the Pay Factor is the average of 2 runs on each travel lane evaluated .
The incentive or disincentive for surface smoothness will be calculated based on the ride category and entire length the project in each travel lane or measured section using the following equation .
The calculated value will be applied as a line item adjustment to the plant mix item on the estimate .
Calculate the pay adjustment as follows : Pay adjustment = ( Pay Factor -1 ) x L x Unit Cost Pay Factor = Calculate using the formulas for the appropriate project category L = Length of the lane measured Unit Cost = Use appropriate value from the table below 2014 EDITION CONTROL OF WORK – 105 39 TABLE 105-4 UNIT COST Category Description Unit Cost/ft .
I or III Reconstruction or rehabilitation section with 0.3 ft. or greater plant mix surfacing $ 6.425 I , II , or III Reconstruction , rehabilitation , or overlay section with 0.2 to 0.29 ft. plant mix surfacing $ 4.283 I , II , or III 0.19 ft. or less thin lift overlay $ 3.213 Note : Isolation lifts are not considered to be part of the surfacing section when determining the appropriate overlay depth .
Incentives will be reduced based on the percentage of density tests that do not meet minimum plant mix pavement density requirements as determined by Table 105-5 Ride Incentive Reduction .
TABLE 105-5 RIDE INCENTIVE REDUCTION TABLE Project Size Percent of Density Tests not Meeting Specifications No Reduction of Ride Incentive Incentive Reduced No Incentive Allowed 0 to 25,000 Tons 0 to 10 % ( % failing tests ) * 6.667-66.67 25 % > 25,000 Tons 0 to 5 % ( % failing tests ) * 6.667-33.34 20 % Note : Final incentive reductions are rounded to 2 decimals .
Payment at the contract unit price is full compensation for all necessary resources to complete the item of work under the contract .

Adjustments will be made only when the monthly average price exceeds $ 0.25 per gallon more or less than the base price .
The adjustments will be for the amount exceeding $ 0.25 per gallon .
The price adjustment for each type of fuel will be the change in cost from the base price ( BP ) to the monthly average price ( AP ) that exceeds $ 0.25 , multiplied by the quantity ( Q ) of the item added to the progress estimate , multiplied by the fuel cost ( FC ) .
Adjustments will be according to the following formulas : Q FC BP BP AP Increase * .0 25 *       − − = Q FC BP AP BP Decrease * .0 25 *       − − = − Where : AP= Monthly Average Price BP= Base Price FC= Fuel Cost Q= Quantity Include only the cost of fuel associated with the approved items in FC .
Do not include additional costs related to items such as servicing of equipment , lubricants , tire and ground engaging component wear , depreciation , insurance , storage , licenses , inspection , etc .
Adjustments will be calculated for each type as described without regard to the grade or amount of fuel actually used .
The total of the fuel price adjustments will be added to , or subtracted from , the monthly progress estimate .

𝑃𝐹𝐺 = 1.05 The following formula will be used when any gradation test produces a failing result or an individual aggregate fraction is out of tolerance .
𝑃𝐹𝐺 = 1.0 − 0.25 ( 𝑥 ) + 2 ( 𝑦 ) 25 Where : x = The sum of percentages out of tolerance on each individual aggregate fraction ( reported to the whole number ) .
y = Percentage out of tolerance on the No .
200 ( 0.075 mm ) sieve fraction ( reported to the tenth of a percent ) .
PF = Pay Factor The following formulas are used to calculate the OLPF and unit price adjustment ADJ .
All pay factors ( PFS , PFP , PFAC , and PFG ) must be 1.00 or greater for the production lot to be eligible for positive ADJ ( incentive ) .
If any individually calculated pay factor ( PFS , PFP , PFAC , and PFG ) is less than 1.00 , the maximum value for its companion pay factor ( PFS , PFP , PFAC , and PFG ) to be used in the OLPF calculation for the respective production lot will not exceed 1.00 .
No OLPF can exceed 1.07 .
𝑂𝐿𝑃𝐹 = 𝑃𝐹𝑆 × 𝑃𝐹𝐴𝐶 × 𝑃𝐹𝑃 × 𝑃𝐹𝐺 𝐴𝐷𝐽 = ( 𝑂𝐿𝑃𝐹 − 1 ) × 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 Where ADJ = Price adjustment per pay unit to be applied to the production lot quantity Price = Contract unit price for the pay item If a pay factor is not applicable to a specific class of concrete , the pay factor ( PF ) will be 1.00 .

Protective work is that work necessary to protect unhardened concrete from damage by hail and rain .
This includes covering the concrete with a protective covering when conditions warrant .
Remedial work is that work to restore a surface profile and texture on unhardened , rain-damaged concrete .
Concrete damaged by rain to the extent the texture is obliterated and has a sandy appearance may be repaired by removing excess water and restoring it to the specified surface smoothness and texture .
Hardened concrete is concrete that is non-plastic and does not allow the vibrator to penetrate under its own weight .
Corrective work is work to provide an acceptable profile and texture on hardened , rain-damaged concrete .
Do not place fresh concrete against hardened concrete until a construction joint is placed in accordance with Subsection 552.03.6 .
Correct areas exceeding the specified surface-smoothness tolerance and areas where the specified texture can not be produced by grinding and grooving using concrete grinding machines .

When necessary , place shims in accordance with Subsection 565.03.2 .
D. Ordinary Finish .
An ordinary finish is the concrete surface left once the forms are removed and all holes caused by form ties , trapped air , and all other defects are repaired .
The finished surface must be true and even , free from stone pockets , depressions , or projections beyond the surface .
Ordinary finish is produced as follows : • Soak the concrete surface with water , and use the patching mortar specified in Subsection 552.03.10 , working it into the small air holes and other voids in the concrete face with a sponge float or wooden float .
• Rub off excess mortar after the mortar is partially set using burlap or carpet .
• Remove uneven mortar surfaces that have set too hard by rubbing the entire surface with a carborundum stone and water .
• Produce a finished surface that is uniform in texture and color .
Rub-finish all surfaces not repairable by the ordinary finish method in accordance with Subsection 552.03.11 ( E ) .
The ordinary finish may not be required for exposed vertical concrete surfaces listed below , if the forming produces a true and uniform surface and minor defects are repaired as specified : • Interior surfaces of box type concrete structures such as culverts , stockpasses , and minor grade separations ; or • Concrete diaphragms for prestress girders ; or • Pier shafts , abutment walls , columns , struts , crossbeams , or other substructure components located where they are not readily subject to public access or view .
In general , substructure elements on bridges in undeveloped rural areas and more than 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) from the edge of the public road , located in or over streams not used extensively for recreation , or exclusively over railway property are not considered subject to public access and view .
Good forming practice is considered as : • Using materials with a smooth surface free from holes , tears , dents , and gouges ; • Using the largest practical pieces to minimize joints ; • Arranging joints to be vertically or horizontally symmetrical ; and • Using bracing to prevent bulges , offsets , and other major defects in the concrete surface .
Repair major surface defects , and finish the substructure unit surface or other structural components to a uniform appearance .
Major surface defects are large rock pockets , offsets at form joints exceeding ¼-inch ( 6 mm ) , bulges , projections and depressions that deviate from the surface plane by more than ¼-inch ( 6 mm ) in any 4-foot ( 1.2 m ) length , and all other defects that reduce plan reinforcing bar cover by more than ¼-inch ( 6 mm ) .
Minor surface defects may be corrected without finishing the surrounding surface .
Remove mortar fins even with the surrounding surface .
Fill air holes exceeding ¾-inch ( 19 mm ) in the longest dimension with mortar and strike off even with the surrounding surface .
Patch minor rock pockets , tie holes , and the like as specified in Subsection 552.03.10 .
552 – CONCRETE STRUCTURES 2014 EDITION 260 E. Rubbed Finish .

Have a certified calibration chart for each jack .
Other types of jacks may be used with proving rings or other approved devices calibrated by a qualified testing laboratory .
Calibrate jacking equipment once each year and after each repair .
Re-calibration may be required if any jack or gauge gives erratic results or if the difference between the gauge reading and elongations exceed allowable limits .
Equip tensioning systems with hydraulic gauges that prevent the gauge pointer from fluctuating until the jacking load is released from the tendon .
The gauge must read loads directly in pounds ( Newtons ) or have a chart to convert the dial reading into pounds ( Newtons ) .
Ensure the gauge readings are accurate to within ± 2 % .
2014 EDITION PRESTRESSED CONCRETE MEMBERS – 553 271 Locate the gauges to provide the operator and Inspector a clear view of elongation measurements and gauge readings .
Use gauge dials graduated in increments not exceeding 100 pounds ( 700 kPa ) pressure .

553.03.7 Pretensioning Hold the prestressing elements in position using jacks when stressing .
Keep a record of the jacking force and the elongations .
Multiple units may be cast in a continuous line and stressed at one time .
Leave a space between the ends of the units to permit cutting of the strands .
Furnish strand in coils , reel-less packs , or on reels .
Stringing may be performed by pulling single or multiple strands .
Pull to gradually relieve strand rotation on coil or reel-less packs .
Strand with gripped points are not permitted within the lengths to be stressed .
Bring all prestress tendons to the uniform initial tension on the approved fabrication drawings .
Initial tension is the minimum force required to equalize stresses and eliminate slack in the strand .
Submit alternate initial loading proposals for approval .
The initial load may be applied by the jack used for single strand tensioning or by any other approved method that provides a definite , uniform load .
Regardless of the method used , measure the initial load within ± 100 pounds ( 450 N ) .
Compute elongation measurements for initial tensioning but do not use as a measurement of the initial force .
Once initial tensioning is complete , reference mark the strand as directed .
The mark must provide an accurate measurement of elongation by final tensioning .
Measure the induced stress by gauge and check it by elongation , load cell , or both .
The results must agree within 5 % .
Do not permit jacking stress to exceed 75 % of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel .
Measure the strand elongation to within 1 % of the theoretical elongation or ⅛-inch ( 3 mm ) , whichever is smaller .
If a discrepancy between measured elongations and gauge readings exceeds 5 % , check and correct the entire operation before proceeding with the work .
All uplift devices , hold-down devices , and strand openings in end bulkheads must have rounded , smooth surfaces at all contact points with the strand .
Take gauge readings , elongation measurements , and make calculations for elongation and include allowances for operational losses for the tensioning system used .
These allowances must include losses for strand slippage , anchor movement , friction , strand rotation , and other forces acting on the strand .
553 – PRESTRESSED CONCRETE MEMBERS 2014 EDITION 272 If the temperature difference between the strand at the time of tensioning and the concrete at the time of pouring exceeds 30 °F ( 16 °C ) , correct the computed elongation measurements for the temperature differences .
Provide copies of the elongation calculations to fabrication and inspection personnel at the beginning of production to ensure all allowances for the method of tensioning have been considered .
553.03.8 Final Tensioning A .
Single Strand Tensioning .
After the initial load is applied and the reference marks are established , individually pull the strands to the final load .
Tension each strand to the load required by the gauge reading .
The elongation measurement must be within ± 5 % of the load indicated by the gauge reading .
If the load indicated by gauge reading doesn ’ t agree with the measured elongation within the required tolerance , discontinue tensioning and inspect the bed for restrictions that could affect the accuracy of the applied load .
If the measurements agree , three more strands may be tensioned .
If elongation measurement and gauge readings are within the required tolerance , the remaining strands may be tensioned .
As some variation in the modulus of elasticity and the cross-sectional area of a strand does exist , the strand tensioning may be accepted , if the difference between the load determined by elongation and that indicated by the gauge does not exceed 5 % .
A maximum 10 % of the total number of straight strands for any one line of casting will be accepted on this basis .
If the difference between the elongation load and gauge readings exceed the limits , discontinue tensioning and correct the problem .
B .
Multiple Strand Tensioning .
Mark each strand , once pre-loaded and seated in the anchorage , at both end anchorages to determine elongation and slippage .
The Inspector will establish references to verify parallel movement .
Measure the stressing force by the gauge system and check it by the elongation measurement .
Use 2 load cells to verify the applied design load and check the uniformity of pull .
Place one load cell on each side of the line of pull , preferably on the outermost strands of an upper row of straight strands .
If the hydraulic gauge and the load cells agree with the elongation measurements within ± 5 % , the strands are acceptably tensioned .
If the gauge reading is within 5 % but either or both of the load cells exceed that limit , re-tension the strands including pre- loading .
Locate and place the load cells on the strands nearest to those previously gauged .
If , upon re-tensioning , the load cells are within the 5 % tolerance , no excess strand slippage has occurred , and the movable anchorage has traveled the required distance , the tensioning may be accepted .
If the difference between the gauge readings , load cell readings , and elongation measurements exceed the tolerance limit , stop tensioning and correct the problem .
Lubricate the jacking ram or rams , guide rods , and movable anchorage rails to minimize friction and run the ram through its length of travel at least four times before tensioning the strand .
C. Tensioning Draped Strands .
Draped , pre-tensioned strands may be tensioned by partial jacking at the stressing block and subsequent depressing or uplifting to the deflected position or by tensioning to the initial and final loads with the tendons held in 2014 EDITION PRESTRESSED CONCRETE MEMBERS – 553 273 the final design position using pins , rollers , or other devices .
Use low-friction devices at all points of slope change of the draped strand .
When draped strands are partially tensioned in the straight condition and then depressed to the final design position , determination of the final load is made as follows : 1 .
Before starting the tensioning operation , place a load cell at the dead end anchorage on one of the strands to be deflected in each line of beams .
2 .
The Inspector will select the strand to which the load cell will be placed .
3 .
Once tensioning is complete , the load cell reading must be within ± 6 % of the final design load .
Should the load cell reading exceed the allowable tolerance , use additional deflecting jacks to distribute friction and restraint at the deflection points or , if necessary , revise the entire method for applying the final design load within tolerances .
If the tensioning of draped strands indicates readings within the tolerances , the Inspector may require load cells for occasional checks .
If tensioning of the draped strands is performed by partial tensioning and uplift or , by tensioning in the draped position , submit the method for approval before use .
Strand splicing using approved devices is permitted .
One splice is allowed on any one strand between anchorages .
Splices must not fall within a beam .
For single strand tensioning , the number of strands spliced is not restricted .
When multiple strand tensioning is used , the number of strands spliced may not exceed 10 % of the total number of strands in the casting line , or all the strands must be spliced .
Use only one manufacturer ’ s strand in any one tensioning operation .
Use the same direction of twist of strand wires in all spliced strands .
One wire failure in 7 wire strands may remain in the casting , subject to the following : For beams with : a .
Less than 20 strands ................................... No wire breaks permitted b .
20 to 39 strands ........................................... 1 wire break permitted c. 40 to 59 strands ........................................... 2 wire breaks permitted d. 60 or more strands ...................................... 3 wire breaks permitted Should wire breaks exceed these limits , or more than one wire break in any individual strand , remove and replace that strand or strands .
Locate all wire breaks allowed to remain in the casting , and securely wrap the broken ends with tie wire to prevent unraveling .
The Fabricator may be ordered to check the prestressing steel in a tensioned member for loss of prestress before placing concrete .
The Project Manager will approve the checking method for loss of prestress .
Re-tension all strands showing a loss of prestress exceeding 3 % of the original computed jacking stress .
Except as permitted in Subsection 553.03.5 , do not weld , flame-cut , or ground welding equipment to the bed or forms after the prestress strand has been tensioned .

Pay adjustments will be applied under QA .
If test results of both the original and retained samples are not within the tolerance limits , the average of the two values will determine the basis for acceptance of the material .
Exception : If either of the two test values are outside the applicable ASTM Repeatability Range , then the test value numerically nearest the specification requirement will be used as the basis for acceptance .
In the event a material fails more than one test requirement , that requirement with the greatest violation will determine the basis for acceptance .
