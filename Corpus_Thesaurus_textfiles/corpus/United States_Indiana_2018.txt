( * * ) This is a formula , and not a multiplier .
The Fahrenheit temperature is substituted for °F in the formula to attain the Celsius temperature .
Conversion from Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperature may be made by substituting the Celsius temperature for °C in the formula ( 1.8 x °C ) +32 .
This is an exact conversion .
Angles will continue to be measured in degrees , minutes , and seconds instead of radians .
vi GENERAL NOTES 1 .
The SI unit of millimeter should be used to convert inches to millimeters .
2 .
The SI unit of Mass is the Kilogram ( Kg ) which should be used for smaller masses expressed in pounds .
The megagram ( Mg ) should be used for larger masses expressed in tons .
3 .
All units peculiar to the various cgs systems ( measurement systems constructed by using the centimeter , gram and second as base units ) are to be avoided .
4 .
In commercial and everyday use , the term weight nearly always means mass ; thus , when one speaks of a person ’ s weight , the quantity referred to is mass .
In Science and Technology , the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that , if applied to the body , would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall g ( acceleration of gravity ) .
When the term is used , it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use SI Units properly , by using Kilograms for Mass or Newtons for Force .
The use of force of gravity ( mass times acceleration of gravity ) instead of weight with this meaning is recommended .
Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity , this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear .
5 .
The term load means either mass or force , depending on its use .
A load that produces a vertically downward force because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units .
Any other load is expressed in force units .
6 .
A quantity stated as limits , such as “ not more than ” or “ maximum ” , must be handled so that the stated limit is not violated .
7 .
Conversion of quantities should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between the accuracy of the data and the given number of digits .
In all conversions , the number of significant digits retained should be such that accuracy is neither sacrificed nor exaggerated .
For example , a length of 125 ft converts exactly to 38.1 m. If however , the 125 ft length has been obtained by rounding to the nearest 5 ft , the conversion should be given as 38 m. The proper conversion procedure is to multiply a value by a conversion factor that is more accurate than is required , the result is then rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits .
8 .
For calculation of results , avoid rounding of intermediate quantities .
For reporting results , the rule for addition and subtraction is that the answer shall contain no significant digits farther to the right than occur in the least precise number .
The rule for multiplication and division is that the product or quotient vii shall contain no more significant digits than are contained in the number with the fewest significant digits used in the multiplication .
9 .
When a figure is to be rounded to fewer digits than the total number available , the standard “ 5 ” up procedures should be used as follows : ( a ) When the first digit discarded is less than 5 , the last digit retained should not be changed .
For example , 3.46325 , if rounded to three digits , would be 3.463 ; if rounded to two digits , would be 3.46 .
( b ) When the first digit discarded is 5 or greater , the last digit retained should be increased by one unit .
For example , 8.37652 , if rounded to three digits , would be 8.377 ; if rounded to two digits would be 8.38 .
10 .
Refer to ASTM SI 10 American National Standard for Use of the International System of Units ( SI ) for other conversion factors .
11 .
This specification book uses the word “ shall ” to describe the Contractor ’ s responsibilities .
The word “ will ” is used to describe the Department ’ s responsibilities .
The words “ shall ” and “ will ” are not required to be followed by the words “ by the Contractor ” or “ by the Department ” to retain these meanings .

Business 70 enterprises which are determined to be eligible will be certified as DBEs to perform specific types of work .
( c ) Goal A contract provision DBE goal may be shown on the Proposal sheet .
Such goal , if required , has been established as the desired minimum amount to be contracted to DBEs .
The Contractor shall meet or exceed the goal , or demonstrate that it could not be met despite good faith efforts .
Achievement of the goal does not relieve the Contractor of the requirement for affirmative action on subsequent subcontracting on this contract .
Only work with listed DBEs that are certified prior to the date of the 80 letting will count toward the goal .
Credit towards contract goals will be given only for work performed by certified DBEs in the work areas for which they have been certified .
The same requirements with respect to obtaining the goal apply for a Contractor that is certified as a DBE .
A DBE Contractor must either achieve the goal utilizing other DBE firms or demonstrate that the goal could not be met despite good faith efforts .
Contracting may be in the form of a subcontract , lease agreement , or material supply agreement .
Prime contractors will receive 100 % credit for work done by the DBE under subcontracts and lease agreements .
Credit for utilization of a DBE 103.01 15 90 material supplier depends on whether the supplier is a manufacturer , regular dealer or broker .
Full credit will be given for suppliers who manufacture the items and are certified as Supplier Manufacturer in the DBE repository .
Credit will be limited to 60 % of the expenditure for suppliers acting as a regular dealer and are certified as Supplier Regular Dealer in the DBE repository .
Credit will be limited to fees and commissions for suppliers acting as a broker and are certified as Supplier Broker in the DBE repository .
Suppliers shall also perform a commercially useful function in order for credit to be received .
The Contractor shall not terminate or reduce a commitment to a DBE , or an 100 approved substitute DBE firm , that was listed on the Affirmative Action Certification without the prior written consent of the Department .
This includes , but is not limited to , instances in which the Contractor seeks to perform work originally designated for a DBE subcontractor with its own forces or those of an affiliate , a non-DBE firm , or with another DBE firm .
Unless the Department provides written consent , the Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment for work or materials unless it is performed or supplied by the listed DBE .
Written consent will only be provided by the Department if the Contractor has good cause to terminate or reduce its commitment to the DBE firm .
Good cause shall 110 consist of any of the following circumstances : 1 .
The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to execute a written contract .
2 .
The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to perform the work of its subcontract in a manner consistent with normal industry standards , unless such failure or refusal of the DBE subcontractor to perform its work on the subcontract results from the bad faith or discriminatory action of the Contractor .
120 3 .
The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to meet the Contractor 's reasonable , nondiscriminatory bond requirements .
4 .
The listed DBE subcontractor becomes bankrupt , insolvent , or exhibits credit unworthiness .
5 .
The listed DBE subcontractor is ineligible to work on public works projects because of suspension and debarment proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR Parts 180 , 215 and 1200 or applicable state law .
130 6 .

140 9 .
A DBE owner dies or becomes disabled with the result that the listed DBE contractor is unable to complete its work on the contract .
10 .
Other documented good causes , that the Department will determine , which compels the termination of the DBE subcontractor .
Good cause does not exist , however , if the Contractor seeks to terminate a DBE it relied upon to obtain the contract so that it can self-perform the work for which the DBE 150 contractor was engaged or so that the Contractor can substitute another DBE or non-DBE contractor after the contract has been awarded .
Before transmitting to the Department its request to terminate or reduce a commitment made to a listed DBE , the Contractor shall give written notice to the affected DBE , with a copy to the Department , of its intent to request termination or reduction and the reasons for the request .
The DBE shall be given five days to respond to the Contractor and the Department of the reasons , if any , why it objects to 160 the proposed termination or reduction , and why the Department should not approve the Contractor ’ s action .
If required in a particular case , as a matter of public necessity and safety , the Department may specify a response period shorter than five days .
When a DBE subcontractor is terminated as specified herein or fails to complete its work on the contract for any reason , the Department will require the Contractor to make good faith efforts to find another DBE subcontractor to substitute for the original DBE .
These good faith efforts shall be directed at finding another DBE to perform at least the same amount of work under the contract as the DBE that was 170 terminated , to the extent needed to meet the contract goal the Department established for the contract .
In order to receive DBE credit for commitments made as part of the prime contract award process , a DBE firm shall be certified before the due date for bids on the prime contract .
There may be situations after the award of the prime contract in which it is appropriate to count DBE credit for the use of a DBE firm .
To be eligible to obtain DBE credit in these situations , the DBE firm shall be certified prior to participation on the contract .
103.01 17 If a non-DBE contractor joint ventures with a DBE contractor , the portion of the 180 joint venture which is performed by a DBE may be utilized to achieve the DBE goal .
Two types of DBE joint ventures are allowed and are defined as follows : 1 .
DBE Joint Venture Type A A DBE contractor and a non-DBE contractor bidding on specific pay items to be performed by each company .
2 .

Net certified scale weights or weights based on certified volumes in the case of rail shipments will be used as a basis of measurement , subject to correction when asphalt material has been lost from the car or the distributor , is wasted , or is otherwise not incorporated into the work .
190 ( e ) Measurement of PCC For design and production , PCC will be measured by the cubic yard .
The relative yield will be determined in accordance with 505.01 .
Payment for PCC will be in the unit designated for the specified use .
( f ) Measurement of Aggregates Unless otherwise provided , all aggregates for which measurements are obtained by the cubic yard will be measured at the truck loading point in truck beds that have been measured , stenciled , and approved .
They may be weighed and converted to 200 cubic yards by a conversion factor computed at sufficient intervals to ensure correct measurement .
Free water in all aggregates for which payment is made as a separate pay item on a weight basis shall be drained prior to weighing and selection of samples .
Samples for determination of moisture content shall be taken immediately prior to the time the material is to be weighed .
The number of moisture tests will be governed by moisture conditions .
Moisture contents shall be determined on the basis of oven dry weight by drying samples to constant weight at 230°F ± 9°F .
However , if ovens are not available for drying samples , other methods which give equivalent 210 results may be used .
Moisture content shall be computed to the nearest 0.5 % in accordance with the formula as follows : Percent of Moisture ( M ) = Wet weight of sample-Dry weight of sample Dry weight of sample x 100 The percent of moisture shall be noted on each weight ticket .
The wet weight will be used for the basis of payment , if the % of moisture is determined to be less than 6 % for B borrow ; 9 % of optimum moisture content , as determined in accordance with AASHTO T 99 , whichever is greater , for size No .
53 109.01 104 or No .
73 aggregates or modifications thereof when specified ; or 4 % for aggregates 220 of all other specified sizes including sand .
If the percent of moisture exceeds the limitations set out above , the weight to be paid for will be the gross weight of aggregate minus the weight of the excess moisture computed as follows : Weight to be paid for =�G x ( 100�+�m ) ( 100�+�M ) in which : G = Gross weight of material , M = Percent of moisture in the aggregate to the nearest 0.5 % based on 230 oven dry weight , m = Percent of moisture allowed in the wet aggregate to be paid for based on oven dry weight .
( g ) Measurement of Timber or Lumber Timber or lumber will be measured by the thousand feet board measure or MFBM actually incorporated into the work .
Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of each piece .
( h ) Rental of Equipment 240 Rental of equipment will be measured in hours of actual working time and necessary traveling time of the equipment within the project limits .
If special equipment has been ordered in connection with force account work , travel time and transportation costs to the project site will be recorded .
If equipment has been ordered and held on the project site on a standby basis , full time rates for such equipment will be paid .
( i ) Manufactured Materials If standard manufactured materials are specified such as fence , wire , plates , 250 rolled shapes , pipe , or conduit , and such materials are identified by gage , unit weight , or section dimensions , such identification will be considered to be nominal weights or dimensions .
Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications , manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted .
Nearly equivalent metric dimensioned manufactured items will be accepted in lieu of English dimensioned items , provided they are within the specified tolerances , when English sizes are specified .
Nearly equivalent English dimensioned manufactured items will be accepted in lieu of metric dimensioned items , provided they are within the specified tolerances , when metric sizes are specified .
109.02 Scope of Payment 260 Compensation provided for in the contract shall be received and accepted as full payment for furnishing all materials and for performing all work specified in the 109.02 105 contract in a complete and acceptable manner .
This shall also be payment in full for all risk , loss , damage , or expense of whatever character arising out of the nature of the work or the prosecution thereof , in accordance with 107.23 .
If the basis of payment clause in the specifications relating to a unit price in the Schedule of Pay Items requires that said unit price cover and be considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the pay item , this same work 270 or material will not also be measured or paid for under another pay item which may appear elsewhere in the specifications .
The term lump sum when used as a unit of payment will mean complete payment for the pay items of work described in the contract .
The payment of a current estimate before final acceptance of the work shall not affect the obligation of the Contractor to repair or renew any defective parts of the construction .
The responsibility for all damages due to such defects will be determined in accordance with 107.19 .
280 If it is agreed in writing that the quantities of certain items or portions of items of work , as set forth in the contract , are in substantial agreement with actual quantities of work performed , compensation therefore will be based on the quantities set forth in the contract without measurement thereof upon completion of the work .
Compensation based on contract quantities as agreed shall be accepted as full payment for such items or portions of items .
If the Contractor has previously agreed in writing to accept photogrammetric methods of measurement for common excavation and borrow , the Department may 290 utilize such methods of measurement as the basis of payment .
Computation of volumes shall be in accordance with 203 .
109.03 Compensation for Altered Quantities If the accepted quantities of work vary from the quantities shown in the Schedule of Pay Items , the Contractor shall accept as payment in full , so far as contract items are concerned , payment at the original contract unit prices for the accepted quantities of work done .
No allowance , except as provided in 104.02 , will be made for increased expense , loss of expected reimbursement , or loss of anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor resulting either directly 300 from such alterations or indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the contract items of overhead expense on the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement therefore , or from any other cause .
If an increase or decrease in a contract item is in accordance with 104.02 , the contract unit price will be the rate of payment unless an adjusted price is agreed to by the parties to the contract .
The contract unit price for a minor item may be adjusted if agreed to by parties for only that portion of the item which exceeds 6 % of the total 109.03 106 bid amount of the contract .
A loss or gain of overhead costs will not be a consideration for adjusting the unit prices .
310 If such alteration directly causes the loss of any work or materials already furnished under the terms of the original contract , the actual cost of such work or of salvaging such materials will be reimbursed .
All such materials may , at the option of the Department , be purchased at the actual cost including freight to the Contractor , plus 12 % .
109.04 Cost Reduction Incentive , CRI The Contractor may submit a written proposal for modifying the Contract Documents for the purpose of reducing construction costs or contract time .

In determining the estimated net savings , the contract prices bid may be disregarded if it is determined that such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be performed or deleted .
The CRI proposal will not be approved if equivalent options are already available within the contract , or if the Department is already considering a change order to the contract which includes the proposal revisions .
When a CRI proposal is received which changes superstructure type , superstructure dimensions , or superstructure dead load , the Engineer will perform a 490 109.04 110 load rating analysis on the proposed structure .
The load rating analysis must yield an inventory rating of 1.0 or greater for the design live load in order to be considered for approval .
If the inventory rating is less than 1.0 , the proposed design shall be modified so that the load rating analysis yields an inventory rating of 1.0 or greater for the design live load before the CRI proposal is considered for approval .
If the CRI proposal is approved , it will be executed by means of a change order .
The change order will show the changes in the plans and specifications necessary to enable the proposal to be put into effect and the net estimated savings will be set 500 forth on the change order .
Upon approval , the Department will have the right to use , duplicate , and disclose in whole or in part , all data necessary for the subsequent adoption of the proposal for future projects .

The Contractor will be compensated for materials ordered which are unique to the project based on the Contractor ’ s cost minus salvage value if the Contractor is unable to return these items to the vendor .
All such material may , at the option of the Department , be purchased at its actual cost .
There will be no reimbursement for costs incurred prior to the acceptance of the conceptual CRI proposal .
The Contractor will not be reimbursed for design costs if a formal CRI proposal is rejected because it was not submitted within the time frame specified in the Contractor ’ s conceptual proposal or additional time approved by the Engineer , if the Contractor fails to 530 submit additional information requested by the Department , or if the design criteria used in the proposal does not comply with the Department ’ s design standards .
( e ) Other Conditions The Contractor shall continue to perform the work in accordance with the contract requirements until a change order incorporating the CRI proposal has been 109.04 111 approved .
However , no contract work that will be affected by a CRI proposal shall be performed until the CRI proposal has been approved or rejected .
Prior to approval , the Engineer may modify a proposal with the concurrence of 540 the Contractor , to enhance it or make it acceptable .
If any modification increases or decreases the net savings resulting from the proposal , the Contractor ’ s 50 % share will be determined upon the basis of the proposal as modified .
The Department reserves the right to include in the change order the conditions it deems appropriate for consideration , approval and implementation of the CRI proposal .
Acceptance of the change order by the Contractor shall constitute acceptance of such conditions .
As a condition for considering a Contractor ’ s CRI proposal , the Department also reserves the right to require the Contractor to share in the Department ’ s costs of investigating the proposal .
If this condition is imposed , the 550 Contractor shall indicate acceptance in writing .
Such acceptance shall constitute full authority for the Department to deduct amounts for the investigation from moneys due the Contractor under the contract .
The Engineer may reject , in accordance with 105.03 and 105.11 , all or any portion of work performed under an approved CRI proposal .
( f ) Time Savings Proposals The Contractor may submit a CRI proposal that reduces contract time by changing phasing of the work , the traffic control plan , or design elements .
560 The Department will consider proposals that result in time savings and at the same time may increase the cost of the project .
The Department will be the sole judge as to whether the benefits of completing the project or a project phase before the scheduled completion date or milestone offsets an increase to the cost of the project .
The submittals for time savings will be reviewed using the CRI proposal process .
The Contractor shall provide the Department sufficient information to enable the Department to evaluate the cost benefit of the savings .
570 ( g ) Adjustments to Contract Time For approved formal CRI proposals the Department will adjust the applicable contract time as set out in the proposal .
Any adjustment will be set forth in the change order for the CRI proposal .
Depending on the Contractor ’ s proposal , the adjustment will be an increase or decrease in the appropriate completion date .
( h ) Method of Measurement The work , as revised by the formal CRI proposal , will be measured as complete and in place and in accordance with the change order .
580 109.04 112 ( i ) Basis of Payment The work , as revised by the formal CRI proposal , will be paid for as complete and in place and in accordance with the change order .
In addition , the Contractor ’ s Reasonable Design Cost and 50 % of the total net savings of the CRI proposal will be paid for separately as follows : 1 .
The Contractor ’ s Reasonable Design Cost for the CRI proposal will be paid for after approving the formal CRI proposal with the change order .
590 2 .
Upon completion of all items of work included in the change order , the total net savings will be calculated and the Contractor will be paid 50 % of the total net savings .
The total net savings resulting from the CRI will be calculated as follows : TNS = OCW – RCW – CRDC – DC where : 600 TNS = total net savings OCW = original cost of the work required by the original contract RCW = revised cost of the work CRDC = Contractor ’ s reasonable design cost for the CRI proposal 610 DC = Department ’ s cost for investigating , evaluating , and implementing the CRI proposal .
3 .
A cost savings of not less than $ 5,000.00 shall be guaranteed to the Department .
The actual formal CRI proposal net savings will be checked upon completion of the contract and determination of final quantities to determine if any payment 620 adjustment is required .
Only those work items directly affected by the plan change will be considered in making the determination of net cost savings .
Subsequent plan changes affecting the modified work items but not related to the CRI proposal will be excluded from such determination .
Upon completion of all work included in the CRI proposal , the final total net savings will be determined by comparing the cost of the work based on the 109.04 113 original contract quantities with the cost of the actual CRI proposal work performed .
In determining the savings , the Department reserves the right to consider other factors in addition to the contract bid prices and proposed unit prices if , in the 630 judgment of the Department , such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be deleted from or added to the contract .
The net savings of a CRI proposal to reduce contract time will be determined by multiplying the number of days saved by the daily liquidated damages as set forth in Section 108.08 or as otherwise provided in the contract .
Redesign engineering , in accordance with this section , is defined as 50 % of the contractor ’ s reasonable design costs incurred after the Department ’ s acceptance of the CRI proposal .
Redesign Engineering will be paid when a conceptual CRI has 640 been accepted by the Department but the final proposal is rejected .
Payment will be made under : Pay Item Pay Unit Symbol Contractor ’ s Reasonable Design Cost for CRI Proposal No .
