If a nationwide shortage exists in basic materials or standard items which are necessary in the fabrication or manufacture of equipment , parts or articles to meet the specific requirements of the project , a serious widespread shortage of such equipment , parts or articles may be considered as a valid reason for the extension of contract time .
Delivery delays or shortages caused by ordinary supply fluctuations are not nationwide shortages and therefore are not valid reasons for extension of time .
The contractor 's plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time .
If the contractor requests additional time and if the Engineer finds that the work activities controlling overall job progress and the projected completion date were delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the contractor , and could not have been anticipated by the contractor , the Engineer may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify .

2 ) Interval Programs : The following interval functions and sequence per ring shall be programmed in the pre-emptor module .
Interval 1 : The minimum guaranteed green interval .

Therefore , if the phase was in green longer than the interval programmed time prior to initiation of pre-emption , the pre-emptor will advance to interval 3 .
Interval 2 : The minimum guaranteed green-pedestrian clearance interval .
The effective start time for this interval is when the phase that is timing enters pedestrian clearance .
Therefore , if the phase was in pedestrian clearance longer then the interval programmed time prior to initiation of pre-emption , the pre-emptor will advance to interval 3 .
Interval 3 : The minimum guaranteed phase yellow clearance interval .
SECTION 734 729 The effective start time for this interval is when the phase that is timing enters yellow clearance .
Therefore , if the phase was in yellow clearance longer than the interval programmed time prior to initiation of pre-emption , the pre-emptor will advance to interval 4 .
This interval will only be in effect if pre-emption was initiated during green or yellow .
Pre-emption will terminate the green or yellow phase .
Interval 4 : The minimum guaranteed overlap yellow clearance interval .
Any overlap is assigned to one ring that is timing during entry into pre-emption .
The overlap will terminate when that ring starts interval .
The effective start time for this interval is when overlaps go into yellow clearance .
If the overlaps have been in yellow clearance longer than the interval programmed time prior to the initiation of pre-empt , the pre-emptor will advance to interval 5 .
Interval 5 : The minimum guaranteed overlap all-red clearance interval .
The effective start time for this interval is when the overlaps that are going to terminate and the phase that is timing are in red .
This interval will stay in effect until all the overlaps that are going to terminate , and the phase that is timing has been in red for the programmed all-red time .
The pre-emptor then will advance to interval 6 .
If there is no track clearance phase assigned to a ring , that ring will advance to interval 9 .
Interval 6 : The track clearance green interval .
This interval will time the assigned track clearance green programmed time , and upon completion , the ring will advance to interval 7 .
Interval 7 : The track clearance yellow interval .
This interval will time the assigned track clearance yellow programmed time .
W hen the timing is complete , the ring will advance to interval 8 .
Interval 8 : the track clearance all red interval .
This interval will time the assigned track clearance all red programmed time .
W hen the timing is complete , the ring will advance to interval 9 .
Interval 9 : The hold/lock interval .
W hen both rings of the pre-emptor sequence have reached interval 9 , the pre-emptor will be advanced to interval A. Interval A : The duration passage interval .
SECTION 734 730 This interval will time the completion of the programmed duration time .
The duration time will start timing when the pre-emption sequence is started .
Interval A will insure that the pre-emption sequence will not terminate until programmed time after initiation of pre-emption , regardless of the phases and intervals in effect during initiation of pre-emption or the timing of intervals preceding interval A .
The phase assigned for each ring shall operate as a hold phase .
The options of `` ped indications active '' and `` hold flash '' take effect during this interval .
Interval B : The hold/passage interval .
The hold time will start timing when pre-emption interval A starts .
Interval B will insure a minimum time in the passage movement before pre-emption will be permitted to terminate .
The interval will terminate only when the programmed time is complete and the pre-emption input is non-active , after which the interval will be set to C. The hold phases , `` ped indications active '' and `` hold flash '' shall be applied during interval B. Interval C : The hold/passage yellow clearance interval .
At the completion of the hold/passage interval , the hold clearance yellow will time unless : ( 1 ) There are no exit phases .
The pre-emptor will be non-active , and exit as soon as interval B is complete .
( 2 ) The pre-empt call returns active .
The pre-emptor will go back to interval B. W hen the hold/passage yellow clearance timing is complete , the interval will advance to interval D. Interval D : The hold/clearance all-red clearance interval .
If the pre-emption call returns , the pre-emptor will go back to interval B. W hen the hold/passage all red clearance timing is complete , the interval will advance to interval E. Interval E : The exit lock interval for the pre-emptor .
W hen both pre-emption rings get to interval E , the pre-emptor will exit the pre-emption sequence .
3 ) Pre-emptor Flash : SECTION 734 731 The Type MPS controller pre-emption module flash can be initiated in the following ways : ( a ) Hold Flash ( b ) Power up with pre-emption ( c ) External start with pre-emption ( d ) Sum check bad ( e ) Power up/external start with illegal phases ( f ) Illegal controller software valve .
