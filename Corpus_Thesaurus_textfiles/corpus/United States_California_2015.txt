The contractor shall carry out applicable requirements of 49 CFR part 26 in the award and administration of DOT-assisted contracts .
Failure by the contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract , which may result in the termination of this contract or such other remedy as the recipient deems appropriate , which may include , but is not limited to : ( 1 ) Withholding monthly progress payments ; SECTION 2 BIDDING 21 ( 2 ) Assessing sanctions ; ( 3 ) Liquidated damages ; and/or ( 4 ) Disqualifying the contractor from future bidding as non-responsible .
Include this assurance in each subcontract you sign with a subcontractor .
2-1.12B Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Goal 2-1.12B ( 1 ) General Section 2-1.12B applies if a DBE goal is shown on the Notice to Bidders .
The Department shows a goal for DBEs to comply with the DBE program objectives provided in 49 CFR 26.1 .
Make work available to DBEs and select work parts consistent with the available DBEs , including subcontractors , suppliers , service providers , and truckers .
Meet the DBE goal shown on the Notice to Bidders or demonstrate that you made adequate good faith efforts to meet this goal .
You are responsible to verify at bid opening the DBE firm is certified as a DBE by the California Unified Certification Program and possess the work codes applicable to the type of work the firm will perform on the Contract .
Determine that selected DBEs perform a commercially useful function for the type of work the DBE will perform on the Contract as provided in 49 CFR 26.55 ( c ) ( 1 ) – ( 4 ) .
Under 49 CFR 26.55 ( c ) ( 1 ) – ( 4 ) , the DBE must be responsible for the execution of a distinct element of work and must carry out its responsibility by actually performing , managing , and supervising the work .
All DBE participation will count toward the Department 's federally mandated statewide overall DBE goal .
Credit for materials or supplies you purchase from DBEs will be evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis and counts toward the goal in the following manner : 1 .
100 percent if the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE manufacturer .
2 .
60 percent if the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE regular dealer .
3 .
Only fees , commissions , and charges for assistance in the procurement and delivery of materials or supplies if they are obtained from a DBE that is neither a manufacturer nor a regular dealer .
49 CFR 26.55 defines manufacturer and regular dealer .
You receive credit toward the goal if you employ a DBE trucking company that is performing a commercially useful function .
The Department uses the following factors in determining whether a DBE trucking company is performing a commercially useful function : • The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract , and there can not be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals .
• The DBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed , insured , and operational truck used on the contract .
• The DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services it provides on the Contract using trucks it owns , insures , and operates using drivers it employs .
• The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm , including an owner-operator who is certified as a DBE .
The DBE who leases trucks from another DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services the lessee DBE provides on the Contract .
• The DBE may lease trucks without drivers from a non-DBE truck leasing company .
If the DBE leases trucks from a non-DBE truck leasing company and uses its own employees as drivers , it is entitled to credit for the total value of these hauling services .
• A lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use of and control over the truck .
This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease with the consent of the DBE , so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck .
Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE .
[ 49 CFR 26.55 ( d ) ] SECTION 2 BIDDING 22 2-1.12B ( 2 ) DBE Commitment Submittal Submit DBE information under section 2-1.33 .

If a DBE is participating as a joint venture partner , submit a copy of the joint venture agreement .
2-1.12B ( 3 ) DBE Good Faith Efforts Submittal You can meet the DBE requirements by either documenting commitments to DBEs to meet the Contract goal or by documenting adequate good faith efforts to meet the Contract goal .
An adequate good faith effort means that the bidder must show that it took all necessary and reasonable steps to achieve a DBE goal that , by their scope , intensity , and appropriateness to the objective , could reasonably be expected to meet the DBE goal .
If you have not met the DBE goal , complete and submit the DBE Good Faith Efforts Documentation form under section 2-1.33 showing that you made adequate good faith efforts to meet the goal .
Only good faith efforts directed toward obtaining participation by DBEs are considered .
Submit good faith efforts documentation within the specified time to protect your eligibility for award of the contract in the event the Department finds that the DBE goal has not been met .

The t-value for test data is determined using the following equation : SECTION 40 CONCRETE PAVEMENT 514 where : nc = number of your QC tests ( minimum of 6 required ) nv = number of Department ’ s tests ( minimum of 2 required ) X c = mean of your QC tests X v = mean of the Department ’ s tests Sp = pooled standard deviation Sc = standard deviation of your QC tests Sv = standard deviation of the Department ’ s tests Your QC test results are compared with the Department 's test results at a level of significance of α = 0.01 .
The t-value is compared to tcrit for the degrees of freedom shown in the following table : Degrees of freedom ( nc+nv-2 ) tcrit ( for α = 0.01 ) 1 63.657 2 9.925 3 5.841 4 4.604 5 4.032 6 3.707 7 3.499 8 3.355 9 3.250 10 3.169 If the calculated t-value is less than or equal to tcrit , your QC test results are verified .
If the calculated t- value is greater than tcrit , your QC test results are not verified .
If your QC test results are not verified , core at least 3 specimens from the concrete pavement under section 40-1.03M .
The Engineer selects the core locations .
The authorized laboratory must test these specimens for air content under ASTM C457 .
The Engineer compares these test results with your QC test results using the t-test method .
If your QC test results are verified based on this comparison , the Engineer uses the QC test results for acceptance of concrete pavement for air content .
If your QC test results are not verified based on this comparison , the Engineer uses the air content of core specimens determined by the authorized laboratory under ASTM C457 for acceptance .

The Engineer identifies the joint and dowel or tie bar to be tested .
Each dowel or tie bar test consists of 2 cores , 1 on each end of the bar to expose both ends for measurement .
If the initial cores show that dowel or tie bars are within alignment tolerances and the Engineer orders more coring , the additional cores are change order work .
If the coring indicates the dowel or tie bars are not placed within the specified tolerances or if unconsolidated concrete is around the dowel or tie bars , perform additional coring as ordered to determine the limits of unacceptable work .
The Engineer determines the limits for removal and replacement .
40-1.01D ( 8 ) ( c ) ( iii ) Pavement Smoothness The Department may accept pavement smoothness based on your inertial profiler testing in the absence of its own testing .
40-1.01D ( 8 ) ( c ) ( iv ) Thickness Drill cores for the Department 's acceptance testing for thickness under section 40-1.03M .
Drill the cores in the primary area , which is the area placed in 1 day for each thickness .
Core at the locations determined by the Engineer and in the Engineer 's presence .
If grinding is required , do not core until grinding has been completed .
The core specimen diameter must be 4 inches .
To identify the limits of concrete pavement deficient in thickness by more than 0.05 foot , you may divide primary areas into secondary areas .
The Engineer measures cores under California Test 531 to the nearest 0.01 foot .
You may request additional thickness measurements to determine the average thickness variation .
The Engineer determines the locations with random sampling methods .
If each thickness measurement in a primary area is deficient by less than 0.05 foot , the Engineer calculates the average thickness deficiency in that primary area .
The Engineer uses 0.02 foot for a thickness difference more than 0.02 foot over the specified thickness .
The thickness of the concrete pavement must not be deficient by more than 0.05 foot .
For each thickness measurement in a primary area deficient by more than 0.05 foot , the Engineer determines a secondary area where the thickness deficiency is more than 0.05 foot .
The Engineer determines this secondary area by measuring the thickness of each concrete pavement slab adjacent to the measurement found to be more than 0.05 foot deficient .
The Engineer continues to measure the thickness until an area that is bound by slabs with a thickness deficient by 0.05 foot or less is determined .
Slabs without bar reinforcement are defined by the areas bound by longitudinal and transverse joints and concrete pavement edges .
Slabs with bar reinforcement are defined by the areas bound by longitudinal joints and concrete pavement edges and 15-foot lengths .
The thickness measurements for a secondary area in a slab determine that entire slab thickness .
The Engineer measures the remaining primary area thickness after removing the secondary areas from consideration for determining the average thickness deficiency .
The minimum thickness is not reduced for specifications that may affect concrete pavement thickness such as allowable tolerances for subgrade construction .
The Engineer determines the areas of noncompliant pavement , thickness deficiencies , and limits where removal is required .
Pavement with an average thickness deficiency less than 0.01 foot is acceptable .
If the thickness deficiency is 0.01 foot or more and less than 0.05 foot , you may request authorization to leave the pavement in place and accept a payment adjustment .
If the deficiency is more than 0.05 foot , you must remove and replace the pavement .
The deduction for pavement thickness deficiency in each primary area is as shown in the following table : SECTION 40 CONCRETE PAVEMENT 517 Deduction for Thickness Deficiency Average thickness deficiencya Deduction 0.01 foot $ 0.90/sq yd 0.02 foot $ 2.30/sq yd 0.03 foot $ 4.10/sq yd 0.04 foot $ 6.40/sq yd 0.05 foot $ 9.11/sq yd aValues greater than 0.01 foot are rounded to the nearest 0.01 foot .
