A bidder may tie the acceptance or rejection of two or more proposals on the condition that either all proposals are accepted or all are rejected , in which case the bids will be rejected unless each bid is the lowest responsive bid on each project .
The Department may reject a proposal if any of the unit prices contained therein are materially unbalanced , either excessive or below the Engineer ’ s estimate .
A materially unbalanced bid generates a reasonable doubt that award to the bidder submitting a mathematically unbalanced bid will result in the lowest ultimate cost to the Department .
A mathematically unbalanced bid contains lump sum or unit bid items that do not reflect reasonable actual costs and a proportionate share of bidder ’ s anticipated profit , overhead costs , and other indirect costs .
The Department may reject any proposals as non-responsive if : 1 .
Proposals fail to contain a unit price for each item listed .
2 .
Proposals are not prepared on the prescribed forms .
3 .
Proposals show any unauthorized omissions , conditions , alterations of form , additions , or irregularities of any kind .
4 .
Proposals show unauthorized alternate bids .
In the case of authorized alternate items , a unit price on only one of the alternates will be required , unless otherwise specified in the Contract .
5 .
Proposals are not electronically signed by an authorized representative of the bidder .
The electronic signature on the electronic bidding file serves as signatures for the proposal form , proposal certification form and the proposal bond form , if applicable .
6 .
When electing to submit a Proposal Guaranty , the bidder fails to submit a signed Proposal Guaranty in the proper character and amount indicated on the proposal form .
102.10 17 7 .
The Proposal Guaranty is not properly signed by the Agent or Attorney-in-Fact representing a Surety accompanied by a dated and valid Power of Attorney for the Attorney-in-Fact .
The date on the Power of Attorney must match the date on the Proposal Guaranty .
8 .
A bidder is not prequalified and in good standing on the date of letting in accordance with 102.01 and Chapter 1680-5-3 , Prequalification of Contractors .
9 .
There are reasonable grounds for believing that any bidder is interested in more than one proposal on the same project , or that there has been collusion among the bidders .
Evidence of collusion will cause a rejection of all proposals in which the bidders involved are interested .
10 .
The apparent low bidder fails to complete and submit the Department form “ Certification Regarding Subcontractor Bid Quotes ” ( Bidders List ) electronically before the close of business ( 4:30PM Central Time ) within seven ( 7 ) calendar days after the date on which bids are required to be submitted .
11 .
A bidder fails to deposit bid escrow documentation , if required .
12 .
A bidder fails to acknowledge addenda .
13 .
A bidder does not obtain or have a license with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance ( TDCI ) , Board for Licensing Contractors ( BLC ) within twenty-one ( 21 ) days in accordance with 102.11 .
102.10 Proposal Guaranty With each electronic bid , submit an electronic Proposal Guaranty in accordance with the Instructions to Bidders .
Ensure that the Proposal Guaranty form is complete and furnished by a Surety as defined in 101.03 , and that the Proposal Guaranty has a Power of Attorney executed by the Surety .
The proposal and the Proposal Guaranty shall be valid and binding for sixty ( 60 ) days subsequent to the date of opening bids .
102.11 18 102.11 Licensing of Bidders All prime Contractors , except mowing and litter removal Contractors , must be licensed with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance , Board for Licensing Contractors ( BLC ) .
The Contractor must be licensed in the general classification ( e.g .

Contractors for mowing or litter removal type contracts must be registered with the Secretary of State ( i.e. , have a valid Certificate of Existence/Authorization ) , if applicable , before a Contract will be awarded .
A proposal submitted by a bidder will be considered for award for 21 days after the proposals are opened .
If the bidder does not have a license with the BLC , on or before twenty-one ( 21 ) days after proposals are opened , the bidder will be considered non-responsive and its proposal will be rejected as irregular .
The next lowest responsible bidder will then be considered for award .
If the next lowest responsible bidder does not have a license on or before the twenty-one ( 21 ) days after the proposals are opened , they also will be considered non-responsive , and the subsequent bidder will then be considered .
Bidders that are domestic or foreign corporations , limited liability companies , limited partnerships , or limited liability partnerships , must be in good standing with the Secretary of State ( i.e. , have a valid Certificate of Existence/Authorization ) .

104.11 Value Engineering Change Proposal ( VECP ) The Contractor may request a modification to the Plans , the Specifications , or other Contract requirements based on a Value Engineering Change Proposal ( VECP ) submitted to the Department specifying a cost reduction change .
This will not apply to a proposal unless it is identified as a VECP at the time of its submittal .
VECP are those proposals that would require a change in the Contract and would result in an immediate net savings to the Department without impairing the essential functions and characteristics of the Project , including but not limited to , any warranties , service life , reliability , economy of operation , and maintenance and safety features .
The Department will not normally consider VECPs that propose a total savings of less than $ 25,000 unless there are other non-monetary savings to be realized .
104.10 31 The Contractor may submit for review a “ VECP Concept ” provided that it contains enough information to clearly define the work involved and the benefits to be realized .
Provide all applicable design criteria that will be used in the VECP design .
Written notification by the Department that the review has been completed and that the VECP Concept appears to be favorable merely indicates that the engineering and plan development may continue for submittal of the VECP and is not authorization to begin any construction work contemplated by the VECP .
Should the final design not reflect the expected benefits , the Department may reject the VECP Concept and the VECP without recourse by the Contractor .
Submit the following information to the Engineer as a minimum , with each VECP , allowing adequate time for Department analysis and processing without interference with project schedules : 1 .
A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirements and the proposed change , and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each including cost and time savings .
2 .
An itemized list of the Contract changes required if the VECP is accepted , and any recommendation as to how to make each such change .
3 .
A separate detailed cost estimate for : a. the affected portions of the existing Contract requirements , and b. the VECP .
4 .
A prediction of the effects the proposed change will have on other Department costs , such as costs of maintenance and operation .
5 .
A statement of the time by which a Change Order must be issued in order to obtain the proposed cost reduction for the Project , noting the effect on the Contract completion time or delivery schedule .
6 .
The date ( s ) of known previous or concurrent submissions of the same VECP and previous actions by the Department .
7 .
The Contract items affected by the proposed change , including the associated quantity changes .
104.10 32 The Department may determine at any point during the evaluation process that the VECP is not cost effective and reject the VECP without recourse by the Contractor .
While a VECP is being considered by the Department , continue to perform the Work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract .
The Department shall not be liable for failure to accept or act upon any VECP within the proposed time for review and processing or for any delays to the Work due to the submitted VECP .
The Department will be the sole judge of the acceptance or rejection of a VECP , either wholly or in part .
If an agreement has not been reached by the date that the Contractor ’ s VECP specifies that a decision should be made , or such other date as the Contractor may have specified in writing , the VECP shall be deemed rejected .
The Contractor shall have no claim against the Department for additional costs or delays resulting from the rejection of a VECP , including but not limited to , VECP Concept or VECP acceptance , engineering and development costs , loss of anticipated profits , and increased material or labor costs .
The Department will not normally consider a VECP that would require any changes in pavement design , right-of-way , relocation of bridges , or any changes that would require modification of the approved environmental documents for the project .
Right-of-way can not be purchased as part of a VECP .
The Department will not accept a VECP that is similar to a change in the Plans or Specifications under consideration by the Department for the Project at the time the VECP is submitted ; nor will the Department accept a VECP based upon , or similar to , Standard Specifications , general use Special Provisions or Standard Drawings adopted by the Department after the advertisement for the Contract .
The Department reserves the right to make such changes without compensation to the Contractor in accordance with 104.02 .
The Department will determine the estimated net savings from the adoption of all or any part of the VECP .
In determining the estimated net savings , the Department may disregard the Contract bid prices if , in its judgment , such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be performed or to be deleted .
If the Department accepts the VECP , the Contractor grants to the Department all rights to adoption of the VECP for general use on other contracts without obligation or compensation of any kind .
104.10 33 Acceptance of a VECP will be by Change Order incorporating the changes necessary to allow the VECP , or any part of it , to be put into effect .
The Change Order will also set forth the estimated net savings to the Department and further provide that the Contractor be paid 50 % of the actual net savings .
The cost to develop , design , and implement the VECP , including redesign by a Tennessee-licensed engineer , preparation of new reproducible plans , and any other information requested by the Department to facilitate its review , is incidental to the Contractor and will not be reimbursed as part of the VECP net savings payment .
The cost to the Department to review the VECP is incidental to the Department and will not affect the VECP payment .
The Department will determine the actual net savings when the work in the VECP and Change Order is completed .
If upon completion of the work proposed in the VECP , the Department determines that the Change Order did not adequately address a change in quantities for other pay items that were either increased or decreased substantially as a result of the VECP , those additional costs or savings will be included in the actual net savings determination .
The Department will make a single payment to the Contractor representing 50 % of the actual net savings once all items are considered .
If the completed VECP results in an increase in cost such that there is no net savings , the Department will reimburse those costs above the original Contract amount reflected in the VECP and Change Order at a rate of 50 % .
The preparation of the VECP , its acceptance and performance of the work shall not extend the Contract completion time unless the Change Order provides for an extension .

108.07 Determination of Contract Time Extensions and Excusable Delays A .
General The Engineer will extend the Contract time or completion date only if an excusable delay , in accordance with 108.07.B and 108.07.C , affects the critical path of the Work shown on the accepted progress schedule .
Time extensions will be evaluated using the most recently submitted and accepted project schedule in accordance with 108.03 .
Notify the Engineer in accordance with 104.03 and submit a written request for a time extension including a schedule update with an analysis showing the impact of the delay on the critical path and documentation to support this request .
If the Engineer finds that the Work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor , and the request is justified , the Engineer will extend the time for completion by a properly executed Change Order in such amount , either calendar days or working days , as properly supported by the schedule analysis .
The extended time for completion will be in full force and effect as though it were the original time for completion .
If the Project does not require a schedule in accordance with 108.03 , and satisfactory fulfillment of the Contract requires a change to the Work in accordance with 104.02 , which may require a time extension , the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor ’ s request and determine whether the change has affected the completion of the Project .
If the change resulted in an increase in quantities for a major item of work , as defined in 101.03 , the Engineer may proportionally increase the Contract time allowed for performance of the major item of work .
If the Project contains an incentive provision for early completion and the Engineer has extended the Contract time or completion date , the incentive date for early completion will not be adjusted unless otherwise allowed in the Contract or approved by the Engineer .
108.07 88 B. Excusable , Non-Compensable Delays Excusable , non-compensable delays are delays that are not the fault of either the Contractor or the Department .

Utilities or Government Agencies .
Delays caused by utilities or government agencies unless caused by the failure of the Department to follow the procedures set forth in TCA §54-5-801 et seq .
4 .
Shortage of Materials .
Extraordinary delays in material deliveries that the Contractor can not foresee resulting from freight embargoes , government acts , or area wide material shortages .
5 .
Labor Disputes .
Delays from labor strikes that are beyond the Contractor ’ s , subcontractor ’ s , or supplier ’ s power to settle and not caused by improper acts or omissions of the Contractor or subcontractors .
If the Contractor incurs liquidated damages pursuant to 108.09 and if the Department extends the Contract time for an excusable , non- compensable delay , the Department will relieve the Contractor from associated liquidated damages under 108.09 commensurate with the time extension .
C. Excusable , Compensable Delays Excusable , compensable delays are delays affecting the critical path of Work that are determined to be the result of changes in the Work in accordance with 104.02 .
108.07 89 If the Contractor incurs liquidated damages pursuant to 108.09 and if the Department extends the Contract time for an excusable , compensable delay , the Department will relieve the Contractor from associated liquidated damages under 108.09 commensurate with the time extension .
The Department will determine compensation for delay in accordance with 109.06 .
D. Concurrent Delays Concurrent delays are separate critical delays that occur at the same time .
When an excusable , non-compensable delay is concurrent with an excusable , compensable delay , the Contractor is entitled to additional time but not entitled to additional compensation .
When a non-excusable delay is concurrent with an excusable delay , the Contractor is not entitled to a time extension or additional compensation .
108.08 Final Acceptance The Engineer will make final acceptance in accordance with 105.15 and the following : A .
State Funded Projects Upon presumptive completion of the Project and due notice from the Contractor , the Engineer will make an inspection .
If all items of work are satisfactorily completed , the Engineer will accept the Project and stop time charges as of the date of the inspection .
However , if the inspection reveals that some items of work remain to be completed , the Engineer will direct the Contractor to complete these items and continue charging time until all Work has been satisfactorily completed , regardless of the number of inspections required prior to final acceptance .
B. Federal-Aid Projects The procedure for Federal-aid projects will be the same as noted above for wholly State funded projects except that time charges will be suspended during the time interval between presumptive acceptance by the Engineer and the date of inspection by the FHWA .
Should the FHWA find any work unsatisfactory during the inspection , the Engineer will resume time charges from the day after the inspection date until the work is corrected .
In the event further inspections by 108.09 90 FHWA are required , the procedure described herein will be repeated until final acceptance of the Project .
108.09 Failure to Complete the Work on Time For each calendar day over and above the stipulated completion date on which any portion of the Work remains incomplete , the Department will deduct a sum of money from monies due the Contractor , not as a penalty but as liquidated damages .
The amounts to be deducted shall be as specified in Table 108.09-1 .
Table 108.09-1 : Liquidated Damages for Failure to Complete the Work on Time Original Contract Amount ( $ ) Daily Charge ( $ /day ) 0 to 500,000 250.00 > 500,000 to 1,000,000 420.00 > 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 740.00 > 2,000,000 to 10,000,000 1,000.00 > 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 1,600.00 > 20,000,000 1,800.00 Allowing the Contractor to continue and finish the Work or any part of it after the completion date , or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended , will in no way waive the rights of either party under the Contract .

C. Flocculants Furnish and apply flocculant materials to control erosion on disturbed areas and for use with sediment control devices to reduce turbidity from stormwater runoff .
1 .
Equipment .
If using a liquid application system , it may be necessary to pump a surfactant through the delivery system before injecting liquid flocculant and afterwards to prevent clogging of pipes and valves .
After applying flocculant materials , clean all application equipment according to the flocculant manufacturer ’ s recommendations to prevent the formation of dried residue that may impede future equipment performance .
Apply dry flocculant materials with a hand-held fertilizer spreader or a tractor-mounted spreader .
If approved by the flocculant manufacturer , the Contractor may mix certain dry flocculants with dry silica sand to aid in spreading .
2 .
Limitations .
Do not apply cationic PAM blends .
Do not apply flocculants directly to streams , wetlands , or other natural water resources ; to sediment ponds ; or to slopes that produce runoff directly into a stream , wetland , or other natural water resource .
Apply flocculants so that all flocculant-applied runoff flows into a sediment trap , sediment pond , or series of multiple sediment-control BMPs prior to discharge from the site .
Always use flocculants for both erosion and sediment control in conjunction with approved stormwater BMPs , as shown on the Standard Drawings .
Perform dry flocculant applications in dry weather conditions with light winds .
Do not apply anionic PAM during rainfall or onto saturated soils .
Do not apply flocculants over snow-covered surfaces or over surfaces of pure sand or gravel with no fines .
209.07 198 Apply flocculants at least 60 feet from any stream , wetland , or other natural water resource located on or adjacent to the construction site .
Do not apply emulsion forms of coagulant/flocculants directly to stormwater runoff or to streams , wetlands , or other water resources due to surfactant toxicity .
Emulsions may only be used to prepare liquid flocculants specifically used for erosion control applications , such as soil binders and tackifiers .
3 .
Preparation of Treatment Areas .
Before using flocculants , obtain and test site-specific soil samples to identify the optimum flocculant blends to use for effectiveness .
Obtain soil samples from each soil horizon to be accessed during excavation .
4 .
Application Requirements .
Use flocculants in conjunction with other BMPs ( with the bulk of structural sediment-control BMPs , including sediment ponds , positioned down slope of the flocculant- application areas ) to increase flocculant performance .
Direct stormwater runoff from flocculant-treated soils to pass through a series of sediment control BMPs prior to discharge to surface waters , with flow passing through a minimum of three enhanced rock check dams and a silt trap .
It is preferable that runoff from flocculant-treated areas be directed into a sediment pond .
Store flocculant materials in covered areas .
Many flocculants demonstrate a decrease in effectiveness after exposure to sunlight and air .
Anionic PAM loses its effectiveness within three months after exposure to sunlight and air .
Anionic PAM as well as certain other flocculant materials , when combined with water , become very slippery and can produce a safety hazard .
Take care to prevent spills of flocculants , in liquid , emulsion , or powder form , onto paved surfaces .
Application of flocculants will be most effective when applied as follows : 1 .
During rough grading operations ; 2 .
On stockpiles and borrow areas ; 3 .
Temporary haul roads before placement of crushed rock surface ; 209.07 199 4 .
Compacted soil road base ; 5 .
After final grading and before paving and/or final seeding ; 6 .
Along the interior surface area of ditches ; 7 .
Sites where work has been temporarily suspended ( e.g. , winter shutdown ) , and 8 .
Areas that will be mulched .
The use of a visible tracer or colorant to visibly track flocculant application is recommended .
For liquid applications of flocculants , use source water for mixing with a low turbidity ( 20 NTUs or less ) .
For turbidity reduction within sediment ponds , apply flocculants to conveyance ditches above the pond that discharge into the pond .
For dewatering and suspended solids removal of turbid pooled water within pipe tranches , silt traps , or other areas , flocculants may be introduced , in either liquid or solid forms , into the turbid water during pumping/evacuation of the pooled water , with the discharge either pumped through a filter bag or jute-lined treatment ditch prior to ultimate discharge .
Strictly adhere to the application rates as given in this specification for turbidity reduction for anionic PAM , and as given by the manufacturers ’ requirements for other types of flocculants , during dewatering .

Specific Gravity .
In cases where the effective combined specific gravity of the mineral aggregate exceeds 2.80 , the Department will adjust the tonnage of mineral aggregate , or plant produced mixture , for payment by multiplying the tonnage of mineral aggregate , or plant produced mixture , used by a specific gravity of 2.80 and dividing by the higher specific gravity .
3 .
Loss on Ignition ( LOI ) .
If the approved JMF includes a surface mixture of limestone with gravel , granite , slag , quartzite or gneiss , perform tests for the percent LOI of the limestone aggregate in the asphalt paving mix as specified in 407.03.E.3 .
If the percent of LOI in the aggregate differs by more than ±2 % from the LOI indicated in the JMF , the Department will make a payment deduction in the price bid for the mix , not as a penalty but as liquidated damages .
The percent of total payment to be deducted will be 5 times the percent that the LOI exceeds the JMF tolerance of ±2 % .
Replace or overlay all mix produced with aggregate tested and found to have a LOI that differs more than ±6 % from the LOI indicated in the JMF at no additional cost to the Department .
To determine the deduction , the Department will use lots of approximately 5,000 square yards .
The Department inspector will perform sampling and testing to establish the LOI according to the Department ’ s sampling and testing procedures .
If the initial tests indicate a variation in the LOI of greater than ±2 % than the value shown on the mix design , the Contractor shall perform the additional sampling necessary to establish the LOI of the aggregate in each lot , with the cost of the sampling being included in the contract unit prices bid for the paving items .
The Department will make deductions for excess variation in LOI under the item for Material Variation ( Deduction ) .

501.15 419 1 .
Sawing .
Begin sawing the joints as soon as concrete has hardened sufficiently to allow sawing without excessive raveling .
Once started , continue with the sawing operation until all transverse contraction joints are sawed .
When necessary , provide for bad weather or nighttime operations .
Omit the sawing of a joint if a crack occurs at or near the joint location before the time of sawing .
Discontinue the sawing of a joint when a crack develops ahead of the saw .
In general , saw all joints in sequence .
Saw all contraction joints in lanes adjacent to previously constructed lanes before uncontrolled or sympathy cracking occurs .
If extreme conditions exist that make it impracticable to prevent erratic cracking by early sawing , form a contraction joint groove at intervals of every third or fourth joint or as often as required prior to initial set of concrete as provided for under paragraph ( 2 ) below .
Immediately after sawing , thoroughly clean the joints of all residue by flushing with water under pressure .
Obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of all sawing equipment .
Only use lightweight sawing equipment on the newly constructed pavement .
( See 501.04.D.10 . )
The Contractor may use gang saw units or similar heavy equipment if the equipment is operated from a bridge or platform supported independently of the pavement .
2 .
Formed Joints .
Construct formed contraction joints during the placing of the concrete .
Form these joints by placing inserts in the plastic concrete , at the angle to the centerline of the pavement shown on the Plans and perpendicular to the surface .
When the concrete has attained its initial set and after the joint has been carefully finished , remove the insert .
Ensure that the groove so formed maintains its full width and depth as shown on the Plans , and the pavement at the joint meets surface requirements .
D. Transverse Construction Joints Construct transverse construction joints so as to provide a uniform surface .
Provide the surface texture specified ( see 501.16.G if needed ) .
Install transverse construction joints when an interruption of more than 30 minutes occurs during the concreting operations .
Do not construct transverse joints within 10 feet of an expansion joint , contraction joint , or plane of weakness .
If sufficient concrete has not been mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at least 10 feet long , remove the excess concrete back to the previous joint and dispose of as directed .
501.16 420 E. Expansion Joints at Structures Place premolded joint filler against all structures and features projecting through , into , or against the slab to form expansion joints .
Such joints shall extend the full depth of slab and , unless otherwise specified , shall be 1/2 inch in width .
501.16 Final Strike-Off , Consolidation and Finishing A. Sequence Perform operations in the following sequence : strike-off and consolidation , floating and removal of laitance , straight-edging , and final surface finish .
B. Finishing at Joints Consolidate concrete adjacent to joints to eliminate voids or segregation , against the joint material , under and around all load transfer devices , joint assembly units , and other features designed to extend into the pavement .
After the concrete has been placed and vibrated adjacent to the joints as specified in 501.12 , bring the finishing machine forward , operating it in a manner that will avoid damage or misalignment of joints .
C. Machine Finishing Distribute or spread the concrete as soon as placed .
Immediately after spreading , strike off and screed the concrete with an approved finishing machine that meets 501.04.D.1 .
When the pan-float finisher combination machine is used for finishing the pavement , longitudinal floats are not necessary .
Vibrators , for full width and depth vibration of concrete paving slabs , shall meet 501.04.D.1 .
If uniform and satisfactory consolidation of the concrete is not obtained by the vibratory method at joints , along forms , at structures , and throughout the pavement , furnish equipment and methods that will produce satisfactory work .
501.16 421 D. Hand Finishing The Engineer may allow hand finishing methods in the following situations : 1 .
Mechanical equipment breaks down after concrete has already been deposited on the grade .
2 .
Variable width sections make the use of finishing machines impracticable .
When the Engineer allows hand finishing , strike-off and screed the concrete as soon as it is placed .
Use a screed that is at least 2 feet longer than the maximum width of the slab to be struck off , of approved design , and sufficiently rigid to retain its shape .
When reinforcement is used in the pavement , provide a strike-off template for striking off the bottom layer of concrete .
Consolidate the concrete using a suitable vibrator and other approved equipment .
Repeat screeding until the surface is of uniform appearance , true to grade and cross-section , and free from porous areas .
E. Floating After the concrete has been struck off and consolidated , use one of the following methods to further smooth , true , and consolidate the concrete .
Do not over-finish , or add water to the surface , under either of these methods .
1 .
Hand Method .
If hand finishing is allowed as provided for under 501.16.D , use equipment and methods approved by the Engineer .
2 .
Mechanical Method .
Use the mechanical float described under 501.04.D.2 unless otherwise specified .
Adjust the tracks from which the float operates to the required cross-section .
Accurately adjust and coordinate the float with the adjustments of the transverse finishing machine so that a small amount of mortar is carried ahead of the float at all times .
If excessive evaporation is occurring , the Contractor may apply a light fog spray of water .
Adjust the forward speed so that the float will lap the distance directed by the Engineer on each transverse trip .
Pass the float 501.16 422 over each area of pavement at least two times , while preventing excessive operation over a given area .
Waste excess water or soupy material over the side forms on each pass .
After floating , remove excess water and laitance from the surface of the pavement with a straightedge 10 feet or more in length .
Lap successive drags one half the length of the blade .
F. Straightedge Testing and Surface Correction After the floating has been completed and the excess water removed , but while the concrete is still plastic , test the concrete surface for trueness using an accurate metal straightedge , not less than 15 feet in length , swung from handles at least 3 feet longer than half the width of the slab .
Hold the straightedge in contact with the surface in successive positions parallel to the road center-line , and go over the whole area from one side of the slab to the other as necessary .
Advance the straightedge along the road in successive stages of no more than half the length of the straightedge .
Immediately fill depressions found with freshly mixed concrete , and strike off , consolidate , and refinish the concrete .
Cut down and refinish high areas .
Ensure that the surface across joints meets these straightedge requirements .
Continue to perform straightedge testing and surface corrections until the entire surface is free from observable departures from the straightedge and the slab conforms to the required grade and cross-section .
If the Engineer determines superficial water is needed to assist in finishing , apply such water by lightly fogging .
G. Surface Texturing Texture the surface using a burlap drag , consisting of a seamless strip of damp burlap which , when dragged longitudinally along the full width of pavement , produces a uniform surface of gritty texture .
Maintain the drag in such condition that the resultant surface is of uniform appearance and reasonably free from grooves over 1/16 inch in depth .
After finishing the pavement by the burlap drag , texture the surface by forming transverse grooves .
Form the transverse grooves with mechanical equipment using a comb made of steel tines , vibrating beam roller , or other approved device .
The Contractor may use manual tools , such as rakes with spring steel tines , on areas inaccessible to 501.17 423 mechanical equipment , or areas of 1,000 square yards or less and variable width .
Form the grooves in the concrete at an appropriate time while the concrete is still in a plastic state , so that in the hardened concrete , the grooves will be between 0.09 and 0.13 inches in width , and between 0.12 and 0.19 inches in depth .
Space the grooves at random intervals between 0.3 and 1.0 inches .
Regardless of the method used to form the grooves , ensure that the grooves are relatively smooth and uniform , and are formed without excessive tearing of the surface and without bringing pieces of the coarse aggregate to the top of the surface .
If the equipment breaks down or experiences mechanical failure , the Contractor may use manual tools for grooving , provided all mixing and placing operations cease until proper repairs are made .
Correct , at no expense to the Department , all individual areas of 50 square yards or larger of the hardened grooved concrete that do not conform to these requirements , by cutting acceptable grooves in the hardened surface with an approved cutting machine or by other approved methods .
H. Edging at Forms and Joints After the final finish , but while the concrete is still in a plastic state , round the outside edges of the pavement to a 3/4-inch radius .
When pavement is formed along a lane line , round the edges to a 1/4-inch radius .
Round the edges of the pavement on each side of transverse expansion joints , formed joints , and transverse construction joints to a 1/4-inch radius .
Perform edging with an approved edging tool that will produce a well-defined and continuous radius .
Eliminate all tool marks formed by the edging tool by brushing to form a texture similar to the burlap drag finish .
501.17 Surface Testing , Pay Factors and Corrective Action All surface testing and any required corrective work shall be performed as soon as practicable and before sealing joints and opening to traffic .
501.17 424 A .
Surface Testing As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently , the Department will test the pavement surface with a 12-foot straightedge .
When the straightedge is placed parallel to the centerline of the pavement , the surface deviation from the lower edge of the straightedge shall not exceed 1/8 inch for mainline and auxiliary lanes and 1/4 inch for ramps .
In addition to the straightedge test , Rainhart Profilograph tests or Roadway Profiler tests of the pavement surface using a 0.1-inch blanking band will be performed on the following pavements : 1 .
Mainline pavement 2 .
Auxiliary lanes 3 .
Ramp sections where the design speed is greater than 40 miles per hour .
( a ) Test sections shall terminate 100 feet from a stop or slow speed yield condition ( b ) Test sections shall terminate at the beginning of a superelevation transition into a section not meeting the greater than 40-miles per hour criteria B .

Table 501.17-2 : Pay Factors & Corrective Action for Ramps with Posted Speeds of 40 mph Profile Indexes Pay Factor Corrective Action < 10 inches per mile 105 % None 10 to < 20 inches per mile 100 % None 20 to < 23 inches per mile 98 % Grind to 20 inches per mile 23 plus inches per mile 95 % Grind to 20 inches per mile Consider high speed ramps between freeways that do not have stop or yield conditions to be mainline pavement .
When the pavement being constructed longitudinally abuts an adjacent pavement constructed under a previous contract , the Department will test the adjacent pavement for smoothness .
If the profile index of the existing pavement surface exceeds the above limits , the Department will increase the allowable profile index of the pavement surface being constructed by half the difference between the profile index of the existing pavement surface and the requirements specified in the tables above .
To determine pavement sections where corrective work or pay adjustments will be necessary , the Department will evaluate the pavement in 0.1-mile sections .
Correct all areas represented by high points having deviations in excess of 0.4 inch in 25 feet or less and all sections having a Profile Index greater than the threshold for Corrective Action in Tables 501.17-1 and 501.17-2 .
After corrective action is complete , the Department will retest and evaluate the pavement .
Perform required corrective work with approved grinding equipment or by removing and replacing the pavement as directed by the Engineer .
Any area or section removed shall be no less than 10 feet in length and no less than the full width of the lane involved .
When it is necessary to remove and replace a section of pavement , also remove and replace all remaining portions of the slab adjacent to the joints that are less than 501.18 426 10 feet in length .
Perform all corrective work at no cost to the Department .
After the Contractor performs corrective grinding , the Department will test the affected pavement for thickness in accordance with 501.24 .
Establish positive means to remove grinding and grooving residue .
Remove solid residue from pavement surfaces before it gets blown by traffic action or wind .
Do not allow residue to flow across lanes used by public traffic or into gutters or drainage facilities .
Dispose of residue in a manner that will prevent residue , whether in solid or slurry form , from reaching any waterway in a concentrated state .
The Contractor may allow residue to continuously discharge on adjacent roadway slopes or ditches if the Engineer determines that there is sufficient vegetative cover to adequately filter the residue .
However , if the Engineer determines that there is not sufficient vegetative cover on the adjacent roadway slopes and ditches to adequately filter the residue , then collect the residue in approved storage tanks and deposit in settling basins , spread over flat vegetated areas , or filter by other means approved by the Engineer .
501.18 Curing Immediately after completing the finishing operations and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur , cover and cure the entire surface of the newly placed concrete .
Where curing requires the use of water , ensure that sufficient water is available .
Failure to provide a sufficient quantity of one of the curing materials specified in 913 , or lack of water for wet-curing methods , shall be cause for immediate suspension of concreting operations .

501.24 Tolerance in Pavement Thickness The Department will determine pavement thickness based on the average measurement of cores taken by the Contractor from each unit as defined in 501.24.A .
The Department will calculate the average thickness of each unit and determine the associated payment for the area represented in accordance with 501.24.B .
A .
Defining Units For the purpose of determining the pavement thickness and for establishing an adjusted unit price for pavement that is deficient in thickness , the Department will define separate units as follows , unless otherwise specified : 1 .
Placement widths of 1,000 feet in length , starting at the end of the pavement bearing the smaller station number , will be considered separate units .
The placement width is the width of a separately placed lane or lanes .
2 .
Last units having a length between 500 feet and 1,000 feet will be treated as separate units .
The Department will include last units having a length not exceeding 500 feet in the last full unit .
3 .
Units on interchange ramps will be considered separately from units on the main line .
4 .
Each intersection will be considered as one unit .
501.24 432 5 .
Crossovers , entrances , and similar small areas may be combined to form a unit of 1,000 square yards or less .
In each unit so established , the Department will make thickness measurements and apply price adjustments , if any , as specified in 501.24.B , for pavement units on the main line and ramps , except the location and spacing of cores will be as designated by the Engineer .
B .
Average Thickness Measurements and Payment Adjustments Take core samples at locations determined and witnessed by a Department representative and documented on the appropriate form .
When the measurement of the core from a unit is within 1/4 inch from the Plan thickness , the Department will make full payment for the pavement in the area represented .
When such measurement is deficient by more than 1/4 inch but not more than 1 inch from the Plan thickness , the Department will direct two additional cores to be taken from within the unit at intervals of not less than 300 feet , and will determine the average of the three cores .
If the average measurement of these three cores is within 1/4 inch of the Plan thickness , the Department will make full payment .
If the average thickness of the three cores is deficient by more than 1/4 inch but not more than 1 inch from the Plan thickness , the Department will pay an adjusted price , determined in accordance with 501.26.B , for the area represented by these cores .
In calculating the average thickness of the pavement unit , the Department will consider measurements that exceed the average thickness by more than 1/4 inch as the specified thickness plus 1/4 inch , and will exclude from the average measurements that are less than the specified thickness by more than 1 inch .
When the measurement of any core is less than the specified thickness by more than 1 inch , the Department will determine the actual thickness of the pavement in this area from additional cores taken at not less than 10-foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction from the affected location until a core is found , in each direction , that is not deficient by more than 1 inch .
The Engineer will evaluate areas found deficient in thickness by more than 1 inch , and if , in the Engineer ’ s judgment , the deficient areas warrant removal , the Contractor shall remove and replace them , at no additional cost to the 501.25 433 Department , with concrete of the thickness shown on the Plans .
The Department will not include exploratory cores for areas deficient by more than 1 inch in thickness when determining averages for adjusted unit prices .
COMPENSATION 501.25 Method of Measurement The Department will measure Portland Cement Concrete Pavement ( Plain ) and Portland Cement Concrete Pavement ( Reinforced ) of the various thicknesses specified , by the square yard in accordance with 109 .
The Department will measure additional concrete required to level individual ramps , including acceleration and deceleration lanes , containing 4,500 square yards or less , by the cubic yard .
Where a ramp becomes a traffic lane without a tapered acceleration lane , or a traffic lane becomes a ramp without a tapered deceleration lane , the Department will consider 300 feet of the lane , measured from the point of intersection with the adjoining lanes , as an acceleration or deceleration lane to be included in the ramp .
To determine the number of cubic yards of additional concrete , the Department will deduct the theoretical quantity and all wasted concrete from the number of cubic yards actually used , as determined from invoices or conversion from batch weights .
The Department will not measure for payment additional concrete used for leveling on main line roadway or ramps that contain more than 4,500 square yards .
501.26 Basis of Payment A .

Payment for Portland Cement Concrete Shoulders , of the type and thickness shown on the Plans , includes all labor , equipment , materials , and incidentals required to construct transverse joints in the Portland cement concrete shoulders .
For pavement found deficient in thickness by more than 1/4 inch but not more than 1 inch , the Department will pay only the reduced price specified in 501.26.B .
No additional payment over the contract unit bid price will be made for pavement that has an average thickness in excess of that shown on the Plans .
The Department will pay for additional concrete used for leveling on ramps that contain 4,500 square yards or less based on the invoice price of the concrete when the concrete is purchased from a ready-mix producer .
If the concrete is mixed on the Project by the Contractor , the price per cubic yard will be based on the invoice price of the materials plus 20 % .
The Department will make payment only on that portion of additional concrete that exceeds 4 % of the theoretical quantity ; no payment will be made for additional concrete exceeding 10 % of the theoretical quantity .
The Department will pay for additional concrete , measured in accordance with 501.25 , at the purchase price , F.O.B .

602.05 447 B .
Quality Assurance ( QA ) Shop Inspection At least 6 weeks before starting shop fabrication , provide written notification to the Division of Structures , with a copy to the Engineer , as to the location and schedule of the fabrication of structural steel , so that the Department may arrange for QA shop inspection .
The Department will pay for the cost of this QA inspection , limited to the rates set forth in the Special Provisions for each weight range .
To establish the maximum inspection cost to be paid by the Department , the Department will multiply the per pound inspection cost for each specified weight range by the applicable steel poundage within its weight range .
The Department will deduct the cost of all structural steel inspection ( QA ) in excess of this maximum cost from monies due the Contractor .
The cost for structural steel inspection ( QA ) includes the cost of an inspection agency hired by the Department to perform shop inspection ( QA ) of steel fabrication .
The Contractor may obtain a detailed description of the duties of an inspection agency from the Engineer .
The shop inspection performed by the inspection agency hired by the Department is intended as QA to assure to the Department that the fabricator is following all quality control requirements and is providing a product conforming to the Contract requirements .
The inspection agency is not instructed or expected to replace the fabricator ’ s quality control .
The inspection and acceptance of the work performed by the Department ’ s inspection agency does not relieve the fabricator of providing materials and finished products as specified .
The Department may reject defective or non-conforming materials at any time .
Replace rejected materials promptly at no additional cost to the Department .
Include the cost of nondestructive testing in the lump sum bid price for steel structures .
602.05 General A .
Type of Construction The type of construction shall be welded or bolted , as shown on the Plans .
602.05 448 B. Workmanship and Finish Workmanship and finish shall be in accordance with the American Institute of Steel Construction ( AISC ) best general practices in modern bridge shops .
Provide a neat finish to portions of the work exposed to view .
C. Storage of Materials Store material , either plain or fabricated , above the ground on platforms , skids , or other supports .
Keep materials free from dirt , grease , or other foreign matter , and provide appropriate protection from corrosion .
D. Straightening Material Ensure that rolled material , before being laid off or worked , is straight .
If straightening is necessary , use methods that will not damage the metal .
Only perform heat straightening of ASTM A709 , Grade 100W , 244 ( ASTM A514 ) or ASTM A517 steel under rigidly controlled procedures , with each application subject to the Engineer ’ s approval .
Do not allow the maximum temperature of the steel to exceed 1100 °F as set forth in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Highway Bridge Fabrication with High Performance Steel , current edition , and the AASHTO Bridge Welding Code , current edition .
The Engineer will reject material with sharp kinks and bends .
To straighten plates , angles , other shapes , and built-up members when permitted by the Engineer , use methods that will not fracture or otherwise damage the metal .
Straighten distorted members by mechanical means or , if approved by the Engineer , by carefully planned procedures and supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat .
However , to heat straighten AASHTO M 270 ( ASTM A709 ) Grades HPS70W and 100W steel members , adhere to the AASHTO Guide Specification for Highway Bridge Fabrication with High Performance Steel , current edition , and the AASHTO Bridge Welding Code , current edition , with each application subject to the Engineer ’ s approval .
Do not exceed the maximum temperatures specified in Table 602.05-1 .
602.05 449 Table 602.05-1 : Heat Straightening Grade Maximum Temperature , degrees F Grade HPS70W > 6 inches from weld 1100 °F Grade HPS70W < 6 inches from weld 900 °F Grade 100W > 6 inches from weld 1100 °F Grade 100W < 6 inches from weld 950 °F In all other steels , do not allow the temperature of the heated area to exceed 1200 °F , as controlled by temperature indicating crayons , liquids , or either contact or non-contact infrared thermometers .
Heating in excess of the limits shown will be cause for rejection , unless the Engineer allows testing to verify material integrity .
Keep parts to be heat straightened substantially free of stress and from external forces , except stresses resulting from mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat .
The Engineer will reject pieces showing evidence of fracture following straightening of a bend or buckle .
E. Heat Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders 1 .
Materials .
Do not perform heat-curving in steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum yield point greater than 70,000 pounds per square inch .
2 .
Type of Heating .
Curve beams and girders by either continuous or V-type heating as approved by the Engineer .
602.05 450 a .
Continuous Method .
For the continuous method , heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flanges simultaneously .
Ensure that the strip is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
b. V-type Heating .
For V-type heating , heat the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate and in regularly spaced truncated triangular or wedge-shaped areas having their base along the flange edge .
Determine the spacing and temperature of areas necessary to obtain the required curvature .
On the inside flange surface , terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area just before the juncture of the web and the flange .
To avoid web distortion , take special care when heating the inside flange surfaces ( the surfaces that intersect the web ) so that heat is not applied directly to the web .
When the radius of curvature is 1,000 feet or more , extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than 1,000 feet , extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to 1/8 of the flange or 3 inches , whichever is less .
The truncated triangular pattern shall have an included angle of approximately 15 to 30 degrees and a base of no greater than 10 inches .
The Engineer may approve variations in these patterns .
For both types of heating , the flange edges to be heated are those that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .
Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is only required when the flange thickness is 1-1/4 inches or greater , in which case , heat the two surfaces concurrently .
3 .
Temperature .
Conduct the heat-curving operation so that the temperature of the steel does not exceed 1200 °F for Grades 36 , 50 , 50W , and HPS50W ; and 1100 °F for Grades HPS70W and 100W , as measured by temperature-indicating crayons or other suitable means .
Do not artificially cool the girder until after it has naturally cooled to 600 °F ; the method of artificial cooling is subject to the Engineer ’ s approval .
4 .
Position for Heating .
The girder may be heat-curved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
602.05 451 When curving girders with the web in the vertical position , brace or support the girder to prevent it from overturning .
When curving with the web in the horizontal position , support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points , if required , to obtain uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder and externally applied loads to exceed the usual allowable design stress .
During heating , maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the mid-length of the girder within 2 inches of the flanges to avoid a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
5 .
Sequence of Operations .
Heat-curve the girder before painting , and either before or after completing all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners .
However , unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage , locate and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required , heat-curve or oxygen-cut them separately , and then weld them to the curved girder .
When attaching cover plates to rolled beams , attach them before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than 2-1/2 inches and the radius of curvature is greater than 1,000 feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates , heat-curve the beams before attaching the cover plates .
Either heat-curve or oxygen-cut cover plates separately , and then weld them to the curved beam .
6 .
Camber .
Camber girders before heat curving .
Camber rolled beams by heat-cambering methods approved by the Engineer .
For plate girders , cut the web to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting , welding , and heat curving .
If necessary , correct moderate deviations from specified camber by a carefully supervised application of heat , as approved by the Engineer .
7 .
Measurement of Curvature and Camber .
The Engineer will measure horizontal curvature and vertical camber for final acceptance after all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
The Engineer will check horizontal curvature with the girder in the vertical position .
602.06 452 8 .
Finish .
Provide a neat finish to exposed portions of the work .
Perform shearing , flame cutting , and chipping carefully and accurately .
602.06 Bolt Holes A. Holes for High Strength Bolts and Unfinished Bolts1 Punch or drill all bolt holes .
Material forming parts of a member composed of not more than five thicknesses of metal may be punched 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts where the thickness of the material is not greater than 3/4 inch for structural steel , 5/8 inch for high-strength steel , or 1/2 inch for quenched and tempered alloy steel , unless sub-punching and reaming is required under 602.09 .
Where there are more than five thicknesses , or when any of the main material is thicker than 3/4 inch for structural steel , 5/8 inch for high- strength steel , or 1/2 inch for quenched and tempered alloy steel , either sub-drill and ream or drill holes full size .
If required under 602.09 , either sub-punch or sub-drill ( sub-drill if thickness limitation governs ) all holes 3/16 inch smaller , and , after assembling , ream 1/16 inch larger , or drill full size to 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts .
The Department will only allow use of enlarged or slotted holes with high-strength bolts 5/8 inch or larger in diameter where shown on the design drawings .
B. Holes for Ribbed Bolts , Turned Bolts or other Approved Bearing Type Bolts The Fabricator may either sub-punch or sub-drill all holes for ribbed bolts , turned bolts , or other approved bearing-type bolts 3/16 inches smaller than the nominal diameter of the bolt , and then ream , assemble or drill to a steel template or , after assembly , drill from the solid .
In any case , ensure that the finished holes provide a driving fit as shown on the Plans or specified in the Special Provisions .
1 See 602.16 for bolts included in designation `` Unfinished Bolts . ''
602.07 453 602.07 Punched Holes Use a die diameter that is not more than 1/16 inch larger than the punch diameter .
Ream holes that must be enlarged to admit bolts .
Ensure that holes are cleanly cut without torn or ragged edges .
Poor matching of holes will be cause for rejection .
602.08 Reamed or Drilled Holes Ream or drill holes so they are cylindrical and perpendicular to the member and sized to comply with 602.06 .
Where practicable , direct reamers using mechanical means .
Remove burrs on the outside surfaces .
Poor matching of holes will be cause for rejection .
Ream and drill holes with twist drills .
If required by the Engineer , take apart assembled pieces to remove burrs caused by drilling .
Assemble and securely hold together connecting parts that are being reamed or drilled and match-mark before disassembling .
602.09 Preparation of Field Connections A. Sub-punching and Reaming of Field Connections Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions or shown on the Plans , sub-punch ( or sub-drill if sub-drilling is required ) the holes in all field connections and field splices of main members of trusses , arches , continuous beam spans , bents , towers ( each face ) , plate girders , and rigid frames , as specified in 602.06 , and subsequently ream while assembled or to a steel template , as specified in 602.13 .
Sub-punch all holes for floor beam and stringer field connections , and ream to a steel template or while assembled .
When reaming or drilling full size field connection holes through a steel template , accurately locate and position the template and firmly bolt in place before drilling .
Ensure that templates used for reaming matching members , or the opposite faces of a single member , are exact duplicates .
Accurately locate templates used for connections on like parts or members so that the parts or members are duplicates and require no match-marking .
For any connection , instead of sub-punching and reaming or sub- drilling and reaming , the Fabricator may drill holes full size with all thicknesses of material assembled in proper position .
602.10 454 The Special Provisions or the Plans will identify if any additional sub- punching and reaming is required .
B. Numerically Controlled ( N/C ) Drilled Field Connections 1 .
General .
For any connection or splice specified in 602.09.A , instead of drilling undersized holes and reaming while assembled , or drilling holes full size while assembled , the Contractor may use N/C drilling equipment to drill bolt holes full-size in unassembled pieces and/or connections including templates for use with matching undersized and reamed holes .
If N/C drilling equipment is used , the Engineer , unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions or shown on the Plans , may require the Contractor , by means of check assemblies , to demonstrate that this drilling procedure consistently produces holes and connections meeting 602.11 and 602.13 .
Submit to the Engineer for approval a detailed outline of the proposed procedures for accomplishing the work , from initial drilling through check assembly , if required .
Identify in the submittal the specific members of the structure that may be N/C drilled , the sizes of the holes , the location of common index and other reference points , composition of check assemblies , and all other pertinent information .
2 .
Holes .
Ensure that holes drilled by N/C drilling equipment are drilled to appropriate size either through individual pieces or any combination of pieces held tightly together .
602.10 Accuracy of Punched and Drilled Holes Punch holes so that , after assembling ( before any reaming is done ) , a cylindrical pin 1/8 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole may be entered perpendicular to the face of the member , without drifting , in at least 75 % of the contiguous holes in the same plane .

Galvanized nuts shall be grade DH .
Supply the Materials and Tests Division with samples of bolts , nuts , and washers used on the Project for purposes of testing ( provide three per shipping lot ) .
Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis , use a hardened beveled washer to compensate for the lack of parallelism .
Use hardened beveled washers for American Standard Beams and Channels .
The washers shall be square or rectangular , shall conform to the requirements of AASHTO M 293 ( ASTM F436 ) and AASHTO M 253 , and shall taper in thickness .
Where necessary , washers may be clipped on one side from the center of the washer to a point not closer than 7/8 times the bolt diameter .
Hardened washers are not required for connections using AASHTO M 164 ( ASTM A325 ) and AASHTO M 253 ( ASTM A490 ) bolts except as follows : 1 .
Use hardened washers under the turned element when tensioning is to be performed by the calibrated wrench method .

Using multiple hardened washers with a combined thickness equal to or greater than 5/16 inch does not satisfy this requirement .
6 .
Where AASHTO M 164 ( ASTM A325 ) bolts of any diameter or ASTM A490 bolts equal to or less than 1 inch in diameter are to be installed in a long slotted hole in an outer ply , use a plate washer or continuous bar of at least 5/16 inch thickness with standard holes .
The washers or bars shall have a size sufficient to completely cover the slot after installation and shall be of structural grade material , but need not be hardened except as follows .
When ASTM A490 bolts over 1 inch in diameter are to be used in long slotted holes in external plies , use a single hardened washer conforming to AASHTO M 293 ( ASTM F436 ) , but with 5/16 inch minimum thickness , instead of washers or bars of structural grade material .
Using multiple hardened washers with combined thickness equal to or greater than 5/16 inch does not satisfy this requirement .
7 .
Alternate design fasteners conforming to Article 11.3.2.6 , with a geometry that provides a bearing circle on the head or nut 602.17 461 with a diameter equal to or greater than the diameter of hardened washers conforming to AASHTO M 293 ( ASTM F436 ) , satisfy the requirements for washers specified herein and may be used without washers .

6 .
Direct Tension Indicators ( DTIs ) a .
Use Direct Tension Indicators ( DTIs ) for each bolt .
Do not use DTIs on weathering steel , and therefore all bolts shall be installed by either turn-of-nut tightening or 602.17 463 calibrated wrench tightening in accordance with the construction specifications of the AASHTO Bridge Specifications identified on the Plans .
The load indicator average gap shall be 0.005 inch .
After the joint has been properly pinned , tighten the joint to approximately half the specified tension to ensure firm contact of all plies , and then tighten the joint by systematically progressing from the center most rigid part to the free edges .
Re- tightening may be necessary to restore tension if gaps increase from original measurements .
b .
Maintain a tension calibrator , such as a Skidmore Wilhelm , on the Project during all bolting operations .
The Engineer will check the bolt tension versus the average gap of the DTI daily to ensure correct tension .
c. Supply the Materials and Tests Division with samples of bolts , nuts , and washers used on the project for purposes of testing ( provide three per shipping lot ) .
d. Ship bolts , nuts , and washers in sealed containers , labeled with the supplier ’ s name and lot identification .
Ensure that the containers are capable of protecting the bolts from moisture and other contaminants until they are opened at the site .
Damaged containers are cause for rejection .
e. Verify the DTI ’ s performance as specified in 602.17.E.3 .
f. Install DTIs by one of the following three methods unless otherwise approved by the Engineer .
( 1 ) Place the DTI under the bolt head and turn the nut to tighten .

Place the hardened flat washer between the nut and the DTI .
The protrusions on the DTI shall face the underside of the hardened flat washer and nut and the gap in the DTI reduced to 0.005 inch .
This method is suggested when it is too difficult to 602.17 464 see the bolt head for inspection , or when the wrench operator wants to the see the gap .
( 3 ) Place the DTI under the bolt head and turn the bolt head to tighten .
Place the hardened flat washer between the bolt head and the DTI .
The protrusions on the DTI shall face the underside of the hardened flat washer and bolt head and the gap in the DTI reduced to 0.005 inch .
This method is suggested when it is too difficult to see the nut for inspection , or when the wrench operator wants to the see the gap .

3 .
Verification and Installation of High Strength Bolts with Direct Tension Indicators ( DTIs ) a. Verification of DTI Performance .
If installing DTIs with high strength bolts to indicate bolt tension , perform the verification testing described below , and install the DTIs in accordance with the method specified below .
Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer , install the DTIs under the head of the bolt and turn the nut to tighten the fastener .
Follow the manufacturer ’ s recommendations to properly orient the DTI and additional washers , if any , required for the correct use of the DTI .
In the presence of the Engineer , perform verification testing in a calibrated bolt tension measuring device .
Use a special flat insert in place of the normal bolt head holding insert .
Perform three verification tests for each combination of fastener rotational-capacity lot , DTI lot , and DTI position relative to the turned element ( bolt head or nut ) to be used on the project .
Tighten the fastener by turning the element not against the DTI .
Do not allow the element ( bolt head or nut ) against the DTI to rotate .
The purpose of the verification testing is to ensure that the fastener will be at or above the desired installation tension when half or more of the spaces in the DTI have a gap of less than 0.005 inch and that the fastener will 602.17 471 not undergo excessive plastic deformation at the minimum gap allowed on the Project .
Conduct the verification test as follows : 1 .
Install the bolt , nut , and DTI assembly in a manner so that at least three and preferably not more than five threads are located between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head .
2 .
Tighten the fastener first to the load equal to that specified in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-10 under Verification Tension for the grade and diameter of fastener .
If an impact wrench is used , it is acceptable to tighten to a load slightly below that required and then use a manual wrench to attain the required tension .
3 .
Determine and record the number of refusals of a 0.005-inch tapered feeler gage in the spaces between the protrusions .
The number of spaces between protrusions is listed below in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-10 .
The number of refusals shall not exceed the number listed under Maximum Verification Refusals in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-10 below for the grade and diameter of bolt for un-coated DTIs .
The maximum number of refusals for coated DTIs ( galvanized , painted or epoxy coated ) used under the turned element shall not exceed the number of spaces on the DTI less one .
The DTI lot is rejected if the number of refusals exceeds the values in the applicable table or , for coated DTIs , if the gage is refused in all spaces .
4 .
After the number of refusals is recorded at the verification load , further tighten the fastener until the 0.005-inch feeler gage is refused at all the spaces and a visible gap exists in at least one space .
5 .
Record the load at this condition and remove the fastener from the tension measuring device .
602.17 472 6 .
Ensure that the nut can be reassembled by hand for the complete thread length of the bolt excluding thread run-out .
If the nut can not be assembled for this thread length , the DTI lot is rejected unless the load recorded is less than 95 % of the average load measured in the rotational capacity test of the fastener lot as specified in 908.04.C.3.g .
If the bolt is too short to be tested in the calibration device , test the DTI on a long bolt in a calibrator to determine the number of refusals at the Verification Tension listed in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-10 below .
The number of refusals shall not exceed the values listed under Maximum Verification Refusals .
Then test another DTI from the same lot with the short bolt in a convenient hole in the work .
Tighten the fastener assembly until the 0.005-inch feeler gage is refused in all spaces and a visible gap exists in at least one space .
Disassemble the fastener .
Ensure that the nut can be reassembled by hand for the complete thread length of the bolt excluding thread run-out .
Reject the DTI lot if the nut can not be assembled to this thread length .
b .
Installation .
Install fasteners using DTIs in two stages .
Prevent rotation of the fastener element during each stage of the installation .
1 .
First , snug the connection with bolts installed in all the holes of the connection .
Then , tighten the bolts sufficiently to bring all the plies of the connection into firm contact .
Ensure that the number of spaces in which a 0.005 inch-feeler gage is refused in the DTI after snug does not exceed those listed under Maximum Verification Refusals in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-910 for the grade and diameter of bolt .
If the numbers exceed the values in the table , remove the fastener , install another DTI , and re-snug the fastener .
2 .
Further tighten the connection until the number of refusals of the 0.005-inch feeler gage is equal to or greater than the number listed under Minimum Installation Refusals in Tables 602.17-9 and 602.17-10 for the grade and diameter of bolt .
If the 602.17 473 fastener is tightened so that no visible gap in any space remains , remove the bolt and DTI , and replace with a new properly tightened fastener and DTI .

Use another wrench on the bolt head to prevent rotation of the head against the DTI if the DTI is to be used under the unturned element .
3 .
Further tighten the bolt to tension specified in Table 602.17-11 ( which is 1.05 times the required installation tension of the bolt ) .
Use another wrench on the bolt head to prevent rotation of the head against the DTI if the DTI is to be used under the unturned element .
If an impact wrench is used , tighten to a load slightly below the required load and use a manual wrench to attain the required tension .
The load indicating needle of the bolt calibrator can not be read accurately when an impact wrench is used .
602.17 475 Table 602.17-11 Bolt Diameter ( inches ) Bolt Tension ( kips ) AASHTO M 164 Bolts ( ASTM A325 ) ASTM A490 Bolts 1/2 13 N/A 5/8 20 N/A 3/4 29 37 7/8 41 51 1 54 67 1-1/8 59 84 1-1/4 75 107 1-3/8 89 127 1-1/2 108 N/A 4 .
Determine and record the number of spaces between the protrusions on the DTI that a 0.005-inch thickness gage is refused .
The total number of spaces in the various sizes and grade of DTIs is listed in Table 602.17-12 .
602.17 476 Table 602.17-12 Bolt Diameter ( inches ) Number of Spaces AASHTO M 164 Bolts ( ASTM A325 ) ASTM A490 Bolts 1/2 4 N/A 5/8 4 N/A 3/4 5 6 7/8 5 6 1 6 7 1-1/8 6 7 1-1/4 7 8 1-3/8 7 8 1-1/2 8 N/A 5 .
The number of spaces that the 0.005-inch thickness gage is refused should not exceed the number specified in Table 602.17-13 .
If the number of spaces exceeds the number in the table , the DTI fails the verification test .
Table 602.17-13 : Verification Criteria ( 1 ) Number of Spaces in Washer Maximum Number of Spaces Gage is Refused 4 1 5 2 6 2 7 3 8 3 ( 1 ) If the test is a coated DTI under the turned element , the maximum number of spaces the gage is refused is the number of spaces on the washer minus one .
602.18 477 6 .
Further tighten the bolt to the smallest gap to be allowed in the work .
Normally , this smallest gap is defined as the gap at all the spaces less than 0.005 inch and not all gaps completely closed .
Ensure that the 0.005-inch gage is refused at all spaces , but a visible gap exists in at least one space .
The bolts in this test and in the actual installation should not be installed to a no visible gap condition .
The load in the bolt becomes indeterminate when no gap exists .
Failure of the bolt due to over-tightening may occur if the bolt is tightened beyond complete crushing of the DTI .
7 .
Remove the bolt from the calibrator and turn the nut on the threads of the bolt by hand .
The nut should be able to be turned on the complete length of the threads , excluding the thread run-out .
If the nut is unable to go the full thread length , the load required for the minimum gap in Step 6 is too large .
The test must be repeated with a larger minimum gap , for example , one space that will accept a 0.005-inch feeler gage to establish the smallest gap allowed in the work for the fastener rotational-capacity lot allowed in the work .
8 .
Bolts from rotational-capacity lots that are too short to fit in the tension measuring device shall be tested by tightening to the minimum gap in Step 6 and checked in accordance with Step 7 .
The DTI used with the short bolt should be checked in accordance with Steps 1 through 5 using a longer bolt in the tension measuring device .

+ Req .
* ( 10 % ) Req .
+ Req .
* ( 15 % ) If the acceptance cylinders fail to meet the specified strengths , the Contractor may drill core samples from the hardened concrete as verification of concrete strength instead of using the concrete cylinders .
The Contractor must provide QC data from companion cylinders that meet or exceed the required strength , and perform a nondestructive test using a Swiss Hammer on the concrete to prove required strength is achieved under the observance of a Materials and Tests Representative .
If the above mentioned requirements are met , the Contractor may then elect to drill a maximum of three core samples per set of cylinders from the hardened concrete .
The Contractor shall obtain the cores in accordance with the Department ’ s Standard Operating Procedure 4-2 , and bear all costs of obtaining the cores and repairing the core holes .
Acceptance for payment may be based on cores provided by the Contractor at its expense .
These cores shall meet the strength requirements specified in Table 604.15-1 .
The Engineer will not accept concrete cylinders and cores submitted for testing beyond 56 days .
The average compressive strength of the two cores taken to represent the low test cylinders will be considered to be the acceptance strength of the in-place concrete , provided that the cores are obtained and tested within 56 days after concrete placement .
In accordance with 604.31 , the Engineer will accept at reduced pay concrete that meets the required strengths specified in 604.03 for the respective class , but fails to meet the requirements in Table 604.15-1 .
604.16 544 All concrete used shall undergo acceptance testing .
The Department will determine the method to formally accept in-place concrete that is represented by acceptance cylinders that have been lost , damaged , or destroyed .

604.16 Placing Concrete A .
General Do not place concrete until the Engineer has checked and approved forms and reinforcing steel .
Ensure that the forms are clean of all debris and are kept wet immediately before concrete is placed .
Obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of the method and sequence of placing concrete .
Unless otherwise allowed , place all concrete in daylight .
Do not start placing concrete in any portion of a structure unless it can be entirely completed in daylight .
When the placing of concrete is allowed during other than daylight hours , provide and operate an adequate and approved artificial lighting system .
Plans for nighttime operations , including adequate lighting , shall be acceptable to the Engineer .
Use tools of an approved type to thoroughly work concrete during placing operations .
The working shall be such as to force all coarse aggregate from the surface and to bring mortar against the forms to produce a smooth finish , substantially free from water and air pockets , or honeycomb .
If the forms show bulging or settlement while concrete is being placed , stop placing until a correction has been made .
Construct T-beam girders , slabs , arch rings , and all horizontal sections , except curbs and sidewalks , monolithically and continuously , unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer .
Construct curbs and sidewalks after the bridge deck is completed , unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
After initial set and before final set of the concrete , do not jar forms or place any strain on the ends of projecting reinforcement .
Drive piles no closer than 20 feet to footings that are less than 7 days old and to foundations supporting concrete that is less than 7 days old .
604.16 545 Unless otherwise specified , before placing a bridge deck overlay of Class D or Class L concrete , machine scarify the surface to be covered to a minimum depth of 1 inch .
In areas inaccessible to machine scarifying , and in areas of spalling where steel reinforcement is exposed , remove deteriorated concrete using hand tools or other methods approved by the Engineer .
After scarifying , clean the deck of all deleterious material .
Do not allow traffic on the scarified deck .
Take care to avoid contaminating the surface of the bridge deck after scarification .
Remove all contaminants from the deck to the Engineer ’ s satisfaction before placing the concrete overlay .
When placing concrete in bridge decks when the rate of moisture evaporation may be excessive as determined by the Engineer , comply with the following additional requirements .
1 .
Do not start any concrete deck pours until the mandatory Bridge Deck Construction Pre-pour Meeting is conducted and all pertinent considerations covered by the Pre-Pour Check List are resolved .
2 .
Protect the concrete to prevent rapid drying due to high temperature , low humidity , high winds , or combinations thereof .
Do not place any concrete when the rate of moisture evaporation from the freshly placed concrete exceeds 0.2 pounds per square foot per hour as determined by Figure 604.16-1 below .
Provide the Engineer appropriate measuring devices meeting industry standards to establish the temperature of the concrete and ambient air , relative humidity , and wind velocity adjacent to the concrete surface .
604.16 546 Figure 604.16-1 : ACI nomograph for estimating rate of evaporation of surface moisture from concrete 3 .
If data collected during the 24 hours prior to the pour , or predictions from the National Weather Service indicate that the moisture evaporation rate of 0.2 pounds per square foot per hour may be exceeded , limit concrete placement to hours when the evaporation rate is less than 0.2 pounds per square foot per hour .
An exception to this requirement would if the 604.16 547 Contractor demonstrates to the Engineer ’ s satisfaction before the pour that protection can be provided , or other actions taken , to maintain an acceptable moisture evaporation rate .
Schedule placement of bridge deck concrete accordingly .
Notwithstanding all precautions , if during concrete placement , the evaporation rate of 0.2 pounds per square foot per hour is exceeded , terminate the pour as directed by the Engineer .
In hot weather , apply a certified dry fog with a maximum volume mean diameter ( VMD ) of 15 microns with a throw distance of 60 feet above the concrete surface during placement and finishing operations .
Furnish a certification to the Engineer verifying the VMD .
In addition , immediately before placing the concrete , cool the forms and reinforcing steel to 90 °F or less by using a fine spray of water , leaving no puddles or pockets of water .
Sprinkle trucks or keep them in the shade when not being unloaded to help reduce the temperature of the concrete .
Use one of the four following methods at the discharge point when pumping concrete : 1 .

604.16 548 B. Railings and Curbing When constructing curb , take care in installing railing steel or anchoring devices .
Do not construct concrete railings on any structure until the falsework has been struck .
C. Chutes and Troughs Place concrete so as to prevent segregation of materials and displacement of reinforcement .
Keep all chutes , troughs , and pipes clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after each run .
Discharge the water used for flushing clear of the concrete already in place .
Take care to fill each part of the form by depositing the concrete as near final position as possible .
Work the coarse aggregate back from the forms and around the reinforcement without displacing the bars .
D. Vibrating Unless otherwise directed , compact the concrete with suitable mechanical vibrators operating within the concrete .
When required , in addition to vibrating , also hand spade with suitable tools to ensure proper and adequate compaction .
Manipulate vibrators so as to work the concrete thoroughly around the reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into corners and angles of the forms .
Do not use vibrators to cause concrete to flow or run into position .
The vibration at any point shall be of sufficient duration to accomplish compaction without causing segregation .
Have at least one additional stand-by vibrating unit available for all individual pours in excess of 10 cubic yards .
604.17 549 E. Joints Do not produce a featheredge at construction joints .
Do not construct transverse or longitudinal joints through spans , unless otherwise specified .
Placement of bridge deck concrete between specified transverse construction joints shall be continuous unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer .
If the Contractor fails to maintain a rate of placement of 20 feet per hour in the longitudinal direction as specified in 604.22 , or if , in the Engineer ’ s judgment , placement is interrupted unduly because of failure or repositioning of equipment or any other cause , the Engineer may direct that all placement be stopped and a transverse construction joint be formed in the deck as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer .
Clean layers completing a day ’ s work , or placed just before temporarily discontinuing operations , of all laitance or other objectionable material as soon as the surface has become sufficiently firm to retain its form .
To construct box culverts 6 feet or less in height , the Contractor may construct the side walls and top slab as a monolith .
When using this method of construction , construct any necessary construction joints vertical and at right angles to the axis of the culvert .
To construct box culverts more than 6 feet in height , place the concrete in the walls and allow to set at least 4 hours before constructing the top slab .
Leave appropriate keys in the side walls for anchoring the top slabs .
Unless otherwise shown on the Plans , transverse contraction joints in box culverts shall be plain butt joints and longitudinal reinforcement shall not extend across the joint .
Space contraction joints at intervals of 30 to 40 feet .
Predetermine the location of joints , and when practicable , place them at changes in the box section .

Place concrete for seals only in still water , and ensure that the cofferdams or cribs meet the requirements specified in 204.09 .
Regulate the method of depositing concrete to maintain the surface of the concrete as nearly horizontal as practicable throughout the operation .
Place the concrete in a compact mass in its final position using a tremie , unless otherwise approved by the Engineer .
Do not disturb the concrete after depositing , and do not expose it to the action of water before final setting .
Obtain cores for each seal footing .
However , the Engineer will waive the inspection and coring of the seal footing if the seal footing is founded on piles and the encased piling projects above the seal footing and embeds into the structural footing a minimum length as shown on the Plans .
Obtain four cores , size N , as described by the Diamond Core Drill Association , or larger , representing 80 % of the depth of the seal footing as directed by the Engineer unless otherwise noted on the Plans .
Should the cores or other inspection indicate an inferior seal , perform corrective measures at no cost to the Department .
Unless otherwise noted , consider the costs for coring the seal to be incidental to other work items .
Mix all concrete deposited under water in the proportions designated for Class S concrete .
No additional compensation will be allowed for the additional cement .
Regulate the consistency of concrete to prevent segregation of material during placement .
Place underwater concrete continuously until the work is completed .
The tremie shall consist of a metal tube and suitable hopper of sufficient strength to withstand the stresses to which it is subjected .
The tube shall have a minimum inside diameter of not less than 10 inches , and shall be 604.19 551 constructed in sections having flanged couplings fitted with gaskets .
Support the tremie so as to allow free movement of the discharge end over the entire top surface of the work and to allow the tremie to be rapidly lowered when necessary to reduce or stop the flow of concrete .
Equip the lower or discharge end of the tremie with a suitable valve or device that shall be tightly closed while the tremie is being charged and lowered into position , and that can be fully opened in the lower position .
Keep the discharge end closed until the tube is filled with concrete to prevent water from entering .
Induce concrete flow by raising the tremie , but always keep the discharge end in the deposited concrete .
After removal of cofferdam sheeting , provide an underwater diver and camera to perform a tactile inspection of the concrete seal exposed faces and provide a video to document the condition of the exposed seal footing surfaces .
604.19 Removal of Forms and Falsework The Contractor may remove forms for ornamental work , railings , parapets , columns , and vertical surfaces that do not carry loads within 12 to 48 hours , unless otherwise directed by the Engineer .
In cold , damp , or freezing weather , all vertical forms shall remain in place until the concrete has set sufficiently to withstand damage when the forms are removed .
When removing forms , take care so as not to mar the concrete surface or to subject it to any undue pressure .
Remove or cut , as specified in 604.05.C , projecting wires or other metal devices used for holding forms in place and that pass through the body of the concrete .
Fill the holes or depressions thus made , and all other holes , depressions , and small voids that show upon the removal of the forms , with cement mortar mixed in the same proportions as that used in the body of the concrete being repaired .
The Contractor may release and remove falsework and supports under concrete in structures when : 1 .
Representative specimens of the concrete , cured by the methods and in the manner of the concrete that the test specimens represent is cured , attain a compressive strength of 3,000 pounds per square inch , and 604.20 552 2 .
The concrete has been in place a minimum of 7 days , not counting days of 24 hours each in which the temperature falls below 40 °F , or 21 calendar days , whichever occurs first .
After the above conditions have been met , the Contractor may proceed with placing further concrete pours or erecting precast or fabricated members .
Allow other loadings as specified in 604.28 .
For continuous concrete girder or slab units , do not release or remove the falsework and supports from any span in the continuous unit until the concrete in all spans has been placed a sufficient length of time to meet all requirements for the removal of falsework and supports specified above .
604.20 Defective Concrete Remove and replace defective concrete upon discovery .
If the surface of the concrete is bulged , uneven or has honeycombing that can not be repaired satisfactorily , remove and replace the entire section or unit .
The extent of the removal shall be as determined by the Engineer .
Concrete having an acceptance compressive strength less than the minimum specified shall be removed , disposed of , and replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the Department , unless specifically authorized by the Engineer , in writing , to be included in the permanent work .
Remove and dispose of nonconforming concrete in a manner that will not damage existing construction or other facilities and property .
The Engineer may allow concrete that fails to meet the strength specified to remain in the permanent construction , provided the durability is acceptable ; but the Department will pay for this concrete at a reduced price .
The Department will adjust the bid price for concrete that fails to meet the specified strength , but is considered structurally adequate for inclusion in the permanent construction , in accordance with 604.31 .
The Department will base any downward adjustment in bid price due to low strength concrete on the acceptance compressive strength of record for the concrete , as determined in accordance with 604.15 .
604.21 Finishing Concrete Surfaces Unless otherwise authorized , finish the surface of the concrete immediately after removing forms .
Give all concrete surfaces a Class I finish .
604.21 553 Give the following surfaces of all structures a Class II or Applied Texture Finish : roadway face and top of curbs , vertical outside face of curb overhang or sidewalks slab , bottom surface of slab overhang , bridge railings , barrier railings , all vertical surfaces of the superstructure of dual bridges exposed to view from either structure , and all surfaces of retaining walls , wing walls , and end walls that are visible from passing vehicles .

Do not combine the Class II and Applied Texture Finish .
If the Plans show an Applied Texture Finish , do not use a Class II finish .
The Plans may show other finish classes for designated surfaces .
A .
Class I , Ordinary Surface Finish Begin finishing as soon as forms are removed .
Remove all fins and irregular projections from surfaces that are to be exposed or waterproofed .
On all surfaces , ensure that the cavities produced by form ties and all other holes , honeycomb spots , broken corners or edges , and other defects , are thoroughly cleaned , saturated with water , and carefully pointed and trued with a mortar of cement and fine aggregate mixed in the proportions used in the class of the concrete being finished .
Mortar used in pointing shall not be more than 30 minutes old .
Leave all construction and expansion joints in the completed work carefully tooled and free of all mortar and concrete .
Leave the joint filler exposed for its full length with clean and true edges .
On all surfaces that can not be repaired to the Engineer ’ s satisfaction , rub as specified for a Class II finish .
604.21 554 B .
Class II , Rubbed Finish Complete a Class I finish as specified in 604.21.A .
Saturate the concrete with water .
Ensure that sufficient time has elapsed before the wetting down to allow the mortar used in the pointing to thoroughly set .
Rub the surfaces to be finished with a wetted wooden block or a medium coarse carborundum stone .
Do not use the carborundum stone until the concrete has hardened to the state where the sand will grind , rather than ravel or roll .
Continue rubbing until all form marks , projections , and irregularities have been removed , all voids filled , and a uniform surface has been obtained .
Leave the paste produced by this rubbing in place .
The Engineer will not allow a brush finish or painting with grout .
After all concrete above the surface being finished has been cast , obtain the final finish by rubbing with a fine carborundum stone and water .
Continue this rubbing until the entire surface is of a smooth texture and uniform color .
After the final rubbing is completed and the surface has dried , rub it with burlap to remove loose powder and ensure it is free from all unsound patches , paste , powder , and objectionable marks .
C. Class III , Float Finish For unformed surfaces , except slab surfaces for pavements or bases , achieve a Class III finish by placing an excess of material in the form and removing or striking off the excess with a template , forcing the coarse aggregate below the mortar surface .
Avoid creating concave surfaces .
After the concrete has been struck off , thoroughly work the surface and float with a suitable floating-tool of wood , canvas , or cork .
Before the finish has set , remove the surface cement film with a fine brush to produce a fine-grained , smooth but sanded texture .
D. Applied Texture Finish To prepare the surface for a textured finish , first provide a Class 1 Ordinary Surface Finish as specified in 604.21.A .
Allow the concrete to set for a minimum of 28 days to allow for ample cure time and weathering of curing compounds before applying the textured finish .
Pressure wash all surfaces just before application .
Remove from surfaces to be coated all efflorescence , flaking , coating , rust , dirt , oil , and other foreign substances .
Apply coatings only to surfaces that are 604.22 555 free of surface moisture as determined by sight and touch .
Shield and mask surfaces that are not to receive a Coated Finish .
Vee out cracks over 1/8 inch wide and fill with an approved product from the Department ’ s QPL 13-Section B.5.Structural Materials and Components .

Apply the textured finish in the number of coats as recommended by the manufacturer and as posted on the Department ’ s Qualified Products List to achieve a total application rate of 1 gallon per 45 square feet .
If using a two-coat system , apply a base coat similar in color to Mountain Gray , Federal Specification No .
36440 , when the final coat is White , Federal Specification No .
37886 .
When the final coat is similar in color to Mountain Gray , Federal Specification No .
36440 , use a base coat of White , Federal Specification No .
37886 .
Provide advance notice to the Engineer of the date ( s ) and time ( s ) the texture coating is to be applied .
Apply the textured finish with rollers or brushes so as to provide a consistent and uniform coverage .
As an alternative , the Contractor may spray the textured finish if using a containment system meeting the Engineer ’ s approval .
Regardless of the method of application , prevent drippings and overspray from the texturing process or otherwise contain in a manner that will not contaminate the environment .

604.22 Finishing Slab Surfaces for Pavements or Bases Use approved mechanical finishing machines to finish bridge floors or top slabs of structures serving as finished pavements or bases .
In extreme cases where mechanical finishing machines can not be used , such as narrow 604.22 556 widths due to phase construction , the Engineer may allow hand finishing or other methods .
Mechanical finishing machines shall be approved power driven machines , traveling on rails adjusted to conform to the profile of the roadway .
Equip the machines with oscillating or vibrating transverse or longitudinal screeds that may be adjusted to conform to the profile or the required cross-section of the roadway .
The screed shall have sufficient strength to retain their shape after adjustment .
Pass over each area of the bridge floor with the finishing machine as many times as necessary to obtain the required profile and cross-section .
When using longitudinal screeds , comply with the following restrictions : 1 .
The span length of the slab section to be poured shall be 70 feet or less .
2 .
Place sufficient concrete ahead of the strike-off to fully load the beam or girder prior to strike-off .
3 .
Control the rate of placement to ensure that the concrete will not take its initial set before the entire placement is complete .
4 .
The slab to be poured shall be in a tangent section .
5 .
Assume responsibility for damage to the structure caused by using this method .
Do not change the sequence of construction , as shown on the Plans , without the Engineer ’ s written approval .
When using the hand method , strike off the bridge floors or slabs with a screed that is parallel to the centerline of the roadway resting on bulkheads or screed strips cut or set to the required cross-section of the roadway .
This screed shall have sufficient strength to retain its shape and a cutting edge that may be adjusted to conform to the profile of the roadway .
Screeds shall be of sufficient length to finish the full length of spans 40 feet or less in length .
Finish spans over 40 feet in length in two or more sections , but no section shall be less than 20 feet in length .
Set screed strips or headers to the specified grades , and check and adjust as necessary before the final screeding operation .
Work the screed back and forth over the surface until the proper profile and cross-section is obtained .
Maintain a minimum placement rate of 20 feet of deck per hour when placing concrete in a longitudinal direction .
604.22 557 For bases , finish the surface by grooving lightly with a wire broom at an angle of 60 degrees with the centerline .
Begin all strokes at the center and end at the edge .
Finish and texture the surface of bridge approach slabs , bridge decks , and top slabs of other structures serving as roadway pavements by Method ( 3 ) below , except Method ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) may be used where shown on the Plans and/or where the design speed of the roadway on which the structure is located is less than 40 miles per hour .
1 .
Finish the surface by dragging a seamless strip of damp burlap over the full width of the surface .
Use a burlap drag consisting of sufficient layers of burlap to slightly groove the surface , and move it forward with a minimum bow of the lead edge .
Keep the drag damp , clean , and free of particles of hardened concrete .
When allowed by the Engineer , the Contractor may use a light broom or brush herringbone finish that leaves a texture similar to that obtained by the burlap drag .
2 .
Finish the surface with a burlap drag as noted in ( 1 ) above .
Then , at an appropriate time during the stiffening of the concrete , form transverse grooves in the surface so that in the hardened concrete the grooves will be between 0.09 and 0.13 inches in width ; between 0.12 and 0.19 inches in depth ; and spaced at random intervals between 0.3 and 1.0 inches .
The grooves shall be relatively smooth and uniform .
Form the grooves without tearing the surface or bringing pieces of coarse aggregate to the surface , and to drain transversely .
3 .
Finish the surface with a burlap drag as noted in ( 1 ) above .
Then , after allowing the concrete to cure as specified in 604.23 and to harden sufficiently to support the necessary equipment , groove the surface transversely using a mechanical saw device that will leave grooves 0.125 inches wide , 0.125 inches deep , and randomly spaced from 0.75 to 1.125 inches apart center to center .
Perform any corrective grinding for smoothness before transverse grinding , otherwise it will be necessary to re-groove .
Establish positive means for removing grooving residue as specified in 604.27.C .
Terminate the grooves formed by Method ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) above approximately 12 inches from curbs , parapets , barrier walls , and other vertical walls .
604.23 558 Include all costs for finishing and texturing in the unit price bid for the concrete being placed .
As soon as the surface has set sufficiently to withstand damage when walking on it , and not later than the morning following the placing of the concrete , apply a 12-foot straightedge and mark all variations exceeding 1/8 inch .
Correct and seal such variations in the same manner as specified in 604.27.C .
604.23 Curing Concrete Cure all concrete surfaces as specified below , except those surfaces protected by forms that remain in place 7 days or longer as specified in 604.19 .
Use curing materials that meet the requirements of 913 .
Begin curing on unformed surfaces immediately after the water sheen disappears and the surface finish is applied .
On formed surfaces , begin curing immediately after removing forms .
When the temperature is expected to fall below 35 °F , protect the concrete as specified in 604.24 .
Cure bridge decks and the top slabs of other structures located above the roadway subgrade elevation by using both the Membrane-Forming Compound Method and the Water Method .
Use new burlap for each pour , except burlap may be reused on the same project if it is undamaged and deemed acceptable by the Engineer .
The Contractor may cure all other concrete surfaces by either of the following methods .
A. Membrane-Forming Compound Method Give all surfaces the required surface finish , and keep it moist before applying the curing compound .
Apply the burlap drag finish on bridge decks , and on the top slabs of other structures that also serve as the roadway surface , as soon as practicable after screeding the surface , and then immediately apply the membrane curing compound .
Apply the curing compound at the manufacturer ’ s recommended rate .
Apply the curing compound under pressure .
Only use hand sprays in areas that are inaccessible to pressure equipment .
At the time of application of the curing compound , the concrete shall be thoroughly moist but without surface water .
At the time of use , ensure that the compound is in a thoroughly mixed condition with the pigment or dye uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle .
If the application of the compound results in a streaked or 604.24 559 blotchy appearance , take corrective action at once to obtain a well- dispersed mixture of uniform appearance .
For concrete surfaces that are not protected by burlap curing covers , use other means to protect against marring for a period of 5 days from the date of application .
Immediately replace membrane coating marred within the 5-day period on an otherwise unprotected surface .
B .
Water Method As soon as possible after applying curing compound to bridge decks and to other top slabs located above subgrade elevation , apply damp burlap , or other sheet type materials meeting the performance requirements of AASHTO M 171 and approved by the Department , from a work bridge , taking care not to mar the surface of the deck .
Immediately cover all other concrete slabs with materials suitable for use with the water cure .
After placing the protective cover , immediately apply a mist spray and keep the cover thoroughly wet with a continuously fed soaker hose system for 120 hours .
Keep all surfaces other than slabs protected from the sun and wet for a period of at least 72 hours from the beginning of the initial curing period .
For finishing , the Contractor may temporarily remove the covering from curbs , walls , handrails and other surfaces requiring a Class II finish , but shall restore the covering as soon as possible .
604.24 Protection of Concrete in Cold Weather If , after the concrete has been placed , the ambient temperature is expected to drop below 35 °F , provide insulation blankets , sufficient canvas , and framework , or other types of housing , to enclose and protect the structure in such a way that the air surrounding the fresh concrete can be maintained at a temperature of at least 45 °F and the surface temperature of the concrete will not exceed 80 °F .
Maintain the above conditions for a period of 120 hours after the concrete is placed .
Furnish a maximum-minimum thermometer to the Engineer for temperature documentation .

COMPENSATION 604.30 Method of Measurement A .
Concrete for Structures The Department will measure concrete for concrete structures , unless otherwise specified , by the cubic yard for payment purposes .
The volume will be computed from the dimensions shown on the Plans or directed in writing by the Engineer , except for the concrete fillet above fabricated bridge girders .
This fillet , as shown on the Plans , is intended to allow for adjustment due to the imprecise methods of predicting camber development of structural members .
At the time of construction , the fillet actually used to compensate for grade changes due to camber development , super-elevation , or other factors beyond 604.30 565 the Contractor ’ s control will be field measured for payment by profiling of the bridge members .
The Department will make no allowances for : 1 .
Furnishing the material and constructing drainage openings and weep holes as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer , provided such openings are 6 inches in diameter or less , except that no deduction will be made for such openings in the computation of concrete quantities .
Allowance will be made for other openings as indicated .
2 .
Additional cement used in depositing concrete under water ; for use of chemical additives , for fillers , sealers , and tar paper used in expansion joints ; for dowels or other materials used in bonding construction joints ; for waterstops ; and for painting metals .
3 .
Concrete placed below the foundation elevation shown on the Plans , unless directed by the Engineer .
When approved by the Engineer , the Department will measure concrete used for leveling structure footings by the cubic yard using the average end area method or other approved methods .
Unless otherwise indicated , the Department will deduct the volume of concrete displaced by pile heads .
The Department will make no additional compensation for high early strength concrete substituted by the Contractor for other classes of concrete .
The unit price for the class of concrete for which the substitution was made shall be full compensation for the concrete .
The Department will measure by the square yard any hydro-blasting of the bridge deck performed before placing a bridge deck overlay .
B .
Structure Excavation and Foundation Preparation The Department will measure and pay for Structure Excavation , Foundation Preparation and Backfill in accordance with 204 , except when the Plans indicate that no payment will be made for excavation and foundation preparation , then the Department will not measure excavation and will consider it incidental to other items of construction .
604.30 566 When , under 204.10.A , the Contractor places a foundation seal that is not included in the Plans , the Department will not measure and pay for furnishing the concrete and placing the seal , unless the following requirements and conditions are complied with before placing the foundation seal : 1 .
Cofferdams in which seals are requested shall have been constructed in strict compliance with 204.09 .
2 .
After investigation , the Engineer determines that conditions have been encountered that make it impracticable to de-water the foundation before placing the footing .
3 .
The Contractor requests and receives approval for the construction of the seal in writing .
4 .
The Department and the Contractor execute a Supplemental Agreement to establish a unit price per cubic yard and the method of measurement for the concrete to be used in the seal .
When the above conditions have been met , the Department will measure and pay for the Concrete Foundation Seal in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Agreement .
C. Reinforcement The Department will measure and pay for steel bar reinforcement used in concrete structures , unless otherwise specified , by the pound , as computed from the dimensions shown on the Plans , or directed in writing by the Engineer , and the weights specified in Tables 604.30-1 and 604.30-2 .
604.31 567 Table 604.30-1 : Steel Bar Reinforcement Bar Designation No .
Weight ( pounds per foot ) 3 0.376 4 0.668 5 1.043 6 1.502 7 2.044 8 2.670 9 3.400 10 4.303 11 5.313 Table 604.30-2 : Large Bar Sizes Bar Designation No .
Weight ( pounds per foot ) 14S 7.650 18S 13.600 The bar numbers designate the number of 1/8 of an inch increments in the nominal diameter of the bars .
The nominal diameter of a deformed bar is equivalent to the diameter of a plain bar having the same weight per foot as the deformed bar .
The Department will make no allowance for any device for splicing , clamping , tying , or positioning the reinforcement .
D. Applied Texture Finish The Department will measure Applied Texture Finish by the square yard of concrete surface treated , as determined in accordance with 109 .
604.31 Basis of Payment The Department will pay for accepted quantities at the contract prices as follows : 604.31 568 Item Pay Unit Class A Concrete ( Description ) Cubic Yard Class D Concrete ( Description ) Cubic Yard Class L Concrete ( Description ) Cubic Yard Class S Concrete ( Description ) Cubic Yard Steel Bar Reinforcement Pound Epoxy Coated Reinforcing Pound Scarifying Square Yard Applied Texture Finish Square Yard Hydro-demolition Square Yard The Department will pay for the concrete fillet above fabricated bridge girders as bridge deck concrete with the quantities based on the fillet required for a conventional deck forming system and measured as specified in 604.30.A .
The Department will not pay for increases in the fillet depth needed to accommodate the Contractor ’ s chosen deck forming system ( e.g .
precast deck panels ) , and will consider this increase to be incidental to other items bid .
The Department will pay for accepted quantities of leveling concrete at 40 % of the price bid for the concrete used in the footing .
If the Contractor does not meet the surface rideability requirements specified 604.27 , the Department will make deductions in monies due to the Contractor on a lump sum basis .
When field conditions result in the construction of a different type of box culvert or box bridge from that shown on the Plans ( box type to slab type or vice versa ) , the Department will increase the respective bid price per cubic yard for Class A concrete by 15 % for constructing a slab type instead of box type and will decrease the bid price by 13 % for constructing box type instead of slab type .
The Department will not adjust the Steel Bar Reinforcement unit bid price for the change in box culvert or box bridge type .
Where concrete does not meet the specified strength but is allowed to be included in the permanent construction as specified in 604.20 , or tardy acceptance cylinders or cores fail to meet the strengths specified in 604.15 , the Department will use the following equation to determine percent payment of contract bid price .
PP = 100 − ( 3 × Ds ) 604.31 569 Where , PP = Percent Payment Ds = Percent Below Specified Strength Ds = � ( Specified Strength − Actual Strength ) Specified Strength � × 100 The Department will base the percent payment on the unit price of the item as bid , i.e. , volume [ cubic yards ] , length [ feet ] , each , or other designated bid unit .
Payment of the calculated percentage includes cost of incidental items such as reinforcing steel when included in the price bid for the item .
Defective concrete greater than 25 % below specified strength may remain in place at no cost to the Department if approved by the Department of Structures , or the Contractor may remove and replace the defective concrete .

Spread bitumen , except primer coats , by mopping or brushing on the surface to be waterproofed .
The Contractor may spray bitumen for primer coats .
Mopping shall leave the surface completely covered , and where applied on fabric , it shall completely cover each layer so that the weave will be concealed and the layers of the fabric entirely separated .
Spread primer uniformly over the surface at the rate of not less than 0.2 gallons per square yard , and allow it to cure thoroughly before applying the subsequent coats of hot bitumen .
Uniformly apply the hot bitumen coats and coating between fabric .
Use at least 0.25 gallons per square yard in each coating or between layers of fabric on horizontal surfaces and at least 0.30 gallons per square yard on vertical surfaces .
Carry all waterproofing material continuously across expansion joints .
For bitumen that is to be applied hot , stir or otherwise agitate it to secure uniform heating and to avoid local overheating .
Allow all surfaces that have been waterproofed with bituminous materials to thoroughly cure before backfilling or placing other material against them .
Apply hot bitumen at temperatures ranging from 250 °F to 325 °F .
Apply the first layer of fabric as follows : 1 .
At the place of beginning waterproofing , and upon the prime coat , apply hot bitumen to a section 2 inches wider than the strip of fabric to be applied and for the full length of the section .
605.06 573 2 .
Then roll and press the strip of fabric on this area while the bitumen is hot .
3 .
On 2 inches of this strip of fabric and an area of the adjoining surface equal to 2 inches wider than a strip of fabric , apply a coating of hot bitumen , and roll and press a strip of fabric , full width , on it , as required for the first strip .
4 .
Thereafter , lay full widths of fabric as specified for the first strip , and in such manner that each strip will lap the preceding strip by 2 inches .
Ensure that side laps are not less than 2 inches and end laps not less than 12 inches .
Apply the second and third layers of fabric in the same manner as the first layer , but ensure that the laps of the layers do not come directly over the laps of either of the other layers .
Completely cover the third layer of fabric with a coat of hot bitumen .
When placing on vertical or inclined surfaces , allow the bitumen between two layers of fabric to cool before placing the next layer of fabric .
When placing on horizontal surfaces , the Contractor may apply one layer immediately following the preceding layer , while taking care not to disturb the preceding layer .
Place each strip of fabric without folds or creases , and eliminate all air bubbles and pockets .
B .
Class II Place the asphaltic materials and asphalt saturated fabric for Class II waterproofing as specified above for Class I Waterproofing .
After the final coating of bitumen is applied to the fabric , and while it is hot , place the asphalt plank upon the bitumen and lay tightly , with the end joints broken in each layer of plank .
After the planks are laid , fill all open cracks with hot asphalt , and apply hot asphalt to the outer surface of the planks .
The finished surface shall be smooth and true to line and grade .
605.07 574 605.07 Edges At the edge of all surfaces , or where surfaces are punctured by drains , pipes , or other openings , prevent water from getting between the waterproofing and the surface waterproofed .

606.07 581 When handling or hauling precast concrete piles , support them at the points shown on the Plans , or , if not so shown , support the piles at the quarter points .
The Engineer will make a final inspection as to condition after delivery to the site .
606.07 Cast-in-Place Concrete Piles A .
General Construct cast-in-place concrete piles of the design shown on the Plans and that consist of concrete cast in drilled holes or in steel shells or pipes driven to the required bearing .
Use Class A concrete meeting 604 .
Remove all water from the inside of the drilled holes or the steel shells or pipes before placing the concrete .
B. Drilled Holes Dry drill all holes for cast-in-place piles to the tip elevations shown on the Plans .
The Engineer will examine all holes for straightness and will reject holes that on visual inspection from the top show less than half of the diameter of the hole at the bottom .
Provide and place suitable casings when required to prevent caving of the hole before concrete is placed .
After drilling operations have been completed , but before placing concrete , remove all loose material at the bottom of the hole .
Do not use water for drilling operations or for any other purpose that may cause it to enter the hole .
Take all necessary action to prevent surface water from entering the hole .
C. Casing If using casing in drilling operations , remove it from the hole as concrete is placed .
Maintain the bottom of the casing not more than 5 feet nor less than 1 foot below the top of the concrete during withdrawal and placing operations , unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer .
Prevent separation of the concrete during withdrawal operations by hammering or otherwise vibrating the casing .
606.08 582 D. Steel Shells and Pipes Inspect the inside of shells and pipes as specified in 606.15 .
Remove all loose material before placing concrete .
Place the concrete in one continuous operation from tip to cutoff elevation and so as to avoid segregation .
Consolidate the concrete in the upper 25 feet of shell or pipe piles by using vibrators .
Do not fill any shell or pipe with concrete until all adjacent shells , pipes , or piles within a radius of 5 feet or 4-1/2 times the average pile diameter , whichever is greater , have been driven to the required resistance .
After a shell or pipe has been filled with concrete , do not drive a shell , pipe , or pile within 20 feet of it until at least 7 days have elapsed .
606.08 Test Piles When called for in the Bid Schedule , furnish and drive test piles of the dimensions , at the locations , and to the minimum tip elevations , shown on the Plans or as designated by the Engineer .
When approved by the Engineer , the Contractor may drive test piles to be load tested through the existing overburden , without excavating to the bottom of the footing elevation and by predrilling when required by the Engineer , provided that the additional length of test pile necessary to obtain the requirements specified below is furnished at no additional cost to the Department .
Before driving any other test or foundation piles , excavate the ground at each test pile to the elevation of the bottom of the footing .
Drive test piles to be load tested full length or to the specified bearing indicated on the Plans as determined by the applicable specification equation in 606.14 , whichever occurs first .
Drive all other test piles full length or to 1.5 times the specified bearing indicated on the Plans , whichever occurs first .
However , the tip elevation for all piles shall be either a minimum of 10 feet below ground elevation or the minimum tip elevation when specified on the Plans .
If the test pile has been driven to 1.5 times the specified bearing but has not reached the minimum tip elevation , continue to drive the test pile until the required penetration is obtained or practical refusal occurs , whichever occurs first .
When the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding 606.08 583 practical pile refusal , use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .
Practical refusal shall be defined as 15 blows per inch for 2 consecutive inches of driving or when 2 times the minimum required bearing is achieved based on the last 6 inches of driving .
Use pile driving equipment capable of driving to 1.5 times the specified bearings indicated on the Plans at a driving rate not to exceed 15 blows per inch .
Perform a load test on one or more of the test piles as shown on the Plans or as designated by the Engineer .
From driving logs for test piles and hold- down piles , load tests , and other available subsoil information , the Engineer will determine the number and length of piles to be used and the minimum required bearing .
The Engineer may require a test pile to be left in place for use , cut off , spliced , or removed .
Load tests shall consist of a test load accomplished by loading weights on a platform or by jacking against hold-down piles with a suitable apparatus for accurately measuring the test load and the pile settlement under each increment of load .
The pile load test apparatus for applying loads and measuring movement shall meet the requirements of ASTM D1143 .
Apply the load so as not to exert any undue bending stresses or damage to the pile .
The loading and calibration system shall be capable of applying and recording loads up to 200 % of the pile bearing values shown on the Plans .
Materials used in performing load tests shall remain the property of the Contractor .
Unless otherwise shown on the Plans , wait a minimum of 3 days between installing the load test pile and starting the test .
The Engineer may direct that load tests be added , deleted , or repeated , and will make payment for such testing in accordance with 606.22 .
The Department based the number of load tests and test piles shown on the Plans on the assumption that the Contractor will drive all tests piles with the same pile driver as was used for the load test pile .
If choosing to drive some test piles with a different pile driver , furnish the necessary additional load tests at no additional cost to the Department .
After the Engineer establishes the number and length of piles to be used , the Contractor may drive regular piles with a different pile driver from that used for driving test piles , provided it notifies the Engineer of Structures before pile lengths are established and uses a pile driver that conforms to the specified requirements .
606.08 584 Before driving a pile to be load tested , submit to the Engineer written details outlining the method of applying , measuring , and recording test loads along with sufficient sketches to fully illustrate the method , procedure , and arrangements proposed .
For the jacks to be used in the tests , submit to the Engineer calibration certificates from a laboratory approved by the Engineer .
Ensure that the certificates are no more than 6 months old .
The following are the two methods for performing pile load tests .
Perform the quick load test unless directed otherwise on the Plans .
A .
Quick Load Test The full test load shall be 200 % of the pile load shown on the Plans .
Apply the load in approximately equal increments of 10 to 20 % of the pile load as shown on the Plans , and at intervals of 5 minutes throughout the load test .
Take and record readings of time , load , and movement immediately before and after applying each load .
Apply the load until either a plunging failure occurs or the full test load is reached .
Plunging failure occurs when continuous jacking is required to maintain the test load .
After the final holding time , or immediately after plunging failure occurs , remove the applied load in five approximately equal decrements with intervals of 5 minutes between decrements .
Take readings after removing each decrement and 5 minutes after the complete removal of the test load .
B .
Maintained Load Test The full test load shall be 150 % of the pile load as shown on the Plans .
Apply the test load in maximum increments of 25 % of the pile load as shown on the Plans and at time intervals such that the rate of settlement does not exceed 0.12 inch per hour per load increment for a minimum interval of 2 hours .
Take and record readings of time , load , and movement immediately before and after applying each load increment .
The failing load is defined as the minimum load that produces one of the following conditions : 1 .
Rate of settlement exceeding 0.12 inch per hour for a 2-hour period .
2 .
Settlement occurring during the last 12 hours of the full load test period .
3 .
Permanent net settlement after rebound in excess of 1/4 inch .
606.09 585 When failure occurs under condition 1 , decrease the applied load as necessary until the rate of settlement is within the allowable limits to establish the failing load .
Take a final reading 1 hour after complete removal of the load , and accurately record the failing load .
The Department will pay the full value of the unit price bid for load tests .
The Engineer will decide to what extent , if any , the test pile will be considered as contributing to the support of the structure .
Should failure not occur due to condition 1 , carry the load test to completion with the full test load remaining on the pile for 48 hours and then removed in six equal increments at 1-hour intervals with readings taken after the removal of each increment and 1 hour after the complete removal of the test load .
Although the terminology in this Subsection is related to driven piles , it shall also apply to cast-in-place piles if so designated on the Plans .
After performing the load tests shown on the Plans , the Contractor may choose to substitute piling of a different material or configuration from that shown on the Plans provided they meet the minimum design standards and specifications and are approved by the Engineer .
The required length of the substituted piling will be determined by additional load test ( s ) conducted at no cost to the Department .
The basis of payment for the piling shall be in accordance with 606.22 , except the total linear feet shall not exceed that established by load tests for the piles shown on the Plans .
When additional test piles that are load tested and deemed usable are made at plan location using the substituted material , the Department will make payment at the unit bid price for regular piling .
606.09 Calibration Tests When diesel or other types of hammers requiring calibration are to be used , calibrate the hammers by performing load tests , as directed by the Engineer , even if no load tests are called for in the Bid Schedule .
The Department will not require such calibrations if the hammer is to be used only for driving piles to rock or a fixed tip elevation , or when the hammer is of a type and model that has previously been calibrated by sources acceptable to the Engineer , for similar type , size , and length of pile , and foundation material .
606.10 586 606.10 Order Lists for Piles The Engineer will furnish the Contractor with an itemized list showing the number and length , as determined by tests , of all required piles , complete in place .
The Engineer will not prepare the list of piling for any portion of the foundation area until the required test data representative of that portion has been determined .
The Engineer will base the lengths given in the order list on the lengths that are assumed to remain in the completed structure .
Furnish the piles in accordance with the itemized list , except , at no additional cost to the Department , increase the lengths to provide for fresh heading and for such additional length as may be necessary to suit the Contractor ’ s method of operation .
If during pile driving , the conditions encountered require a change in lengths , make such changes by cutting off piling if it is too long , by furnishing new piling , or by splicing as specified in 606.16 if the piling is too short .
The Department will make no allowance for delays caused by the procedure of determining pile lengths .
606.11 Storage and Handling Store and handle piles so as to avoid damaging them and as follows : 1 .
Store steel piles above ground , and keep them free of dirt and grease and , insofar as practicable , corrosion .
2 .
To handle timber piles , do not use hooks , dogs , pike poles , or similar pointed tools , and take care to avoid breaking their surface .
3 .
Lift precast concrete piles by attaching a suitable bridle or sling to the pile at the points shown on the Plans .
606.12 Driving Piles Drive piles at the locations shown on the Plans or as directed in writing by the Engineer , and to within an allowed variation as to direction of pile of not more than 1/4 inch per foot of pile length , with a maximum variation at the head of the pile from the position shown on the Plans of not more than 3 inches .
To ensure proper positioning of each pile , use templates 606.12 587 constructed of heavy timbers or steel , which are accurately positioned , securely held in place , and approved by the Engineer .
When using water jets , ensure that the number of jets and the nozzle volume and pressure is sufficient to erode the material adjacent to the piling freely .
The pump shall have sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square inch at two 3/4-inch jet nozzles .
Before the required penetration is reached , shut off the jets and drive the piles by hammer to final penetration .
When preformed pile holes are used , construct them by drilling or driving and withdrawing a suitable punch or chisel at or near the locations of the piles .
If preformed pile holes are so oversized that the sides of a round pile or the corners of a square pile are not in contact with the soil , restore lateral stability by filling the space between the pile and the sides of the hole with approved clean sand , at no cost to the Department .
Terminate preformed holes before the required penetration is reached , and drive the pile by hammer to the final tip elevation to seat the pile and secure the minimum required bearing .
Except when the pile head is fitted into a steel head block , provide every timber pile with a metal collar or wire wrapping .
Protect the heads of all concrete piles , and the heads of all other piles when the nature of the driving is such that piles may be unduly damaged , with caps of approved design , having a plywood cushion next to the pile head and fitting into a casting , which , in turn , supports a hammer cushion made from durable , manufactured material .
Do not use wire rope and other materials of limited durability .
Use an approved pile cushion of sufficient thickness to prevent damage to the pile during driving .
Use a minimum initial dimension of 4-inch thick plywood pile cushion for concrete piles .
Replace the pile cushion before excessive compression ( more than 1/2 the original thickness ) , burning , or charring takes place .
During hard driving , several pile cushions may be necessary for a single pile .
Use a new pile cushion for each pile .
For special types of piling , provide driving heads , mandrels , or other devices in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s recommendations so that the pile may be driven without damage .
For steel piling , squarely cut the heads and provide a driving cap to align the axis of the pile with the axis of the hammer .
When shown on the Plans , cap steel piles with steel plates or other devices .
606.13 588 Use full length piles where practicable .
In exceptional circumstances , the Engineer may allow splicing of piles .
Splice as specified in 606.16 .
Install production piles full length , except terminate driving when practical refusal as defined in 606.08 has been reached .
If production piles do not achieve the minimum required bearing when driven full length , the Engineer will determine if additional piles are required .
The tip elevation for all production piles shall be equal to or below the minimum pile tip elevation shown on the Plans .
When the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding practical refusal , use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .
If piles are raised during driving of other piles , or by any other cause , drive them down again at no cost to the Department .
606.13 Bearing Value and Penetration When the Bid Schedule provides for load tests , the Engineer will determine the minimum number of hammer blows per unit of pile penetration needed to obtain the specified bearing value based on load tests performed as specified in 606.08 and 606.09 .
In the absence of load tests , the Engineer will determine the safe bearing value based on test pile data .
Each driven pile or shell shall have a minimum bearing value as shown on the Plans or as specified by the Engineer given the results of the load test or test pile data .
Drive piles with the same driving system ( fuel setting , hammer cushion , and pile cushion ) as the test piles , or the pile that was load tested .
Piles used to penetrate a very soft upper stratum overlying a hard stratum shall penetrate the hard material a sufficient distance to fix the pile rigidly .
606.14 Determination of Bearing Value In the absence of load tests , the Engineer will determine the safe bearing value by one of the following formulas : 1 .
Gravity Hammers : 𝑃 = 2𝑊𝐻 𝑆 + 1 606.14 589 2 .
Single Acting Steam or Air Hammers and Diesel Hammers with Unrestricted Rebound : 𝑃 = 2𝑊𝐻 𝑆 + 0.1 3 .
Double Acting Steam or Air Hammers : 𝑃 = 2𝐻 ( 𝑊 + 𝐴𝑝 ) 𝑆 + 0.1 4 .
Double Acting Steam or Air Hammers and Diesel Hammers Having Enclosed Rams : 𝑃 = 2𝐸 𝑆 + 0.1 Where : P = Safe load per pile in pounds ; W = Weight of the striking part of the hammer in pounds ; A = Area of piston in square inches ; p = Steam pressure in pounds per square inch at hammer ; H = Height of fall in feet for gravity , steam , and air hammers , and observed average height of fall , in feet , of blows used to determine penetration for diesel hammers with unrestricted rebound of ram ; S = Average penetration per blow in inches for the last 5 to 10 blows of a gravity hammer or the last 10 to 20 blows of a steam , air , or diesel hammer ; and E = Manufacturer ’ s rating for foot-pounds of energy developed by double acting steam or air hammers , and 90 % of the average equivalent energy in foot- pounds , as determined by a gauge attached to the pile hammer and recorded during the period when the average penetration per blow is recorded for diesel hammers having enclosed rams .
Hammers of this type shall be equipped with a gauge and applicable charts supplied that will evaluate the equivalent energy being produced under any driving condition .
The above formulas are applicable only when : 606.15 590 1 .
The hammer has a free fall ; 2 .
The head of the pile is free from broomed or crushed wood fiber or other serious impairment ; 3 .
The penetration is at a reasonably quick and uniform rate ; 4 .
There is no appreciable bounce after the blow ; 5 .
The weight of pile is no more than the weight of hammer used , if hammer is of the gravity type ; and 6 .
A follower is not used .
If there is an appreciable bounce , twice the height of bounce will be deducted from H to determine its value in the formula .
The bearing power , as determined by the appropriate formula in the list above , will be considered effective only when it is less than the crushing strength of the pile .
Other recognized formulas for determining pile-bearing power may be used if fully detailed in the Special Provisions .
When the safe bearing value of any pile is found by test or computation to be less than the design load , drive longer piles or additional piles as directed in writing by the Engineer .
606.15 Inspection of Shells for Cast-in-Place Piling After the shell has been driven , and the core withdrawn , obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of the shell before placing any concrete .
Remove and replace shells that have been improperly driven , do not hold their proper form and dimensions , or are broken or otherwise defective .
606.16 Extensions and Splices A .
Steel and Timber Piles Use full length steel or timber piles where practicable .
If splices can not be avoided , use a method of splicing as shown on the Plans .
Spliced piles shall have a full , true , and even bearing at the joint .
Do not splice timber piles in abutments .
606.17 591 B. Precast Concrete Piles Extend precast concrete piles by removing the concrete at the end of the pile and leaving the reinforcement steel exposed for a length of 30 diameters .
Securely brace the pile to prevent it from vibrating during the cutting or building up operation .
Remove the concrete to produce a face at right angles to the axis of the pile .
Securely fasten reinforcement similar to that used in the pile to the projecting steel .
Place the necessary forms to prevent leakage along the pile .
Immediately before placing concrete , clean the top of the pile of all loose particles , wet it thoroughly , and cover with a thin coating of cement grout .
Use Class P or high early strength concrete meeting the applicable requirements of 604 and 615.09 .
Extend precast prestressed concrete piling as shown on the Plans .
Use reinforcement similar to that used for precast concrete piling , Size 1 .
Remove forms as specified in 604.19 .
After the forms have been removed , give the concrete the required finish .
Do not construct caps to be supported by built-up precast concrete piles until test specimens representing the concrete in the buildups attain a compressive strength of at least 3,000 pounds per square inch .
606.17 Cutoffs and Treatment of Pile Heads Drive or cut the tops of all piles to a true plane at the elevation shown on the Plans , or established by the Engineer .
Saw timber piles that support timber caps to the plane of the superimposed cap , and ensure they fit snugly .
Treat untreated timber pile heads as specified in 601.07 before they are to receive caps .
After treatment , place a covering of 20-gauge galvanized iron on each timber pile and fold it down neatly over the side and fasten so as to shed water .
606.18 592 No treatment or covering of pile heads will be required if they are to be encased in concrete .
606.18 Conditioning of Treated Timber Piles after Driving Thoroughly treat all places where the surface of timber piles is broken as specified in 601.07 .
Treat bored holes and holes caused by withdrawing bolts and spikes as specified in 601.06.K .
606.19 Painting Steel Piles and Steel Shells Unless otherwise specified , paint steel piles or steel pile shells that extend above the ground or water surface .
Extend the paint from 2 feet below the low water or ground surface elevation to the top of the exposed steel .
Unless otherwise indicated , use painting System A , as specified in 603.06 , except apply the shop coat in the field .
Perform painting as specified in 603 .
606.20 Final Cleanup After driving and completing the piling , clean the piles of undue discoloration caused by construction operations .
Give those areas of concrete piles that will be exposed the applicable finish , as specified in 604.22 .
Perform final cleanup as specified in 104.10 .
COMPENSATION 606.21 Method of Measurement A .

CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 615.05 General Construct the substructure for the precast/prestressed structural concrete members as shown on the Plans and as specified in the applicable Sections of these Specifications .
Fabricate the panels in a PCI Category B3 certified plant .
Construct the precast/prestressed structural concrete members in an approved plant under plant control conditions , and place them upon the substructure to the established lines and grades as shown on the Plans .
Ensure that each plant has a quality control plan as specified in 604.03.B .
615.06 Forms Unless otherwise allowed , for external forms , provide metal forms that are mortar-tight and sufficiently rigid to prevent distortion due to pressure of the concrete and other stresses incident to the construction operations .
The forms shall be substantial and unyielding , and designed , set , and maintained so that the finished concrete will conform to the proper dimensions and contours .
Provide forms that are filleted at sharp corners and that have a bevel or draft in the case of projections to allow for easy removal .
Wooden bulkheads may be used .
Treat forms with oil immediately before placing the concrete .
Do not use any material that will adhere to or discolor the concrete .
Internal forms may be of cellular polystyrene , meeting the requirements specified in Table 615.06-1 , or reinforced cardboard .
615.07 641 Table 615.06-1 : Cellular Polystyrene Property Value Density ( ASTM D1622 ) 0.90 pounds per cubic foot Compressive Strength @ 10 % Deformation ( ASTM D1621 ) 10 psi minimum Absorption ( ASTM C272 ) 3 % ( vol . )
maximum Each individual form shall have a cross-sectional area , equal to the cross- sectional area of the beam void , and a minimum length of 5 feet .
When individual forms are constructed by gluing pieces together , use an approved glue .
The Engineer will reject forms that show signs of glued joint separations .
615.07 Stressing Requirements - General Calibrate all jacks , together with their gauges before using in the manufacture of prestressed members .
When required by the Department , perform calibrations using proving rings or other acceptable methods performed by an approved testing laboratory at the Contractor ’ s expense .
Have a calibration chart for each device readily available on site and also furnish such charts to the Department .
Recalibrate jacks and gauges at least once every 6 months .
Provide means for measuring the elongation of reinforcement to at least the nearest 1/16 inch .
For all methods of tensioning , determine the force in the tendons by monitoring either the applied force or the elongation , and then independently checking by measuring the other .
At the completion of tensioning operations , the two control measurements , force and elongation , shall agree within 5 % of the computed theoretical values .
If discrepancies exceed 5 % , suspend the tensioning operation and use qualified personnel to determine and evaluate the source of error before proceeding .
If the source of the discrepancy can not be determined , recalibrate the devices .
Additionally , ensure that the control measurements of force and elongation algebraically agree with each other within 5 % .
If the measurements do not agree within 5 % , the Contractor may add a load cell at the “ dead end , ” and if force measurements agree within 5 % between the gauge at the live end and the load cell at the dead end , the Department will waive the requirement for elongation agreement .
615.08 642 When taking elongation and gauge readings , include appropriate allowances for chuck seating , bed shortening under load , abutment rotation , thermal effects , gauge correction based on calibration data , friction , and any other compensation for the setup .
To measure the tensioning force , use one or more of the following methods : 1 .
Pressure gauges to measure force from the pressure applied to hydraulic jacks .
2 .
Dynamometers connected in tension into the tensioning system .
3 .
Load cells connected into the tensioning system so the action of the tensioning operation imparts a compressive force to the sensing element .
4 .
Digital readouts connected to a pressure transducer to measure force from the pressure applied to the hydraulic jack .
5 .
Force computed from the actual elongation of the strand based on its physical properties and compensation adjustments .
For pretensioned members , establish independent references adjacent to each anchorage to indicate any yielding or slippage that may occur between the time of initial stressing and final release of the cables .
Stressing of strands for pretensioned members or tendons for post-tensioned members may be from one end , unless otherwise indicated .
However , if there is a discrepancy of more than 5 % between stresses in the strand or tendon , as computed from the elongation measurement and those indicated by gauge readings , perform jacking from both ends .
615.08 Pretensioning Procedure Apply to each cable the amount of stress shown on the Plans .
Perform pretensioning by either the single strand or multi-strand jacking method .
When prestressing is performed by the multi-strand jacking method , bring the cables to a uniform initial tension of approximately 5,000 pounds before applying the full pretensioning stress .
Measure the initial tension of each cable by a dynamometer or other approved means .
615.09 643 After the initial tensioning , stress the cables until the required elongation and jacking pressure are attained and reconciled within the limits specified in 615.07 .
Tension the deflected pretensioned strands by either partially jacking at the end of the bed followed by raising or lowering the strands to their final position , or entirely by jacking , with the strands being held in their final position during the jacking operation .
Tension the deflected strands so that the final tension in all parts of the strand is uniform , and provide means to reduce frictional forces at the bend points to a minimum .
When strands are deflected after partial tensioning , raise or depress the strands simultaneously at all points or in an approved specific sequence .
Obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of strand splicing methods and devices .
When using single strand jacking , provide only one splice per strand .
When using multi-strand jacking , either splice all strands or no more than 10 % of the strands .
Spliced strands shall be similar in physical properties , from the same source , and shall have the same “ twist ” or lay .
Locate all splices outside of the prestressed units .
The Engineer may accept wire failures , provided not more than one wire in any strand is broken and the area of broken wires does not exceed 2 % of the total area of the strands .
After final stressing , all strands shall be positioned as shown on the Plans , and the stress in the strands shall be uniformly distributed throughout the bed length .
With the cables stressed in accordance with the Plan requirements and the foregoing Specifications , and with all other reinforcing in place , cast the members to the lengths specified .
Maintain cable stress between anchorages until the concrete reaches the compressive strength specified in 615.09 .
615.09 Proportioning and Mixing of Concrete Proportion Class P concrete as specified in Table 615.09-1 .

Before placing any concrete , clean the forms of construction debris and other extraneous matter .
Place and secure the reinforcing bars , of the size and type specified , as shown on the Plans .
2 .
Place concrete in the forms immediately after mixing .
Do not use any concrete that does not reach its final position in the forms within 30 minutes after adding the cement to the mix .
Place the concrete so as to prevent segregation of the materials and displacement of the reinforcement .
3 .
Use metal or metal-lined open troughs and chutes , and keep them clean and free from hardened concrete .
Discharge water used in flushing clear of the forms .
4 .
Keep the temperature of forms , headers , cables , reinforcing bars , or other steel that comes in contact with freshly placed concrete to below 110 °F during casting operation , except keep forms for deck panels below 90 °F .
5 .
Do not begin to place concrete if the ambient temperature is below 26 °F ; and if the ambient temperature falls below 26 °F during the placement of concrete , discontinue the placement as soon as practicable .
6 .
Do not begin placing concrete during precipitating weather ; and if precipitating weather occurs during the pouring operation , only leave the area where the concrete is being placed uncovered .
Limit this uncovered area to no more than 10 feet of bed length .
615.11 646 7 .
Do not deposit any concrete until the Engineer has inspected and approved the placement of the reinforcement , conduits , anchorages , and prestressing steel .
Clean all exposed steel of all concrete , other than light deposits of cement paste , immediately after placing and consolidation is completed .
B .

Apply vibration at the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited concrete .
The vibrators used may be internal or external or a combination of both .
Vibrate for a sufficient duration and intensity to compact the concrete thoroughly , but so as not to cause segregation .
Place concrete in the precast units in one continuous operation for each unit , except for the minimum delay required for installing voids .
Deposit and consolidate the concrete so that the concrete will be smooth and dense and free from honeycomb and pockets of segregated aggregates .
Give roadway surfaces a Class 3 finish as specified in 604.21.C .
615.11 Removing Forms , Finishing , and Curing A .
Removing Forms The Contractor may remove side forms as soon after 6 hours as their removal will not cause distortion of the hardened concrete .
Do not remove the members from the bottom forms until they have been stressed sufficiently to sustain all forces and bending moments that may be applied during handling .
B. Finishing Finish all formed surfaces of the bridge members as specified in 604.22 .
The Contractor may use other methods when approved by the Engineer .
Finish roadway surfaces of the members as specified in 604.21.C .
Transversely score the top surface of members that will not become a part of the roadway surface with a stiff wire brush , or by other approved methods .
After removing hold down devices from the bottom of the beams , coat the resulting holes with an approved bonding compound and plug with mortar .
615.11 647 C. Curing Cure the bridge members by the water method or by steam curing as specified below .
The Contractor may use other methods , provided the details of the proposed methods are submitted to the Department and approved .
1 .
Water Curing .
As soon as the concrete has hardened to a degree that the finish will not be harmed , perform water curing as follows : a .
Cover the member with a pre-dampened material suitable for use with the water cure .
b .
Keep continuously and thoroughly wet until the member has attained the strength required for stress transfer with a minimum curing time of 24 hours .
Do not cure using the water method when the ambient temperature is expected to drop below 45 °F .
2 .
Steam Curing .
Perform steam curing as follows : a .
After placing and vibrating the concrete , wait until the member attains initial set , 2 to 4 hours , or 4 to 6 hours if a set retarder has been used , before applying steam .
If the ambient air temperature is below 50 °F , apply enough steam during the delay period to hold the air surrounding the member at a minimum temperature of 50 °F and a maximum of 10 °F greater than the temperature of the concrete at placement .
b .
To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces during the delay period , cover members as soon as possible after casting or keep the exposed surfaces wet by fog spray or wet blankets .
c. Perform steam curing beneath suitable enclosures that will allow free circulation of steam about the sides , ends , and tops of members , and that will contain the live steam with a minimum moisture loss .
The Contractor may use tarpaulins or similar flexible covers , provided they are kept in good repair and secured in a manner that will prevent the loss of significant steam and moisture .
615.11 648 d. Steam at the jets shall be low pressure and in a saturated condition .
Steam jets shall not impinge directly on the concrete , test cylinders , or forms .
During application of the steam , the temperature rise within the enclosure shall not exceed 50 °F per hour .
The curing temperature throughout the enclosure shall be not less than 90 °F nor more than 160 °F , and the relative humidity shall be not less than 95 % .
The difference in the temperature adjacent to the concrete at different locations within the enclosure shall not exceed 20 °F at any time .
Continue steam curing until the concrete has reached the required transfer strength .
In discontinuing the steam , do not reduce the temperature within the enclosure more than 50 °F per hour until the temperature inside is within 10 °F of the temperature outside .
The minimum time from the end of placement and finishing operations to the removal of required covers shall not be less than 12 hours .
e. When curing has been done at elevated temperatures , begin to transfer the prestressing load after releasing the forms and discontinuing the steam and while the concrete is still hot in order to prevent cooling shrinking and cracking .
If so directed by the Engineer , cover members or otherwise protect them so as to cool the concrete slowly after release in order to prevent thermal shock and the evaporation of moisture in the members .
f. Provide temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous permanent record of the curing temperature .
Provide a minimum of one recording device per 200 feet of continuous bed length with a minimum of two devices per bed .
g. Leave side forms in place a minimum of 6 hours after the concrete is cast or until the concrete has set sufficiently to withstand damage when the forms are removed .
When the side forms are removed during the curing cycle , only remove the minimum area of the curing enclosure that is necessary to remove each individual form section area in the enclosure .
Immediately close the open area in the enclosure as each form section is removed .
615.12 649 h. When the temperature is not expected to rise above 32 °F , protect the beams from freezing temperatures until the design strength is reached .
615.12 Post-Tensioning Procedure When post-tensioning , set the anchor plates normal in all directions to the axis of the steel .
In all stressing operations , keep the stressing forces symmetrical about the vertical axis of the member .
Do not begin tensioning until the concrete has reached a compressive strength of at least 3,500 pounds per square inch , unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
The amount of tensioning to be retained in each post-tensioned unit after anchorage shall be as shown on the Plans .
Apply a slight overstress , as determined in the field , to overcome friction between steel and enclosure and to allow for relaxation of the anchorage .
Tension the units until the required elongations and jacking pressures are attained and reconciled within the limits specified in 615.07 , with such overstress as approved by the Engineer for anchorage relaxation .
Then allow the male anchorage element to be driven home by the jack action .
Conduct the tensioning process so that the tension being applied and the elongation of the prestressing elements may be measured at all times .
Determine the friction loss in the element , i.e. , the difference between the tension at the jack and the minimum tension , in accordance with the current edition of AASHTO Standard Specification for Highway Bridges .
615.13 Combined Prestressing and Post-tensioning If the members are manufactured with part of the reinforcement pre- tensioned and part post-tensioned , comply with the applicable portions of the requirements specified above for each part .
615.14 Transfer of Stress Do not transfer the stress to the bridge members until the test specimens indicate that the concrete has reached a compressive strength of at least 4,000 pounds per square inch , unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
Before transferring any stress to the bridge members , obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of the pattern and schedule for releasing the strands .
Strip or 615.15 650 loosen forms that tend to restrict the horizontal or vertical movement of the member prior to stress transfer .
Transfer stress by either the multiple strand release method or the single strand release method .
When the multiple strand method of release is used , gradually and simultaneously release either a symmetrical group of strands or all of the strands .
Remove the load on the strands from the anchorage and place on the jacking system .
Gradually release the jack or jacks until the strands are relaxed .
When the single strand release method is used , heat strands with a low oxygen flame played along the strand for a minimum of 3 inches until the metal gradually loses its strength and allows the strand to slowly pull itself apart .
Apply heat at such a rate that failure of the first wire in each strand will not occur until at least 5 seconds after heat is first applied .
Release the strands in the sequence of the approved pattern and schedule of release .
615.15 Handling and Installation Prepare an erection plan in accordance with 602.42 and with the requirements of this Subsection .
The Contractor may handle all members immediately after completion of stressing .
If the stressing is not done in a continuous operation , do not handle members before they are sufficiently stressed , as determined by the Engineer , to sustain all forces and bending moments due to handling .
When handling members , maintain them in an upright position at all times and pick them up from the points designated on the Plans .
The Contractor may incorporate the members into the bridge structure at any time after completion of stressing and grouting , provided representative test specimens indicate that the concrete in the members has attained the design strength specified in 615.09 , unless a minimum beam age is shown on the Plans .
Do not ship any beams from the fabrication plant for incorporation into a structure until the Department has formally accepted the beams in accordance with Departmental procedures .
615.16 651 Erect all prestressed beam members and establish the grade of the roadway on the bridge before starting forming for the bridge deck , unless otherwise shown on the Plans or approved by the Engineer .
If the Contractor wishes to start forming for the bridge deck before all beams have been erected , and the Plans do not preclude this practice , first obtain written approval from the Structures Division before constructing any forms .
615.16 Grouting Equip conduit , used for installing the bars or cables through post-tensioned members , with approved grouting vents .
After completion of stressing , grout the space between sides of bar or cable and sides of conduit as specified in 616.09 .

619.06 674 Construct the overlay during favorable weather conditions .
Preferably , place the mixture when the atmospheric temperature is between 55 and 75 °F ; when the wind velocity is low ; when the relative humidity is normal or high ; and when hot conditions or rain are not expected .
In all instances , place and keep the PMC overlay at a temperature above 45 °F for at least 96 hours after placement .
Provide approved housing , heating , insulation methods , or some combination thereof , during cold weather .
Do not place the mixture when the temperature is 85 °F or higher ; when the wind velocity is high ; when the relative humidity is extremely low ; when rain is expected within the working period ; or when any other atmospheric conditions cause difficulty in the satisfactory finishing , texturing , or curing of the overlay .
This may require night work or other limited work periods .
Keep PMC overlay aggregate and sand as cool as possible at the storage site during high temperatures to help prevent cracking in the new overlay .
619.06 Hydro-Demolition Before placing the overlay , hydro-blast the concrete surface to be covered to the depth shown on the Plans .
In areas where machine hydro-blasting can not reach , in areas of spalling , and where steel reinforcement is exposed , remove deteriorated concrete to sound material using hand tools .
Do not use pneumatic hammers heavier than a nominal 45 pounds .
After hydro-blasting , clear the deck of all debris .
Do not allow traffic on the cleaned portion of the deck .
619.07 Cleaning After hydro-blasting but before placing the overlay , power wash the entire area of the deck surface with a minimum 10,000-pound per square inch washing system to provide a bright , clean appearance that is free from laitance , dust , dirt , oil , grease , bituminous material , paint , and all other foreign matter .
Perform the hydro-demolition of an area of the deck within the 24-hour period preceding the placement of the overlay on the area .
Clean the existing deck using a process that will ensure conformance with the air and water pollution regulations applicable to the county or city where the site of work is located and with applicable safety and health regulations .
Discontinue use of any method that does not consistently produce satisfactory work and conform to the above requirements , and replace with an acceptable method .
While cleaning , reasonably confine all debris of every type , including dirty water , resulting from the cleaning operation .
Immediately and thoroughly clean such debris from the blast- 619.08 675 cleaned surfaces and all other areas where any escaped debris may have accumulated .
Protect the cleaned areas , as necessary , against contamination before placing the overlay .
Cover cleaned areas with a plastic cover that will be rolled up as the placement equipment passes over it so that the cleaned surface is not exposed to wheels , dirt , oil , grease , or any other contaminants .

Form grooves to drain transversely .
Correct areas that do not conform to these requirements using approved methods at no cost to the Department .
619.11 Curing Promptly cover the overlay surface with a single layer of wet burlap .
Avoid using new burlap , as even when pre-soaked , it can dry out quickly .
It may be necessary , at the Engineer ’ s request , to wet the burlap and let it dry out , and then repeat this procedure several times to allow for total absorption .
Use white plastic ( visqueen ) to cover the wet burlap .
Consistently spray a mist of water over the burlap before covering it with white plastic ; however , ensure that the amount of water sprayed is not so excessive as to damage the fresh overlay surface .

Provide all necessary small tools or implements to perform the work .
CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 709.05 Foundation Preparation Immediately before constructing riprap or slope pavement , trim the slopes or ground surface within reasonably close conformity to the lines and grades shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer , and thoroughly compact the slopes or ground surface using hand or mechanical tamps .
On slopes , place the bottom of the riprap at least 2 feet below the natural ground surface , unless otherwise directed by the Engineer .
709.06 Rubble-Stone Riprap ( Grouted ) A .
Placing Stone Construct Rubble-Stone Riprap ( Grouted ) by hand on the prepared foundation .
Place the stones as close together as is practicable to minimize voids .
709.06 740 When constructing rubble-stone riprap in layers , tie the layers together using large stones protruding from one layer into the other .
Construct rubble-stone riprap to a standard depth of 12 inches , unless otherwise shown on the Plans or directed by the Engineer , but in no case to less than 10 inches in depth .
Ensure that , for each 25 square feet of surface , Rubble-Stone Riprap has an average depth of not less than the depth shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer , or the standard depth required in these Specifications .
Place each stone with the larger dimension parallel to the surface upon which it is set , except as set forth above to provide keys between layers .
Place the length as directed by the Engineer , and set each main stone against the adjoining stones to provide close contact .
Place stone so as to equally distribute the large stones to the extent possible .
After a workable area of the riprap has been set , shape the stones by knapping to a uniform surface .
Thoroughly chink the voids and fill with the smaller stones and spalls .
Continue this work as construction progresses .
B. Grouting After chinking and filling , fill the voids between the stones with grout .
Take care to prevent earth or sand from filling the spaces between the stones before the grout is poured .
To fill the voids , use grout composed of one part Portland cement and four parts sand , measured by volume , and mixed thoroughly with sufficient water to make a grout of a consistency that will flow into and completely fill the voids .
Mix this grout either in a one-bag mixer or larger for not less than 1-1/2 minutes , or mix it by hand in a watertight box of sufficient capacity to accommodate a batch of at least one bag of cement .
Continue to hand mix in a manner and for a period satisfactory to the Engineer .
Immediately before pouring the grout , sprinkle the stones with water .
Pour the grout carefully into the voids between the stones , beginning at the lower portions of the riprap and progressing upward .
Ensure that the entire bottom line of voids is filled with grout before pouring the line of voids next above .
To pour the grout , use vessels of adequate 709.07 741 size and shape .
Broadcasting , slopping , or spilling of grout from the vessels on the surface of the riprap will not be permitted .
Progress of pouring shall be sufficiently slow to prevent the grout from oozing from the voids and flowing over the surface .
During the pouring operations and continuing until the grout has reached its initial set , use fiber brooms to maintain a uniform distribution .
Continue the grouting operations until all the voids have been completely filled and the grout has set even with the surface of the riprap .
C. Curing As soon as any section of the grouted riprap has hardened sufficiently , sprinkle it with water until the riprap has been covered with burlap , cotton , or jute mates , earth , or liquid membrane-forming compound .
Maintain the mats or earth by soaking with water for a period of not less than 72 hours .
The water used for wetting and curing the grouted riprap shall be free from salt or alkali .
709.07 Sacked Sand-Cement Riprap Construct Sacked Sand-Cement Riprap by placing sacks , filled approximately 3/4 full with a mixture of sand and cement , on the prepared foundation .
Mix the sand and cement dry , with a mechanical mixer , in the proportion of 94 pounds of cement to 5 cubic feet of dry sand , until the mixture is uniform in color .
After the mixing has been completed , pour the sand- cement mixture into sacks , of approximately 1-cubic foot capacity , until they are approximately 3/4 filled .
Securely fasten the sacks with hog rings , by sewing , or by using other suitable methods that prevent leakage of the mixture from the bags .
Bed the sacks of sand-cement , by hand , on the prepared grade with all the fastened ends on the grade and with the joints broken .
The completed riprap shall have a minimum thickness of 10 inches , measured perpendicular to the slope .
The surface shall not vary more than 3 inches above or below the desired theoretical plane .
Ram and pack the sacks against each other , and tamp on the surface to form close contact and to ensure a uniform surface .
Immediately after placing and tamping the sacks of sand-cement , thoroughly soak them by sprinkling with water .
Do not apply water under high pressure .
709.08 742 Before soaking with water , remove and replace sacks of sand-cement that were ripped or broken during placing .
709.08 Reinforced Concrete Slope Pavement Construct Reinforced Concrete Slope Pavement as shown on the Plans and in accordance with the applicable requirements of 604 , except that the concrete shall be of such consistency that it will not flow on the slope and that will allow finishing to the thickness shown on the Plans .
Score or saw the slope pavement for a depth of 1 inch on 6-foot centers , both ways , or as directed by the Engineer .
Use a 1/2-inch preformed expansion joint filler wherever the slope pavement abuts a portion of the bridge sub-structure .
Remove forms , which may be of wood or metal , after the concrete has set .
Cure the concrete as specified in 501.18 .
709.09 Machined Riprap Take care in preparing the riprap subgrade to ensure that no reduction in the design waterway occurs .
Do not place any riprap until the final subgrade elevation has been verified by the Engineer .
When directed by the Engineer , roll the riprap down with metal tracked equipment to provide a more dense stone mass with final contours in reasonable conformance to the Plans .
Do not begin to place the super-structure until the Engineer has accepted the final elevation of the riprap .
Upon completion of the work , visually inspect to ensure that approximately 50 % of the surface area consists of stones no smaller than half of the maximum size specified .
Dump and place the material using appropriate power equipment in a manner that will produce a uniform surface appearance .
Hand work may be required to correct irregularities .
When preparing the site , adhere to the provisions for erosion control specified in 209 and for channel excavation specified in 203.02.C .
When required by the Plans or permits , or as directed by the Engineer , properly tamp into the subsurface , or otherwise blend into the substrate , embedded riprap in streams , conveyances , diversions , or other sensitive areas .
Ensure that water will flow over the embedded riprap and that flow 709.10 743 is not lost below or within the rock .
If clean rock is required by the Plans or permit , or as directed by the Engineer , provide rock that meets the provisions of 709.02 for clean rock .

Do not use steel wheel rollers for this purpose .
716.07 Paint A .
Application of Painted Pavement Markings Apply paint with a spray-type machine capable of satisfactorily applying the paint under pressure through a nozzle that sprays directly upon the pavement at a rate not to exceed 880 feet per minute .
Equip the machine with : 1 .
Air blast device for cleaning the pavement ahead of the painting operation ; 2 .
Guide pointer to keep the machine on an accurate line ; 3 .
Device to agitate the paint ; 4 .
Device to maintain a uniform flow and application of the paint ; 5 .
Automatic device to provide a broken or skip line of the length required ; 6 .
At least two spray guns capable of being operated either individually or together ; 7 .
Automatic counting mechanism capable of recording the number of linear feet of material applied to the roadway surface with an accuracy of 0.50 % , to be checked by the Engineer ; and 8 .
Accurate meters that register quantities for both white and yellow applied paint to the nearest gallon .
716.07 815 When using waterborne paint , ensure the equipment is capable of heating the material from ambient air temperature to 123 °F .
Equip the machine with a bead or sphere dispenser that can be regulated to dispense the spheres automatically at the uniform rate required .
The equipment shall be designed and operated so as to allow traffic to safely pass on the roadbed .
Do not apply paint unless the ambient air temperature is at least 45 °F .
However , if the Engineer directs that paint be applied when air temperatures are below 45 °F , heat the paint according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations .
For the following operations , the Engineer will not require large automatic spray application machinery meeting the preceding requirements , provided the Contractor selects pavement marking equipment capable of producing a uniform , acceptable finished product consistent with the Plans and Specifications : 1 .
Installation of temporary pavement markings .
2 .
Installation of permanent pavement markings on projects having a total length of 1,000 feet or less .
3 .
Installation of permanent pavement markings on an individual project segment having a total length of 1,000 feet or less on an intermittent project .
Clean the pavement surface before placing any pavement marking material .
Locate and place temporary markings on final pavement surfaces so as to underlie or coincide with the permanent pavement markings .
Perform cleaning and painting using equipment of the kind and in the manner provided by previously specified equipment .
On sections where no previously applied line is available to serve as a guide or if the line is to be re-located , spot the proposed location of the new line with paint in advance of the application .
On tangent sections , space the control points no more than 500 feet apart and on curves at intervals that will ensure the accurate location of the line .
Leave gaps in all lines at intersections in accordance with the MUTCD or as directed by the Engineer .
716.07 816 Do not apply any paint over a chalk line , wire , or cord , and instead offset such guide marks from the paint line to be placed .
On sections where previously applied lines are visible , use the old lines unless otherwise directed .
Do not apply any paint to areas of pavement when moisture remains on the surface , or when wind conditions may cause a film of dust to be deposited on the line areas after these areas have been prepared for painting .
Apply drop-on type glass beads uniformly to the painted surface at a uniform rate of not less than 6 pounds per gallon of paint applied .
Apply paint so as to deposit a uniform wet film thickness of 0.015 inch ( within a reasonable tolerance ) and at a speed not to exceed 880 feet per minute .
This is at the rate of 17 gallons per mile for a solid stripe 4 inches wide .
Use this rate of application for all types of paint , making proper adjustments in gallons for an intermittent line or wider lines .
Ensure that the quantity of paint does not under-run the designated amount by more than 5 % .
If a check of the rate of application indicates a greater variation , stop the work until the paint machine is properly adjusted or replaced .
This percent of variation is set out to give the Contractor some leeway in starting the job and in getting the machine in adjustment ; it is not expected that there will be either a continuous overrun or under-run , but that the final average rate of application will closely approach the rate established above .
When reflectorized paint is required for temporary or final marking , install the paint to permanent standards at the end of each day ’ s work .
Do not leave any short , unmarked sections .
Protect traffic lines and markings .
Place warning and directional signs as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer to control traffic in the marking area .
If the drying time of the material being used exceeds 60 seconds , protect the newly applied markings by placing traffic cones or other approved warning devices at frequent intervals as directed .
Leave these devices on the line until the material is dry or firm enough not to track or receive impressions from normal traffic .
Remove these devices as soon as possible to prevent a traffic hazard .
Do not leave such devices in the roadway overnight .
If so directed , provide flaggers to direct traffic .
Apply paint to appear as clearly delineated lines with minimal crookedness and waviness , giving due consideration to the contours and roughness of the pavement .
Segments of broken line stripe shall 716.08 817 square off positively at each end .
The paint lines shall be without mist , drip , or splatter .
Remove and/or correct , to the Engineer ’ s satisfaction and at no additional cost to the Department , lines that do not meet these requirements when placed .
Operate the paint equipment so that it will be unnecessary for traffic to cross the newly painted line behind the equipment in order to safely pass the painting machine , and so as to allow traffic to keep moving at all times .
B .
Removal of Painted Markings Remove painted pavement markings where specified or directed by the Engineer .
Obtain the Engineer ’ s approval of the paint removal method before beginning the work .
Do not remove existing painted pavement markings by painting over them with black paint or asphalt .
When the method of removal causes sand or other material to accumulate on the pavement , remove the residue as the work progresses .
Remove painted markings by methods that cause the least possible damage to the pavement .
Repair damage to the pavement or surface caused by pavement marking removal as directed by the Engineer and at no cost to the Department .
Where a plastic marking will replace the painted marking and paint removal is specified in the Contract , remove enough of the paint to ensure proper installation of the plastic .
The paint removal shall be uniform and shall expose a minimum of 75 % of the surface area that is to receive the plastic materials .
