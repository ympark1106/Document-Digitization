OPENING AND READING OF BIDS At the time , date , and location specified in the official advertisement , the Letting Official will publicly open and read bids .
11 .
TABULATING BIDS 11.1 .
Official Total Bid Amount .
The Department will sum the products of the quantities and the unit prices bid in the proposal form to determine the official total bid amount , except as provided in Section 2.11.5. , “ Consideration of Unit Prices. ” The official total bid amount is the basis for determining the apparent low Bidder .
The total bid amounts will be compared and the results made public .
11.2 .
Consideration of Bid Format .
When a Bidder submits both an electronic bid and a printed bid that is responsive , the unit bid prices in the printed bid will be used to determine the total bid amount .
If the printed bid is incomplete or nonresponsive , the electronic bid will be used in the tabulation of the total bid amount .
If a Bidder submits 2 or more printed bids , all responsive bids will be tabulated .
The bid with the lowest tabulation will be used to determine the total bid amount .
11.3 .
Rounding of Unit Prices .
The Department will round off all unit bids involving fractional parts of a cent to the nearest one-tenth cent ( $ 0.001 ) in determining the amount of the bid as well as computing the amount due for payment of each item under the Contract .
For rounding purposes , entries of five-hundredths of a cent ( $ 0.0005 ) or more will be rounded up to the next highest tenth of a cent , while entries less than five- hundredths of a cent will be rounded down to the next lowest tenth of a cent .
11.4 .
Interpretation of Unit Prices .
The Department will make a documented determination of the unit bid price if a unit bid price is illegible or conflicting in the case of replacement alternate items .
The Department ’ s determination will be final .
11.5 .
Consideration of Unit Prices .
11.5.1 .
Additive Alternate Items .
The Department will sum the products of the quantities and the unit prices bid for the regular items in the proposal form to determine the total bid amount for the base bid .
The official total bid amount will be determined by the summation of the base bid plus a pre-determined order of additive alternate items , not to exceed the Department ’ s budgeted amount for the Contract .
An estimate of the budgeted amount may be shown on the plans .
The Contract will identify the base bid work and additive alternate work to be performed .
The Department makes no guarantee that the additive alternate work will be required .
11.5.2 .
A + B Bidding .
The official total bid amount will be determined by the summation of the Contract amount and the time element .
The Department will use the following formula to make the calculation : A + B1 + B2 + BX + … + BT The Contract amount , equal to A in the formula , is determined by the summation of the products of the approximate quantities shown in the proposal and the unit bid prices bid , and the time element , equal to B1 , B2 , BX ( when phases are included as bid components ) , and BT ( substantial completion of the project when included as a bid component ) , of the bid is determined by multiplying the number of working days bid to substantially complete the project , or phases , by the daily road-user cost ( RUC ) provided on the plans .
When partial days are bid they will be rounded up to the nearest whole day .
The formula above determines the low Bidder and establishes the Contract time .
2 19 11.5.3 .
Rubber Additives .
For proposed Contracts without federal funds , if an alternate item for “ Hot Asphalt- Rubber Surface Treatments ” or “ Hot-Mix Asphalt Concrete Pavement ” which contains ground tire rubber is shown in the proposal form and the Bidder bids that alternate item , the amounts bid for “ Hot Asphalt-Rubber ” and “ Aggregate ” or “ Hot-Mix Asphalt Concrete ” will be reduced to 85 % of the amounts actually bid .
This reduction will only be used for the purposes of determining the lowest Bidder .
To qualify , the ground tire rubber used must be produced from scrap tire ground in a facility in Texas .
Payment for “ Hot Asphalt- Rubber ” and “ Aggregate ” or “ Hot-Mix Asphalt Concrete ” will be at the actual unit prices bid .
11.5.4 .
“ Buy America. ” The use of foreign steel is only allowed when shown on the plans .
For a Bidder who proposes to use foreign steel or iron materials to be considered the apparent low Bidder , their total bid must be at least 25 % lower than the next lowest bid if that bid proposes to use domestic steel or iron materials .
This requirement does not apply to minimal use of steel or iron materials provided that the total cost of all foreign source items used in the project , as delivered to the project site , is less than $ 2,500 or one-tenth-of- one-percent ( 1/10 of 1 % ) of the Contract amount , whichever is greater .
11.5.5 .
Home State Bidding Preference .
For the purpose of determining the apparent low Bidder on proposed Contracts without federal funds , the Department will select the option that results in the greatest bidding preference to the resident Bidder .
11.5.5.1 .
Reverse Application of Non-Resident Bidder ’ s Home State Bidding Preference .
The total bid amount will be based upon the reverse application of the non-resident Bidder ’ s home state bidding preference , if any .
This will also apply to another state ’ s preference for a Bidder that offers materials grown , produced , processed , or manufactured in that state .
Any reverse application of the home state bidding preference would be the greater of the following :  the amount by which a resident Bidder would be required to underbid the non-resident Bidder to obtain a comparable contract in the state in which the non-resident ’ s principle place of business is located ; or  the amount by which a resident Bidder would be required to underbid the non-resident Bidder to obtain a comparable contract in the state in which a majority of the manufacturing relating to the Contract will be performed .
11.5.5.2 .
Texas Home State Bidding Preference .
A Bidder will be considered the apparent low Bidder if the Bidder ’ s home office is located in this state and their bid does not exceed an amount equal to 105 % of the apparent low bid received from a Bidder whose home office is not located in this state .
This will not apply to a Bidder from a bordering state whose state does not give a preference to a Bidder in a manner similar to this Section .
12 .
CONSIDERATION OF BID ERRORS The Department will consider a claim of a bid error by the apparent low Bidder if the following requirements have been met :  a written notification is submitted to the Department within 5 business days after the date the bid is opened ; and  the submittal identifies the items of work involved and include bidding documentation .
The Department may request clarification of submitted documentation .
The Department will evaluate the claim of an error by the apparent low Bidder by considering the following :  the bid error relates to a material item of work ,  the bid error amount is a significant portion of the total bid ,  the bid error occurred despite the exercise of ordinary care , and  the delay of the proposed work will not impact cost and safety to the public .
2 20 Acceptance of the bid error claim by the Department will result in the rejection of all bids .
The erring Contractor will not be allowed to bid the project when it is relet .
Rejection of bids due to the Contractor ’ s bid error may result in the application of sanctions by the Department .
13 .
TIE BIDS If the official total bid amount for 2 or more Bidders is equal and those bids are the lowest submitted , each tie Bidder will be given an opportunity to withdraw their bid .
If 2 or more tie Bidders do not withdraw their bids , the low Bidder will be determined by a coin toss or a series of coin tosses when there are more than 2 Bidders .
If all tie Bidders request to withdraw their bids , no withdrawals will be allowed and the low Bidder will be determined by a coin toss or a series of coin tosses when there are more than 2 Bidders .
The Letting Official will preside over the proceedings .

Notify the Engineer in writing when differing site conditions are encountered .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor when the Department discovers differing site conditions .
Unless directed otherwise , suspend work on the affected items and leave the site undisturbed .
The Engineer will investigate the conditions and determine whether differing site conditions exist .
If the differing site conditions cause an increase or decrease in the cost or number of working days specified for the performance of the Contract , the Engineer will make adjustments , excluding the loss of anticipated profits , in accordance with the Contract .
Additional compensation will be made only if the required written notice has been provided .
6 .
REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION AND DAMAGES Notify the Engineer in writing of any intent to request additional compensation once there is knowledge of the basis for the request .
An assessment of damages is not required to be part of this notice but is desirable .
The intent of the written notice requirement is to provide the Engineer an opportunity to evaluate the request and to keep an accurate account of the actual costs that may arise .
Minimize impacts and costs .
If written notice is not given , the Contractor waives the right to additional compensation unless the circumstances could have reasonably prevented the Contractor from knowing the cost impact before performing the work .
Notice of the request and the documentation of the costs will not be construed as proof or substantiation of the validity of the request .
Submit the request in enough detail to enable the Engineer to determine the basis for entitlement , adjustment in the number of working days specified in the Contract , and compensation .
Damages occur when impacts that are the responsibility of the Department result in additional costs to the Contractor that could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time of letting .
Costs of performing 4 28 additional work are not considered damages .
For Contractor damages , the intent is to reimburse the Contractor for actual expenses arising out of a compensable impact .
No profit or markups , other than labor burden , will be allowed .
For damages , labor burden will be reimbursed at 35 % unless the Contractor can justify higher actual cost .
Justification for a higher percentage must be in accordance with the methodology provided by the Department , submitted separately for project overhead labor and direct labor , and determined and submitted by a Certified Public Accountant ( CPA ) .
Submit CPA-prepared labor burden rates directly to the Construction Division for approval .
The Department will not consider fees and interest on requests for additional compensation and damages .
Fees include , but are not limited to : preparation , attorney , printing , shipping , and various other fees .
If the Contractor requests compensation for damages and the damages are determined to be compensable , then standby equipment costs and project overhead compensation will be based on the duration of the compensable damage and will be limited as follows : 6.1 .
Standby Equipment Costs .
Payment will be made in accordance with Section 9.7.1.4.3. , “ Standby Equipment Costs. ” 6.2 .
Project Overhead .
Project overhead is defined as the administrative and supervisory expenses incurred at the work locations .
When delay to project completion occurs , reimbursement for project overhead for the Contractor will be made using the following options :  reimbursed at 6 % ( computed as daily cost by dividing 6 % of the original Contract amount by the number of original Contract work days ) , or  actual documented costs for the impacted period .
Project overhead for delays impacting subcontractors will be determined from actual documented costs submitted by the Contractor .
Time extensions and suspensions alone will not be justification for reimbursement for project overhead .
6.3 .
Home Office Overhead .
The Department will not compensate the Contractor for home office overhead .
7 .

The Department ’ s Contract claim procedure has been established in accordance with Title 43 of the Texas Administrative Code , Part 1 , Chapter 9 , Subchapter A , Rule §9.2 , Contract Claim Procedure .
Detailed instructions for submitting a claim and its components can be found on the Department ’ s website .
4 29 If a claim has been submitted and the Contractor wishes to resume negotiations with the District , notify the CCC in writing of the intent to resume negotiations at the District level and request review of the claim be suspended by the CCC pending the outcome of the negotiations .
File a claim after completion of the Contract or when required for orderly performance of the Contract .
For a claim resulting from enforcement of a warranty period , file the claim no later than one year after expiration of the warranty period .
For all other claims , file the claim no later than the date the Department issues notice to the Contractor that they are in default , the date the Department terminates the Contract , or one year after the date of final acceptance of the Contract .

 Step 2 .
Predict the effect of the impact on the schedule update used in Step 1 .
 Step 3 .
Track the effects of the impact on the schedule during its occurrence .
 Step 4 .
Establish the status of the project after the impact ’ s effect has ended and provide details identifying any mitigating actions or circumstances used to keep the project ongoing during the impact period .
Determine the time impact by comparing the status of the work before the impact ( Step 1 ) to the prediction of the effect of the impact ( Step 2 ) , if requested , and to actual effects of the impact once it is complete ( Step 4 ) .
Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer , steps 1 , 3 , and 4 , must be completed before consideration of a Contract time extension or adjustment of a milestone date will be provided .
Time extensions will only be considered when delays that affect milestone dates or the Contract completion date are beyond the Contractor ’ s control .
Submit Step 4 no later than 15 calendar days after the impact ’ s effects have ended or when all the information on the effect has been realized .
Submit one electronic backup copy of the complete time impact analysis and a copy of the full project schedule incorporating the time impact analysis .

Pavement temperatures are estimated from air temperatures using an algorithm contained in a Department-supplied computer program , may be provided by the Department , or by following the procedures outlined in AASHTO MP 2 and PP 28 .
2 .
This requirement may be waived at the Department ’ s discretion if the supplier warrants that the asphalt binder can be adequately pumped , mixed , and compacted at temperatures that meet all applicable safety , environmental , and constructability requirements .
At test temperatures where the binder is a Newtonian fluid , any suitable standard means of viscosity measurement may be used , including capillary ( T 201 or T 202 ) or rotational viscometry ( T 316 ) .
3 .
Viscosity at 135°C is an indicator of mixing and compaction temperatures that can be expected in the lab and field .
High values may indicate high mixing and compaction temperatures .
Additionally , significant variation can occur from batch to batch .
Contractors should be aware that variation could significantly impact their mixing and compaction operations .
Contractors are therefore responsible for addressing any constructability issues that may arise .
4 .
For quality control of unmodified asphalt binder production , measurement of the viscosity of the original asphalt binder may be substituted for dynamic shear measurements of G * /sin (  ) at test temperatures where the asphalt is a Newtonian fluid .
Any suitable standard means of viscosity measurement may be used , including capillary ( T 201 or T 202 ) or rotational viscometry ( T 316 ) .
5 .
Silicone beam molds , as described in AASHTO TP 1-93 , are acceptable for use .
6 .
If creep stiffness is below 300 MPa , direct tension test is not required .
If creep stiffness is between 300 and 600 MPa , the direct tension failure strain requirement can be used instead of the creep stiffness requirement .
The m-value requirement must be satisfied in both cases .
7 .
Maximum values for unaged and RTFO aged dynamic shear apply only to materials used as substitute binders , as described in specification Items 340 , “ Dense-Graded Hot-Mix Asphalt ( Small Quantity ) , ” 341 , “ Dense-Graded Hot-Mix Asphalt , ” and 344 , “ Superpave Mixtures. ” 3 .

After testing , the Engineer will return the cores to the Contractor .
The Engineer may have the cores transported back to the Department ’ s laboratory at the HMA plant via the Contractor ’ s haul truck or other designated vehicle .
In such cases where the cores will be out of the 346 324 Engineer ’ s possession during transport , the Engineer will use Department-provided security bags and the Roadway Core Custody protocol located at http : //www.txdot.gov/business/specifications.htm to provide a secure means and process that protects the integrity of the cores during transport .
Decide whether to include the pair of cores in the air void determination for that sublot if the core height before trimming is less than the minimum untrimmed value shown in Table 10 .
Trim the cores as described above before delivering to the Engineer if electing to have the cores included in the air void determination .
Deliver untrimmed cores to the Engineer and inform the Engineer of the decision to not have the cores included in air void determination if electing to not have the cores included in air void determination .
The placement pay factor for the sublot will be 1.000 if cores will not be included in air void determination .
Instead of the Contractor trimming the cores on-site immediately after coring , the Engineer and the Contractor may mutually agree to have the trimming operations performed at an alternate location such as a field laboratory or other similar location .
In such cases , the Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately after they are obtained from the roadway and will retain custody of the cores until testing is completed .

 Sliding Elastomeric Bearings .
Consisting of a steel top ( sole ) plate with a stainless steel facing ( upper component ) bearing on a lower component .
The lower component consists of a layer of polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) recessed and bonded to a steel plate that is vulcanized to the top of a laminated elastomeric bearing pad with or without special components ( steel guide bars and bottom plate ) .
Plain and laminated elastomeric bridge bearings are designated by hardness ( durometer ) , size , and configuration and , in the case of laminated bearings , by the thickness of the individual layers of elastomer and the size and position of any steel top plates .
1.2 .
High Load Multi-Rotational ( HLMR ) Bearings :  Disc Bearings .
Consisting of a polyether urethane disc contained between upper and lower steel bearing plates .
The bearing has a shear resisting mechanism to prevent relative horizontal movement of the bearing plates and transmit horizontal loads .
 Pot Bearings .
Consisting of a plain elastomeric disc confined by a shallow steel cylinder ( pot ) and a steel piston which engages the cylinder sufficiently to prevent their relative horizontal movement .
Provision for sliding movements ( if required ) uses a separate steel top plate with stainless steel facing ( upper component ) bearing on a lower component , and a lower component with a layer of PTFE bonded to the top of the upper steel bearing plate of the HLMR assembly .
If required on the plans , restriction of lateral movement is provided by guide bars integrated with the steel top plate and interface components of the same stainless steel facing and PTFE layer .
HLMR bridge bearings are designated by configuration ( fixed , multi-direction expansion , or guided expansion ) and the vertical service reaction requirements .
Fixed configurations allow rotation about the horizontal axis and prevent horizontal movement in all directions .
Multi-direction expansion configurations allow rotation about the horizontal axis and horizontal movement in all directions .
Guided expansion configurations allow rotation about the horizontal axis and horizontal movement in one direction as indicated on the plans , while guide bars and keyways restrict horizontal movement in the orthogonal direction .

Before making non-miscellaneous welds on structural steel , a welder must pass the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 qualification test for groove welds for plates of unlimited thickness in the vertical ( 3G ) and overhead ( 4G ) positions with the following additional requirements :  Use metal for test plates that meets Item 442 , “ Metal for Structures , ” with a minimum yield point of 36 ksi .
The minimum width of test plate must be sufficient to accommodate the radiograph inspection of 5-1/4 continuous inches of the weld , not counting the ends of the weld .
 Use approved electrodes meeting the required class in accordance with Table 1 and , in the case of FCAW , in accordance with the approved WPS .
 Have a radiographic inspection performed on the weld on each test plate .
Any porosity or fusion-type discontinuity with greatest dimension larger than 1/16 in .
found in the weld will result in failure of the test .
Discontinuities with greatest dimension less than 1/16 in .
are acceptable provided the sum of their greatest dimensions does not exceed 3/8 in .
in any inch of weld .
 Have 2 side-bend specimens prepared , tested , and inspected for each test plate .
The test must be administered by an approved laboratory and welding observed by laboratory personnel .
Submit 2 copies of the certification issued by the laboratory , all accompanying test papers , and the radiographic films to the Bridge Division for review .
The Bridge Division issues Department certification papers if the laboratory ’ s certification is approved .
A welder must also demonstrate to the Engineer a thorough knowledge of the required welding procedures together with the ability and desire to follow them and make welds of sound quality and good appearance .
The certification issued by an approved laboratory is accepted for 1 mo .
from the time of certification , during which time the welder may work on Department projects if the work is satisfactory .
Certification papers issued by the Department remain in effect as long as the welder performs acceptable work as determined by the Bridge Division .
The certification may be cancelled at any time if the welder ’ s work is not acceptable .
For SMAW , a welder certified using EXX18 electrodes is qualified to weld with all approved SMAW electrodes up to E90XX to join metals with a maximum specified yield strength of 65 ksi .

Anchor Bolt Tightening .
Perform the following procedure :  Coat the threads of the anchor bolts with electrically conducting lubricant .
449 623  Install the bottom nuts on the bolts , 1 on each bolt .
 Level the top template ( using it as a guide ) by adjusting the bottom nuts so the template rests on each nut and the distance between the top of the concrete shaft and the bottom surface of the bottom nut is approximately 1/2 in .
 Remove the template .
 Coat the bearing surfaces of the bottom nuts and washers with electrically conducting lubricant .
 Install bottom washers on bolts , 1 on each bolt .
 Erect and plumb the structure as specified .
Adjust the bottom nuts so each is bearing equally on the washer or base plate .
The truss for cantilever overhead sign support structures and the mast arm for traffic signal poles must be removed during anchor bolt tightening .
 With the plumbed structure supported by a crane , coat the bearing surfaces of the top nuts and washers with electrically conducting lubricant .
Install 1 washer and 1 top nut on each bolt .
Turn the top nuts onto the bolts so each is hand-tight against the washer or base plate .
 Turn each bottom nut to a snug-tight condition using a wrench .
 Verify the structure is still plumb and still supported by the crane .
Begin turn-of-the-nut method by turning each top nut down to the same snug-tight condition .
