In addition , design criteria and constraints listed in the Structural Selection Report can not be modified or relaxed as part of a VECP unless significant and previously unknown benefits can be proven to the Engineer .
Experimental or demonstration-type design concepts , products , structures , or elements that have not been pre-approved by CDOT , in writing , for general use will be considered a VECP ( Category A ) .
Category A proposals will also result in a realized and shared cost savings to CDOT .
Cost savings generated to the Contract as a result of VECP offered by the Contractor and accepted by CDOT shall be shared between the Contractor and CDOT .
All other VECPs that do not meet the previous requirements will be classified as a VECP ( Category B ) .
Net cost savings on VECPs that are less than $ 25,000 can be kept by the Contractor .
Net cost savings greater than $ 25,000 shall be split equally between the Contractor and CDOT as defined in the Basis of Payment section of this specification .
Both VECP ( Category A ) and VECP ( Category B ) will produce savings to CDOT or provide improved project quality without impairing essential functions and characteristics of the facility .
Essential functions include but are not limited to : service life , requirements for planned future development , prior commitments to governmental agencies or the public , corridor requirements , economy of operation , ease of maintenance , desired appearance , safety , and impacts to the traveling public or to the environment during and after construction .
The Contractor may submit either a full VECP or a preliminary Conceptual VECP , followed by a full proposal .
These proposals are subject to rejection at any time if they do not meet the criteria outlined in this subsection .
( a ) Submittal of Conceptual Proposal .
For a VECP ( Category A ) that requires a significant amount of design or other development resources , the Contractor may submit an abbreviated Conceptual Proposal for preliminary evaluation .
The Engineer will evaluate the information provided .
The Contractor will then be advised in writing if any conditions or parameters of the Conceptual Proposal are found to be grounds for rejection .
Preliminary review of a conceptual proposal reduces the Contractor ’ s risk of subsequent rejection but does not commit CDOT to eventual approval of the full VECP .
The following information shall be submitted for each Conceptual Proposal : ( 1 ) Statement that the proposal is submitted as a Conceptual VECP .
( 2 ) General description of the difference between the existing Contract and 23 104.07 the proposed change , and the advantages and disadvantages of each , including effects on service life , requirements for planned future development , prior commitments to governmental agencies or the public , corridor requirements , economy of operation , ease of maintenance , desired appearance , safety , and impacts to the traveling public or to the environment during and after construction .

The PE seal is not required where complete details are provided on the plans .
33 105.03 Conformity to the Contract .
All work performed and all materials furnished shall conform to the lines , grades , cross sections , dimensions , and material requirements , including tolerances , shown in the Contract .
All Hot Mix Asphalt ( HMA ) materials or work will be evaluated for conformity to the Contract in accordance with subsection 105.05 except HMA that is used for patching and temporary pavement .
For those items of work where working tolerances are not specified , the Contractor shall perform the work in a manner consistent with reasonable and customary manufacturing and construction practices .
When the Engineer finds that the materials furnished , the work performed , or the finished product does not conform with the Contract but that reasonably acceptable work has been produced , the Engineer will determine the extent the work will be accepted and remain in place .
If accepted the Engineer will ( 1 ) document the basis for acceptance by Contract Modification Order which will provide for an appropriate reduction in the Contract price for such work or materials not otherwise provided for in this subsection or ( 2 ) notify the Contractor in writing that the Contract unit price will be reduced in accordance with this subsection when P is 25 or less , or ( 3 ) in lieu of a price reduction , permit correction or replacement of the finished product provided the correction or replacement does not adversely affect the work .
When the Engineer finds the materials furnished , work performed , or the finished product are not in conformity with the Contract and has resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory product , the work or materials shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected by and at the expense of the Contractor .
If asphalt cement testing demonstrates that asphalt cement was acid modified or alkaline modified , the supplier will be automatically decertified .
In addition , all material placed containing the acid modified or alkaline modified asphalt cement shall be removed and replaced with specification material at no cost to the Department .
Materials will be sampled and tested by the Department in accordance with the sampling and testing schedules and procedures contained in the Department ’ s Field Materials Manual .
The approximate maximum quantity represented by each sample will be as set forth in the schedules .
An additional number of samples in relation to the quantity of material represented may be selected and tested at the Engineer ’ s discretion .
The quantity represented by five consecutive random samples will constitute a lot whenever production schedules and material continuity permit .
The Engineer may establish a lot consisting of the quantity represented by any number of consecutive random samples from one to seven inclusive when it is necessary to represent short production runs , significant material changes , or other unusual characteristics of the work .
Tests that are determined to have sampling or testing errors will not be used .
34 105.03 Materials or work will be evaluated for price reduction only when deviations from specifications occur on any of the several individual tests for the lot .
The several individual test values will be averaged and the percent of price reduction for the lot will be determined by applicable formula .
The formula in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) below will be used only when the lot is represented by three to seven tests inclusive .
( 1 ) The formula , P = ( Xn + aR – Tu ) F , will be used if a maximum limit only is specified or ; when the average of the several test values is above the mid point of the specification band or above the job-mix formula value .
( 2 ) The formula , P = ( TL + aR – Xn ) F , will be used if a minimum limit only is specified or ; when the average of the several test values is below the mid point of the specification band or below the job-mix formula value .
( 3 ) When the lot is represented by fewer than three tests , the materials will be evaluated for price reduction by the following procedure : Lots represented by two tests will be divided into two separate lots represented by one test each , as determined by the Engineer .
Each lot which deviates from the specifications will be price reduced by one of the following formulas .
When a maximum limit only is specified or the test value is above the maximum specified limit , the formula P = 0.76 ( To – Tu ) F will be used .
When a minimum limit only is specified or the test value is below the minimum specified limit , the formula P = 0.76 ( TL – To ) F will be used .
When a lot is represented by one test only , the materials will be evaluated for price reduction as described in this paragraph .
Where : P is the percent of reduction in contract price , Xn is the average of the several test values from samples taken from the lot , with “ n ” indicating the number of values , a is a variable factor to be used in “ n ” changes according to the following : when n is 3 , a = 0.45 ; n is 4 , a = 0.38 ; n is 5 , a = 0.33 ; n is 6 , a = 0.30 ; and n is 7 , a = 0.28 .
R is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the group of several test results from the lot , Tu is the upper or maximum tolerance limit permitted by the specifications , TL is the lower or minimum tolerance limit permitted by the specifications , and To is the test value of the test which deviates from the specifications , F is price reduction factor to be applied for each element as shown in the following table : 35 105.03 TABLE OF PRICE REDUCTION FACTORS Element Factor “ F ” 100 percent size sieve 1 12.5 mm ( ½ '' ) sieve and larger 1 150 μm ( No .

In cases where one or more elements show a positive P value , such positive values will be added and the resulting sum will be used to determine whether the material is in conformity .
If the total P value is between 3 and 25 , the Engineer may require correction or may accept the material at a reduced price .
If P is greater than 25 , the Engineer may : ( 1 ) require complete removal and replacement with specification material at no additional cost to the Department ; ( 2 ) require corrective action to bring the material into conformity at no additional cost to the Department ; or ( 3 ) where the finished product is found to be capable of performing the intended purpose and the value of the finished product is not affected , permit the Contractor to leave the material in place with an appropriate price reduction to be based on engineering evaluation but not to be less than that which would have occurred had a reduction been made where P = 25 .
If the P for aggregate gradation for Items 206 , 304 , or the gradation of hydrated lime for item 403 is 3 or greater the reduction will apply to the contract price multiplied by the Multipliers ( M ) listed in the following table : 36 105.03 Multiplier for Price Reductions for Miscellaneous Items Item Number-Name Element Multiplier ( M ) 206- Structural Backfill Gradation 0.60 304-Aggregate Base Course Gradation 0.60 403-Hot Mix Asphalt * Hydrated Lime Gradation 0.60 * The P value for hydrated lime shall be applied to the price of the HMA item when asphalt cement is not paid for separately .
Lime gradation P values will not be combined with Pay Factors for other elements .
Multiplier for HMA Price Reductions Where Asphalt Cement is not paid for separately : Item Number-Name Element Multiplier ( M ) 403-Stone Matrix Asphalt Gradation , Asphalt Cement Content , or Compaction 0.60 403-Hot Mix Asphalt * Hydrated Lime Gradation 0.60 * The P value for hydrated lime shall be applied to the price of the HMA item .
Lime gradation P values will not be combined with Pay Factors for other elements .
The following equation shows how the Multiplier is used to determine the price reduction .
Price reduction = ( P/100 ) • Multiplier • Price per Unit • Quantity .
If no multiplier is listed no adjustment to the computed P is required .
This is equivalent to a multiplier of one .
Price reduction for those elements which are not included in the Table of Price Reduction Factors will be determined by the Engineer .
The Contractor will not have the option of accepting a price reduction in lieu of producing specification material .
Continued production of non-specification material will not be permitted .
Material which is obviously defective may be isolated and rejected without regard to sampling sequence or location within a lot .
( a ) Retroreflectivity of Modified Epoxy Pavement Pavement Marking .
Retroreflectivity of Modified Epoxy Pavement Pavement Marking shall be tested as follows : 1 .
The Contractor shall take retroreflectivity readings on all modified epoxy pavement marking lines for each mile of roadway striping on the project .

The Contractor shall use a Contractor-furnished retroreflectometer conforming to ASTM E 1710 or AASHTO TP111 .
The retroreflectormeter shall be calibrated , tested and operated in accordance with manufacturer recommendations .
The Contractor shall take 10 retroreflectivity readings within the test section for each stripe .
These 10 readings shall be taken approximately 40 feet apart , and shall be averaged to determine the retroreflectivity of that test section of striping .
In cases where striping is less than 500 feet long , 10 readings shall be taken in 10 equal intervals .
2 .
The calibration for the retroreflectometer shall be verified every day , prior to the readings being taken .
The retroreflectivity readings shall be taken in the presence of the Engineer no sooner than 3 days and no later than 14 days after the marking is tack free .
Traffic control required for retroreflectivity readings shall be included in the cost of the work .
Initial minimum retroreflectivity reading ( mcd/m2/lux ) in a one mile line section of pavement marking paint shall be 400 for white and 250 for yellow .
The pay factor for Modified Epoxy Pavement Marking which is allowed to remain in place at a reduced price shall be according to the following table and shall be applied to the unit bid price for Item 627 , Modified Epoxy Pavement Marking : Color Retroreflectivity Reading ( R ) in a 1-mile section ( mcd/m2/lux ) Pay Factor ( Percent ) for the entire 1-mile section White R > 400 100 375 ≤ R < 400 85 350 ≤ R < 375 75 325 ≤ R < 350 60 300 ≤ R < 325 50 R < 300 Remove and replace Yellow R > 250 100 225 ≤ R < 250 85 200 ≤ R < 225 75 175 ≤ R < 200 60 150 ≤ R < 175 50 R < 150 Remove and replace 38 105.03 3 .
Prior to taking retroreflectivity readings , the Contractor shall remove at the retroreflectivity reading locations any excess beads placed during marking application .
( b ) Violation of Working Time Limitation .
If there is a violation of the working time limitations for traffic control as set forth in the special provisions , a written notice to stop work will be imposed on the Contractor at the start of the next working day .
Work shall not resume until the Contractor assures the Engineer , in writing , that there will not be a reoccurrence of the working time violation .
If more violations take place , the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing that there will be a price reduction charge for each incident in accordance with this specification .
This incident price reduction charge will be deducted from any money due the Contractor .
This price reduction will not be considered a penalty but will be a price reduction for failure to perform traffic control in compliance with the Contract .
An incident is any violation up to 30 minutes in duration .
Each 30 minutes or increment thereof will be considered as an incident .
A price reduction will be assessed for each successive or cumulative 30 minute period in violation of the working time limitations , as determined by the Engineer .
The price reduction for each incident will increase at a progressive rate starting with $ 150 for the second incident and increasing to $ 1200 for the fifth and subsequent incidents in accordance with the following schedule .
A 15 minute grace period will be allowed at the beginning of the second incident on the project before the price reduction is applied .
This 15 minute grace period applies only to the second incident .
The number of incident charges will be accumulative throughout the duration of the Contract. . PRICE REDUCTION SCHEDULE Incident Incident Rate Total Price Reduction 1st Notice to Stop Work -- -- 2nd $ 150 $ 150 3rd 300 450 4th 600 1,050 5th 1,200 2,250 6th 1,200 3,450 Etc .

Asphalt binders will be price reduced according to the following if the requirements of subsection 702.01 are not met : TABLE OF PERFORMANCE GRADED BINDER LIMITS Property Specification Compliance Limit for Price Reduction of 0 % Rejection Limit , Price Reduction = 25 % G * sin ( delta ) of RTFO Residue 2.20 Min 1.87 Min < 1.53 Slope ( m-value ) of the Creep Curve at Low Grade Temperature + 10° C. 0.300 Min 0.295 Min < 0.266 Stiffness of the PAV Residue at Low Grade Temperature + 10° C , ( Mpa ) 300 Max 311 Max > 355 The price reduction will be 25 percent at the rejection limit .
Between the compliance limit and the rejection limit , the price reduction will be calculated as follows : PR = 25 ● CL – test value CL – RL Where : PR = Price Reduction CL = Compliance Limit RL = Rejection Limit ( a ) The price reductions will be cumulative if more than one PG binder property specified in the Table of Performance Graded Binder Limits is out of specification , resulting in P ( total ) .
When binder is included in the contract unit price for HMA , the price reduction will be calculated as follows : Amount of Reduction = [ P ( total ) ] ● [ ( 1/100 ) ● ( Invoice Price for PG Binder ) ] When the binder is paid for separately , the total price reduction will be calculated as follows : Amount of Reduction = [ P ( total ) ] ● [ ( 1/100 ) ● ( Contract Unit Price for PG Binder ) ] 40 105.05 ( b ) Price reductions based on the “ F ” factors in the Table of Price Reduction Factors described in subsection 105.03 will be in addition to the PG binder price reductions .
Other binder requirements listed in the Table of Performance Graded Binder Limits but not price reduced in subsections 105.03 or 105.04 may be tested , but will not be considered for price reduction calculations .
However , the Contractor will not be allowed to continue to produce mix with out of specification PG binder .
If two consecutive samples fail to meet all requirements listed in the Table of Performance Graded Binder Limits , the Contractor shall take corrective action before being allowed to continue production of Hot Mix Asphalt .
If proper corrective measures can not be readily determined , the Engineer will suspend the use of such material until the Engineer can determine from laboratory tests that the Contractor can provide material that is in compliance with the Table of Performance Graded Binder Limits .
( c ) The Contractor will not have the option of accepting a price reduction in lieu of producing specification material .
Continued production of non- specification material will not be permitted .
Material which is obviously defective may be isolated and rejected without regard to sampling sequence or location within a lot .
Conformity to the Contract of Hot Mix Asphalt .
Conformity to the Contract of all Hot Mix Asphalt , Item 403 , except Hot Mix Asphalt ( Patching ) and temporary pavement will be determined by tests and evaluations of elements that include asphalt content , gradation , in-place density , and joint density in accordance with the following : All work performed and all materials furnished shall conform to the lines , grades , cross sections , dimensions , and material requirements , including tolerances , shown in the Contract .
When the Engineer finds the materials or work furnished , work performed , or the finished product are not in conformity with the Contract and has resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory product , the work or material shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected at the expense of the Contractor .
Materials will be sampled randomly and tested by the Department in accordance with subsection 106.05 and with the applicable procedures contained in the Department ’ s Field Materials Manual .
The approximate maximum quantity represented by each sample will be as set forth in subsection 106.05 .
Additional samples may be selected and tested as set forth in subsection 106.05 at the Engineer ’ s discretion .
A process will consist of either a single test value or a series of values resulting from related tests of an element of the Contractor ’ s work and materials .
An element is a material or workmanship property that can be tested and evaluated for quality level by the Department approved sampling , testing , and analytical procedures .
All materials produced will be assigned to a process .
A change in process is defined as a change that affects the element involved .
For any element , with the exception of the joint density element , a process normally will include all produced materials associated with that element prior to a change in the job mix 41 105.05 formula ( Form 43 ) .
For joint density , a new process will be established for each new layer of pavement or for changes in joint construction .
Density measurements taken within each compaction test section will be a separate process .
The Engineer may separate a process in order to accommodate small quantities or unusual variations .
Evaluation of materials for pay factors ( PF ) will be done using only the Department ’ s acceptance test results .
Each process will have a PF computed in accordance with the requirements of this Section .
Test results determined to have sampling or testing errors will not be used .
Except for density measurements taken within a compaction test section , any test result for an element greater than the distance 2 times V ( see Table 105-2 ) outside the tolerance limits will be designated as a separate process and the pay factor will be calculated in accordance with subsection 105.05 ( a ) .
A pay factor less than zero shall be zero .
The calculated PF will be used to determine the Incentive or Disincentive Payment ( I/DP ) for the process .
In the case of in-place density or joint density , the Contractor will be allowed to core the exact location ( or immediately adjacent location for joint density ) of a test result more than 2 times V outside the tolerance limit .
The core must be taken and furnished to the Engineer within eight hours after notification by the Engineer of the test result .
The result of this core will be used in lieu of the previous test result .
Cores not taken within eight hours after notification by the Engineer will not be used in lieu of the test result .
All costs associated with coring shall be at the Contractor ’ s expense .
( a ) Representing Small Quantities .
When it is necessary to represent a process by only one or two test results , PF will be the average of PFs resulting from the following : If the test result is within the tolerance limits then PF = 1.00 If the test result is above the maximum specified limit , then PF = 1.00 – [ 0.25 ( TO – TU ) /V ] If the test result is below the minimum specified limit , then PF = 1.00 – [ 0.25 ( TL – TO ) /V ] Where : PF = pay factor .
V = V factor from Table 105-2 .
TO = the individual test result .
TU = upper specification limit .
TL = lower specification limit .
The calculated PF will be used to determine the I/DP for the process .
( b ) Determining Quality Level .
Each process with three or more test results will be evaluated for a quality level ( QL ) in accordance with Colorado Procedure 71 .
42 105.05 ( c ) Gradation Element .
Each specified sieve , with the exception of 100 percent passing sieves , will be evaluated for QL separately .
The lowest calculated QL for a sieve will be designated as the QL for gradation element for the process .
( d ) Joint Density Element .
Joint Density will be tested according to subsection 401.17 .
( e ) Process Pay Factor .
Using the calculated QL for the process , compute the PF as follows : The final number of random samples ( Pn ) in each process will determine the final pay factor .
As test values are accumulated for each process , Pn will change accordingly .
When the process has been completed , the number of random samples it contains will determine the computation of PF , based on Table 105-3 and formula ( 1 ) below .
When Pn is from 3 to 9 , or greater than 200 , PF will be computed using the formulas designated in Table 105-3 .
Where Pn is equal to or greater than 10 and less than 201 , PF will be computed by Formula ( 1 ) : ) ( ) ( 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 Pn Pn Pn Pn PF PF PF PF PF PF PF X − − •     + − + + + = Formula ( 1 ) Where , when referring to Table 105-3 : PF1= PF determined at the next lowest Pn formula using process QL PF2= PF determined using the Pn formula shown for the process QL PF3= PF determined at the next highest Pn formula using process QL Pn2= the lowest Pn in the spread of values listed for the process Pn formula Pn3= the lowest Pn in the spread of values listed for the next highest Pn formula Pnx= the actual number of test values in the process When evaluating the item of Furnish Hot Mix Asphalt , the PF for the element of In-Place Density shall be 1.0 .
Regardless of QL , the maximum PF in relation to Pn is limited in accordance with Table 105-3 .
As test results become available , they will be used to calculate QL and PF numbers for each process .
The process I/DPs will then be calculated and accumulated for each element and for the item .
The test results and the accumulated calculations will be made available to the Contractor upon request .
Numbers from the calculations will be carried to significant figures and rounded according to AASHTO Standard Recommended Practice R-11 , Rounding Method .
( f ) Evaluation of Work .
When the PF of a process is 0.75 or greater , the finished quantity of work represented by the process will be accepted at the appropriate pay factor .
If the PF is less than 0.75 , the Engineer may : 43 105.05 ( 1 ) Require complete removal and replacement with specification material at the Contractor ’ s expense ; or ( 2 ) Where the finished product is found to be capable of performing the intended purpose and the value of the finished product is not affected , permit the Contractor to leave the material in place .
If the material is permitted to remain in place , the PF for the process will not be greater than 0.75 .
When condition red , as described in subsection 106.05 ( g ) , exists for any element , resolution and correction will be in accordance with Section 106 .
Material which the Engineer determines is defective may be isolated and rejected without regard to sampling sequence or location within a process .
If removal and replacement is required because the joint density PF for a process is below 0.75 , the Contractor shall remove and replace the full lane width adjacent to and including at least 6 inches beyond the visible joint line for the entire length of joint representing the process .
If the lane removed is adjacent to another joint , that joint shall also be removed to a point 6 inches beyond the visible joint line .
When a single joint density core is more than 2V outside the tolerance limits , the removal and replacement limits shall be identified by coring the failing joint at 25 foot intervals until two successive cores are found to be 1V or less below the minimum tolerance limit .
If removal and replacement is required , the Contractor shall submit documentation identifying the process to be used to correct the area in question in writing .
The process will be approved by the Engineer before commencing the corrective work .

Delays in delivery of materials or fabrication scheduling resulting from late ordering , financial considerations , or other causes that could have been foreseen or prevented will be considered nonexcusable delays .
However , delays caused by fuel shortage or delay in delivery of materials to the Contractor due to some unusual market condition caused by industry‑wide strike , national disaster , area‑wide shortage , or other reasons beyond the control of the Contractor which prevent procurement of materials or fuel within the allowable contract time limits will be considered excusable delays .
( d ) Extension of Contract Time .
The Contractor ’ s assertion that insufficient contract time was specified is not a valid reason for an extension of contract time .
For time extension requests , the Contractor shall provide a two-part submittal : part one shall consist of a written notice of the delay and part two shall consist of the Contractor ’ s delay documentation and supporting analysis .
Part 1 : The Contractor shall provide the written notice of delay within seven days of the delay occurrence .
The notice shall describe the delay and include documentation substantiating the nature and cause of the delay .
Failure to submit the written notice constitutes a waiver of entitlement to additional time or compensation .
Part 2 : This shall be submitted within 30 days of the written notice .
The Contractor shall include all documentation needed to support the time extension request .
In order to request additional contract time for an unexpected delay , the Contractor shall provide a contemporaneous schedule analysis in accordance with subsection 108.03 .
The schedule analysis shall show that the delayed activity or activities were on the critical path or became critical due to the delay .
The Engineer will base a determination of an allowable contract time extension on : ( 1 ) The current Schedule in effect at the time of the alleged delay ; ( 2 ) The supporting documentation submitted by the Contractor ; ( 3 ) The contemporaneous schedule analysis ; and 153 108.09 ( 4 ) Any other relevant information available to the Engineer .
For a time extension request resulting from a change order , the Contractor shall demonstrate the delay to the project completion date by : ( 1 ) Inserting a fragnet containing the change order activities into an unprogressed copy of the schedule that is current at the time of the change order ; ( 2 ) Tying the fragnet into the schedule logic ; and ( 3 ) Recalculating the schedule .
The Department will not consider delays to activities which do not affect the performance period of the Contract as a basis for a Contract time extension .
If the Engineer grants a contract time extension , the revised Contract Completion date will be in effect as though it were the original contract date .
A Contractor ’ s failure to have an approved , or approved with comments , current project schedule in place will preclude the Department from considering a Contractor ’ s time extension request .
Failure to Complete Work on Time .
A daily charge will be made against the Contractor for each calendar day , including free time , that any work remains uncompleted after the elapse of contract time .
This daily charge will be deducted from any money due the Contractor .
This deduction will not be considered a penalty , but as liquidated damages .
The schedule of liquidated damages set forth below is an amount , agreed to by the Contractor and the Department , as reasonably representing additional construction engineering costs incurred by the Department if the Contractor fails to complete performance within the contract time .
The schedule of liquidated damages will be : Original Contract Amount ( $ ) Liquidated Damages per Calendar Day ( $ ) From More Than To And Including 0 150,000 500 150,000 500,000 1,000 500,000 1,000,000 1,600 1,000,000 2,000,000 2,300 2,000,000 4,000,000 4,100 4,000,000 10,000,000 5,800 10,000,000 -- -- 7,000 Due account shall be taken of any adjustment of the contract time for completion of the work granted under the provisions of subsection 108.07 .
154 108.10 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part thereof after elapse of contract time will not operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights under the Contract .
Deductions assessed as liquidated damages under this subsection shall not relieve the Contractor from liability for any damages or costs resulting from delays to other contractors on the project or other projects caused by a failure of the assessed Contractor to complete the work according to contract times .
Default of Contract .
( a ) The Engineer may send a written notice of intent to find the Contractor in default to the Contractor and the Surety by certified mail for any of the reasons listed below .
The notice will describe the conditions causing the impending default , advise them of the actions required for remedy , and state that if the conditions have not been corrected within ten days of receipt of the notice , CDOT will find the Contractor in default .
The Department may send a written notice of intent under this part ( a ) if the Contractor : ( 1 ) Fails to begin the Contract work within the time specified to begin work , or ( 2 ) Fails to perform the Contract work with sufficient resources to assure its timely completion , or ( 3 ) Discontinues the Contract work , or ( 4 ) Fails to resume discontinued Contract work , or ( 5 ) Becomes insolvent , is declared bankrupt , commits an act of bankruptcy or insolvency , allows a final judgment to remain unsatisfied for a period of ten calendar days , makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors , or ( 6 ) Fails to comply with the Contract regarding minimum wage payments , DBE requirements , or EEO requirements , or ( 7 ) Is a party to fraud .
If the Contractor fails to correct the conditions identified in the notice of intent to find the Contractor in default within ten calendar days of receipt , the Department may serve the Contractor with an immediate notice of default and take prosecution of the work from the Contractor .
Copies of the default notice will also be sent , by certified mail , to the Contractor and the Surety .
( b ) The Engineer may send a written notice of intent to find the Contractor in default to the Contractor and the Surety by certified mail for the reason listed below .
The notice will include a stop work order which will require the Contractor to cease work on the Contract Items that are unacceptable .
The notice will describe the conditions causing the impending default , advise the Contractor of the actions required for remedy and state that if the conditions have not been corrected within ten days of receipt of the notice , CDOT will find the Contractor in default .
155 108.11 The Department may send a written notice of intent under this part ( b ) if the Contractor fails to perform the work to Contract requirements or neglects or refuses to correct or remove and replace rejected materials or unacceptable work .
The Contractor shall not resume work on the unacceptable Contract Items until the following conditions have been met : ( 1 ) The Contractor shall submit a written proposal to the Engineer outlining the procedures which will be followed by the Contractor to correct the unacceptable conditions , and ; ( 2 ) The Engineer and the Contractor shall meet to discuss the written proposal , and ; ( 3 ) The Engineer will issue written permission for the Contractor to commence work .
If the Contractor fails to meet these three conditions within ten calendar days of receipt of the notice of intent to find the Contractor in default , or if at any time after the Contractor resumes work , the work does not meet Contract requirements or the Contractor again neglects or refuses to correct or remove and replace rejected materials or unacceptable work , the Department may serve the Contractor with an immediate notice of default and take prosecution of the work from the Contractor .
Copies of the default notice will also be sent , by certified mail , to the Contractor and the Surety .
( c ) In the case of default under either subsection 108.10 ( a ) or 108.10 ( b ) : ( 1 ) The Department will revoke the Contractor ’ s Prequalification .
If the Department chooses to rebid the remaining Contract work on this project , the Contractor will not be allowed to submit a bid for this work .
( 2 ) The Department may appropriate or use materials at the project site and contract with others to complete the remaining Contract work .
( 3 ) The Department will determine the methods used for completion of the Contract .
( 4 ) Resulting costs and charges incurred by the Department will be deducted from payments owed the Contractor .
If such costs exceed the payment owed the Contractor , the Contractor and Surety shall reimburse the Department for these costs .
These costs and charges may include but are not limited to : cost of Contract completion , including designing , advertising , bidding and awarding the remaining work and liquidated damages or disincentives .
( d ) If the notice of default is determined to be in error , the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the Contract had been terminated in accordance with Subsection 108.10 .
Damages for improper notice of default may be awarded accordingly .
Termination of Contract .
( a ) Termination Notice .
The Department may terminate work under the Contract 156 108.11 in whole or in part if the Engineer determines that termination is in the Department ’ s best interest .
Contract termination will be initiated by the Engineer ’ s written Contract Termination Notice to the Contractor .

( d ) Payment .
Subject to subsection 108.11 ( c ) above , the Contractor and Engineer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid to the Contractor because of the termination .
The amount may include reasonable cancellation charges incurred by the Contractor .
The amount may also include any reasonable loss upon outstanding commitments for subcontracts which the Contractor is unable to cancel , provided the Contractor has made reasonable effort to divert the commitments to other activities .
The amount agreed upon shall be embodied in a Contract Modification Order and the Contractor shall be paid that amount .
Payments claimed and agreed to pursuant to termination shall be based on the Contract unit prices .
Payment for partially completed lump sum items may be made in the proportion that the partially completed work is to the total lump sum item .
Where work performed is of a nature that it is impossible to separate the costs of uncompleted work from completed units , the Contractor will be paid the actual cost incurred for the necessary preparatory work and other work accomplished .
The Department may from time to time , under terms and conditions it may prescribe , make partial payments against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the contract termination .
The total of such payments shall not exceed the amount , as determined by the Engineer , the Contractor will be 157 108.11 entitled to hereunder .
( e ) Disposition of Work and Inventory .

( f ) Cost Records .
The Contractor agrees to make cost records available to the extent necessary to determine the validity and amount of each item claimed .
( g ) Contractual Responsibilities .
Termination of a Contract or portion thereof shall not relieve the Contractor of contractual responsibilities for the work completed , nor shall it relieve the Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claim arising out of the work performed .
158 109.01 SECTION 109 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT Measurement of Quantities .
All work completed under the Contract will be measured by the Engineer according to United States standard measure ( English units ) .
A station when used as a definition or term of measurement will be 100 linear feet .
The method of measurement and computations to be used in determination of quantities of material furnished and of work performed under the Contract will be those methods generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice .
Unless otherwise specified , longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made horizontally , and deductions will not be made for individual structures having an area of 9 square feet or less .
Unless otherwise specified , transverse measurements for area computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or as ordered in writing by the Engineer .
Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as altered to fit field conditions .
Items which are measured by linear foot , such as pipe culverts , guardrail , underdrains , etc. , will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which the structures are placed , unless otherwise shown on the plans .
In computing volumes of excavation and embankment , the average end area method or the method incorporated into the Department ’ s computer earthwork program will be used .
The term “ gage , ” when used in connection with the measurement of plates , will mean the U.S. Standard Gage .
When the term “ gage ” refers to the measurement of wire , it will mean the wire gage specified in ASTM A510 .
The term “ ton ” will mean the short ton consisting of 2000 pounds avoirdupois .
Materials measured or proportioned by weight shall be weighed on accurate scales .
Scales shall be accurate within the allowable tolerances as prescribed by State law .
The scales shall be tested for accuracy by the Colorado Department of Agriculture or an approved Colorado Department of Agriculture vendor ( https : //www.colorado.gov/pacific/aginspection/scale-companies ) at least once each year , each time the scales are relocated , and as often as the Engineer may deem necessary .
Scales shall be furnished by the Contractor or the Contractor may utilize commercial scales .
Scales shall be operated according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture ’ s regulations .
Weighers , scales , scale tickets , scale house , and verification of the 159 109.01 scales ’ accuracy will not be measured and paid for separately , but shall be included in the work .
The Contractor may use either certified hopper scales or certified platform scales .
When platform scales are used to weigh vehicles carrying material paid for by weight , each vehicle shall be weighed by a certified weigher .
Hopper scales used to directly measure material paid for by weight shall be operated by certified weighers and provide an accurate net weight .
The operator of each vehicle carrying material measured and paid for by weight shall obtain a scale ticket ( certificate of correct weight ) from the certified weigher and deliver the ticket to the Engineer at the point of delivery of the material .
The scale ticket shall include the following information : ( 1 ) Project Number .
( 2 ) Date .
( 3 ) Ticket Number .
( 4 ) Haul Unit Number .
( 5 ) Gross Weight .

The Contractor shall furnish to the Engineer , in writing , a vehicle identification sheet that lists the following for each delivery vehicle to be used on the project : ( 1 ) Identification mark .
( 2 ) Vehicle length .
( 3 ) Tare weight .
( 4 ) Number of axles .
( 5 ) The distance between extreme axles .
( 6 ) Information related to legal weight , including the Permit No .
and permitted weight of each vehicle for which the State has issued an overweight permit .
This information shall be furnished prior to time of delivery of the material and at any subsequent time the Contractor changes vehicles , combination vehicles , axle length relationships , or overweight permitting of vehicles .
Weighers using hopper scales solely for batching materials not measured and paid for by weight need not be certified .
The Engineer will randomly verify the accuracy of the certified weigher on every 160 109.01 project where the weights are manually entered on the scale ticket .
This verification will consist of at least one comparison check on the project .
Additional verification checks may be required as determined by the Engineer .
The Engineer will randomly select a loaded truck after the truck has been issued a scale ticket by the certified weigher .
The loaded truck will then be reweighed , in the presence of the Engineer , on the same scale and the weight compared with the weight on the scale ticket .
Reweighed loads shall be within the tolerance of 200 pounds plus or minus .
The Engineer will also verify the accuracy of computerized scales .
Computerized scales are scales that automatically print weights on the scale ticket .
This verification will consist of at least one comparison check when the project requires more than 2500 tons of material to be weighed .
This comparison check shall be made by reweighing a loaded vehicle .
The Contractor shall either provide a second certified scale or select a second certified scale in the vicinity to be used for the comparison check .
Comparison checks shall be performed using the following procedures : ( 1 ) Hopper Scale .
A loaded truck will be randomly selected by the Engineer .
The loaded truck shall be weighed on a certified platform scale to record the gross weight .
The truck shall be unloaded and weighed again on the same scale to record the tare weight .
The tare weight shall be subtracted from the gross weight and compared against the net weight recorded on the scale ticket .
( 2 ) Platform Scales .
A loaded truck will be randomly selected by the Engineer .
The loaded truck shall be reweighed on a second certified scale and the gross weight shall be compared against the gross weight on the first scale ticket .
Should a comparison check reveal a weight difference of more than one percent , a second comparison check shall be performed immediately .
If the weight differences of both comparison checks exceed the one percent limit , the Contractor shall immediately stop weighing and the scale shall be recertified and resealed at the Contractor ’ s expense .
The necessary adjustments as indicated by the recertification will be made to all scale tickets issued since the last certification or on the entire project , whichever occurred later , unless the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the defect in the scale was present for a lesser period of time .
If it is necessary to recertify a scale , and more than 2500 tons of material remain to be weighed , another scale comparison check shall be made .
All comparison checks shall be made at the Contractor ’ s expense .
Materials to be measured by volume in the hauling vehicle shall be hauled in approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of delivery .
Vehicles for this purpose may be of any size or type , provided the body is shaped so the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined .
All vehicles shall be loaded to their water level capacity and all loads shall be leveled when the vehicles arrive at the point of delivery .
161 109.01 Water used in the work will be measured by the M Gallon or 1000 U.S. Gallons .
The weight of inherent moisture in the material will not be deducted .
Water added for the Contractor ’ s convenience will not be paid for .
Water may be measured either by volume or weight .
Water meters shall be accurate within a range of ± 3 percent .
When water is metered , the Contractor shall use an approved metering device and shall furnish the Engineer a certificate showing the meter has been accurately calibrated within the time allowed in the following schedule : 2 inch 4 years 4 inch to 6 inch 2 years 8 inch to 10 inch 1 year Water meters shall be calibrated when the Engineer determines there is reason to believe the meters are not accurate within the allowable tolerance .
If water meter accuracy is found acceptable , the cost involved in checking the water meter shall be at the Department ’ s expense .
If the water meter accuracy is found unsatisfactory , the cost involved in checking the water meter shall be at the Contractor ’ s expense .
For those materials specified to be measured by the cubic yard , an acceptable method of computing volumes of excavation is to determine a weight to volume factor and convert weight to volumes by means of the factor .
The weight to volume factor shall be determined by Colorado Procedure 80 as described in the Department ’ s Field Materials Manual .
The number of tests used to determine the material weight to volume factor will be determined by the Engineer .
The locations where the tests are taken shall be at those locations specified in the “ Method of Measurement ” for the particular bid item ; i.e. , Unclassified Excavation - in its original position : Embankment Material - in its final compacted position , etc .
Asphalt materials will be measured by the gallon or ton .
Volumes will be measured at 60 ˚F or will be corrected to the volume at 60 ˚F using ASTM D 1250 for asphalts or ASTM D 633 for tars .
Net certified scale weight or weight based on certified volumes in the case of rail shipments will be used as a basis of measurement , subject to correction when asphalt material has been lost from the car or the distributor , wasted , or otherwise not incorporated in the work .
When asphalt materials are shipped by truck or transport , net certified weight or volume subject to correction for loss or foaming will be used for computing quantities .
Cement will be measured by the ton .
Timber will be measured by the number of thousand feet board measure or MFBM actually incorporated in the structure .
Measurement will be based on nominal commercial widths and thicknesses .
The term “ lump sum ” when used as an item of payment will mean complete payment for the work described in the Contract .
162 109.03 When a complete structure or structural unit ( in effect , “ lump sum ” work ) is specified as the unit of measurement , the unit will include all necessary fittings and accessories .
Rental of equipment will be measured in hours of actual working time and necessary traveling time of the equipment within the limits of the project .
If special equipment has been ordered by the Engineer in connection with force account work , travel time and transportation to the project will be measured .
If equipment has been ordered held on the job on a standby basis by the Engineer , and is not otherwise utilized by the Contractor , standby rental rates for the equipment will be paid at the rates specified in subsection 109.04 .
When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence , wire , plates , rolled shapes , pipe conduit , etc. , and these items are identified by gage , unit weight , section dimensions , etc. , the identification will be considered to be nominal weight or dimensions .
Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications , manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted .
Scope of Payment .
The Contractor shall receive and accept compensation provided for in the Contract as full payment for furnishing all materials and for performing all work under the Contract in a complete and acceptable manner and for all risk , loss , damage , or expense of whatever character arising out of the nature of the work or the prosecution thereof , subject to the provisions of subsection 107.21 .

If the area represented by the failing sample contains more than 2000 tons of the new pavement , then the material from the area represented by the failing sample will be sampled and tested according to the following method : Pavement samples for possible moisture susceptibility testing will be taken at a minimum frequency of once every 2000 tons throughout the project .
The Engineer will observe the sampling , take possession of the samples , and retain these samples for possible testing .
Sample size shall be a minimum of 20 pounds .
If a 10,000 ton sample fails then the four 2000 ton samples from the area represented by that failing 10,000 ton sample will be tested for moisture susceptibility .
The 10,000 ton result and the four 2,000 ton results will be considered a lot of five and will be evaluated according to the formulas and procedures in subsection 105.03 .
If less than four retained samples are on hand because the 10,000 ton sample represents less than 8000 tons of hot mix asphalt , the price adjustment will be based on the test results from the retained samples on hand plus the test result from the 10,000 ton sample .
For the above evaluation the “ F ” factor used in calculating P factors shall be 2.5 .
The P value shall be applied to price of the HMA item .
If asphalt cement is not paid for separately the price reduction shall be multiplied by 0.60 .

Hybrid MSE Wall Systems .
A hybrid system is one which combines elements of both externally and internally stabilized systems .
An externally stabilized system uses a physical structure to hold the retained soil .
The stabilizing forces of this system are mobilized either through the weight of a 403 504.09 shape stable structure or through the restraints provided by the embedment of wall into the soil , if needed , plus the tieback forces of anchorages .
An internally stabilized system involves reinforced soils to retain fills and sustain loads .
Reinforcement may be added to either the selected fills as earth walls or to the retained earth directly to form a more coherent stable slope .
These reinforcements can either be layered reinforcements installed during the bottom-to- top construction of selected fills , or be driven piles or drilled caissons built into the retained soil .
All this reinforcement must be oriented properly and extend beyond the potential failure mass .
Hybrid MSE wall systems may be used unless otherwise noted on the plans .

For the continuous method , a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flange shall be heated simultaneously ; the strip shall be of sufficient width and 436 509.19 temperature to obtain the required curvature .
For the V-type heating , the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in truncated triangular wedge- shaped areas having their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange ; the spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the required curvature , and heating shall progress along the top and bottom flange at approximately the same rate .
For the V-type heating , the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface shall terminate just before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached .
To avoid unnecessary web distortion , special care shall be taken when heating the inside flange surfaces ( the surfaces that intersect the web ) so the heat is not applied directly to the web .

When the radius of curvature is 1000 feet or more , the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than 1000 feet , the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend past the web for a distance equal to ⅛ of the flange or 3 inches , whichever is less .

Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is only mandatory when the flange thickness is 1¼ inches or greater , in which case , the two surfaces shall be heated concurrently .
The minimum temperature shall be as prescribed below .
Preload compressive stresses will be permitted up to a maximum of 60 percent of the specified yield strength of the steel to reduce the number of heat patterns required to produce the desired curvature .
Loading that causes the member to distort permanently ( yield without the application of heat ) will result in rejection of the member .
All nondestructive testing to evaluate damage and corrective work ordered by the Engineer to compensate for overstressing shall be performed at the Contractor 's expense .
3 .
Temperature .

4 .
Position for Heating .
The girder may be heat curved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
When curved in the vertical position , the girder must be braced or supported in such a manner that the 437 509.19 tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heat curving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
When curved in the horizontal position , the girder must be supported near its ends and at intermediate points , if required , to obtain a uniform curvature ; the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder must not exceed the usual allowable design stress .
When the girder is positioned horizontally for heating , intermediate safety catch blocks must be maintained at the midlength of the girder within 2 inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the girder in the vertical position by measuring off-sets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by using other suitable means .

When longitudinal stiffeners are required , they shall be heat curved , or oxygen-cut to the required radius prior to being welded to the curved girder .
The girder shall be heat curved in the fabrication shop before it is painted .
When cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams , they may be attached before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than 2½ inches and the radius of curvature is greater than 1000 feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates , the beams must be heat curved before the cover plates are attached ; cover plates must be either heat curved or oxygen-cut separately and then welded to the curved beam .
