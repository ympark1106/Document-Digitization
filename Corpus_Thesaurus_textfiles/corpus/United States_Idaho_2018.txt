These Standard Specifications are written with an emphasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice , someone acts on something .
For example : `` The Contractor will place the concrete . ''
A similar sentence in the passive voice – `` The concrete will be placed '' – would be unclear about who was responsible for placing the concrete .
The Standard Specifications also are written in the imperative mood .
The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
The Department is stating its requirements or directions for the work to the Contractor ; such statements have the same force as if they contained the words '' the Contractor will . ''
In an imperative sentence such as , `` Place the concrete , '' the Department is indicating that it requires the Contractor to place the concrete .
Before contract award , imperative statements are directed to the bidder ( s ) .
After contract award , imperatives are directed to the Contractor .
The Department will identify parties other than the bidder or the Contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in these Standard Specifications .
In phrasings where the responsible party is clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so , the Department may use the passive voice .
All approvals and consents are granted and all direction is given by the Engineer .
All submittals are sent to the Engineer .
101.02 Organization of Specifications .
A .
General .
With the exception of Section 100 “ General Provisions ” and Section 700 “ Materials ” Standard Specification sections are written in a five-part format .
Each section contains the following primary subsections : XXX.01 Description .
XXX.02 Materials .
XXX.03 Construction Requirements .
XXX.04 Method of Measurement .
XXX.05 Basis of Payment .
The subsections contain varying numbers of titled subordinate subsections composed of higher and lower levels .
B .
Hierarchy of Organization .
Subsection requirements apply to subordinate subsections .
In addition , many subsections begin with a lower-level subsection titled General .
General subsection requirements apply to the associated same-level subsections that follow ; they do not apply to the higher level .
C. Title ( or Headings ) .
Sections and subsection titles or headings are for referencing convenience , and do not necessarily bear on the text meaning or interpretation .
14 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction D. References .
The Standard Specifications rely on many internal cross references and to external sources in other contract documents , Department manuals , and other industry resources .
To minimize the text necessary for internal cross references , the Standard Specifications will not precede internal cross references with the terms Section and Subsection .
External cross references will contain just enough information to find the intended source .

D. Acceptance , Rejection , and Payment .
After the Contractor formally submits the complete VECP , the Engineer will accept or reject the VECP within 30 calendar days .
The Engineer will issue a change order that pays the Contractor 50 percent of the net savings amount .
The Engineer will calculate the net savings amount by using the difference between the cost of the proposed changes to the work and the cost of the work as required by the contract , using contract unit prices or other calculated costs .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor for the development , design , and implementation of the VECP .
The Department ’ s estimated cost to evaluate , review , and implement the VECP will not be included in the calculation of net savings .
The Engineer will calculate the incentive payment using the following equation : S = ( A-B ) /2 Where : S = Share in quantifiable cost savings from the VECP .

2 .
Ongoing Contract Involvement .
a .
Contract Documents , Reports , and Information .
The Department will provide each DRB member with the contract , a set of the plans , and the specifications .
To keep the DRB members informed of work activity and other developments , the Department and the Contractor will provide , in a timely manner , relevant information and documentation requested by the DRB .
The DRB may request information and the work documentation that the Department and the Contractor produce in the normal course of construction , including , but not limited to , periodic reports and minutes of progress meetings .
The DRB may not request information or documentation that the Department or the Contractor would not have normally produced .
b .
Periodic Meetings and Site Visits .
The DRB members may visit the project site and meet with representatives of the Department and the Contractor at regular intervals and during significant construction events as agreed to by the Department and the Contractor .
To minimize the time and expense of meetings , the Department and the Contractor may decide to use conference calls , videoconferences , or any other means .

A representative from the Department and the Contractor will accompany the DRB members on project visits .
3 .
Informal Review Process .
The Department and the Contractor may involve the DRB in the review of an emerging dispute .
Use of an informal review by the DRB does not relieve the Department or the Contractor from complying with all contract requirements .
However , if informal review by the DRB is used , the dispute submittal time frames and review time frames of 105.16 may be revised by mutual written agreement of the Department and the Contractor , or if they are unable to agree , will be established by the Department .
At the request of the Department or the Contractor , the DRB is available to provide informal nonbinding preliminary review regarding an emerging dispute .
After a dispute is initially brought before the DRB for informal review , the Department and the Contractor will have sufficient notice and time to prepare for informal review by the DRB .
Upon the request of the Department or the Contractor to the DRB chairperson for an informal DRB review , the chairperson will contact the other DRB members to make necessary arrangements for the review .
Informal review meetings will consist of informal oral discussions with input and comments encouraged from the Department and the Contractor .
After private deliberation , the DRB will provide initial impressions and oral guidance which will be limited to the dispute only and will not offer any opinion as to legal questions .
Minority guidance ( should it exist ) will also be offered .
The DRB will not make written findings and recommendations or any record of the informal review .
The DRB is not bound by its oral recommendations to the Department and the Contractor in the event that a dispute that was considered in informal review by the DRB is later submitted to the DRB for formal review .
It is the intent of the Department and the Contractor to establish informal review by the DRB as a method of dispute mitigation .
To the extent permitted by law , the Department and the Contractor agree that all written or oral communications and documentation submitted and/or discussed during informal review by the DRB will be privileged and confidential pursuant to Idaho Rules of Evidence 507 and 408 .
Rule of Evidence 408 will also apply to all written or oral communications prepared for or exchanged during the informal review process .

The 3 parties may agree to any another location that would be more convenient and still provide the required facilities and access to necessary documentation .
The Department and the Contractor will each have representatives in attendance at all hearings .
The Contractor will make its presentation first .
The Department and the Contractor will take successive turns for rebuttals until all aspects of the dispute are fully covered .
The DRB members , the Department , and the Contractor representatives may ask questions , request clarification , or ask for additional data during the presentations .
For difficult or complex disputes , the DRB may schedule additional hearings to facilitate full consideration and understanding of the information presented by the Department and the Contractor .
The DRB will allow the Department and the Contractor adequate opportunity to present evidence , documentation , and testimony supporting their position regarding all issues of the dispute .
The Department and the Contractor can not present , and the DRB can not consider in its review , any documents , reports , analysis , or other information , unless the same was previously provided to the other party as supporting documentation for the position statement .
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Department and the Contractor , the DRB will limit the position statements , presentations , and reviews to issues of entitlement only .
If the Department and the Contractor agree to the DRB reviewing or giving guidance on issues of entitlement and quantum , the Department and the Contractor will complete their presentations on entitlement before presenting issues of quantum .
A formal transcript of the hearing is usually unnecessary .
The Department or the Contractor may request that the DRB allow recordation and transcription by a court reporter .
The Department and the Contractor will agree on the allocation of the associated cost .
This transcription , if prepared , will not constitute the official record of the DRB review .

If the Department or the Contractor representatives fail to appear before the DRB on the date scheduled for the hearing without justifiable cause , the party that is in attendance will prevail in their position on the dispute .
g. Deliberations .
After the conclusion of the hearing , the DRB members will hold private deliberations to prepare the DRB ’ s findings and recommendations .
The DRB may hold its private deliberations at any location .
The individual views of the DRB members will be kept strictly confidential from disclosure to anyone other than the DRB members .
If necessary , the DRB may submit a written request to the Department and the Contractor that briefly describes the scope and budget for special services ( e.g. , legal , technical , accounting , data research , or other expert assistance , consultation , testimony ) .
If the Department and the Contractor agree to the request , both parties will execute a written agreement with a provider of the necessary special services chosen by mutual agreement .
The DRB ’ s findings and recommendations will not be bound by any information provided by a special service provider .
The Department and the Contractor will share and pay for the cost of the service provider as specified in 105.19.5 .
Typically the special service provider will respond to the DRB ’ s questions in private consultation and the Department and the Contractor may not request a permanent record of the questions or responses .
h. Findings and Recommendations .
The DRB ’ s findings and recommendations concerning any dispute are nonbinding and inadmissible in any subsequent proceeding pursuant to Rule 408 of the Idaho Rules of Evidence .
The DRB is not responsible for resolving disputes ; that responsibility remains with the Department and the Contractor .
The DRB will base its findings and recommendations on the contract , applicable contract law , industry practices , and the facts of the dispute .
The DRB must also evaluate whether the burden of proof has been met .
Within 14 calendar days from completion of the hearing , the DRB will provide the Department and the Contractor with a written copy of its findings and recommendations by certified mail return receipt requested .
For difficult or complex disputes , and in consideration of the DRB ’ s availability , the Department , the Contractor , and the DRB may mutually agree to revise the time requirement .

B .
Use Tax .
The exercise of control over State-owned material by a Contractor who is improving real property ( e.g. , roadways ) will incur the imposition of a use tax by the State .
Contact the Idaho State Tax Commission ( Telephone No .
208-334-7618 ) concerning 63-3609 , Idaho Code and IDAPA 35.01.02.012 and 35.01.02.013 .
For aggregates , the amount of the use tax will differ depending on whether the material is obtained from a State- owned material source or whether it is obtained from a State-owned stockpile .
Use tax is due on the fair market value of the material , and the crushed value ( processed material ) is higher than for unprocessed material .
The use tax will also differ depending on whether a Contractor crushed the material and placed it on the roadway , or if the Contractor only performed one of these operations and hired a subcontractor to perform the other .
If the contractor hires a subcontractor to crush the material , he must pay a sales tax to the crusher for this fabrication 60 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction labor .
If the Contractor crushed and applies the material , or gives material he crushed to a subcontractor for application , the Contractor owes use tax on the royalty value .

108.07 Extension of Contract Time .
A .
General .
The Engineer will extend the contract time by issuing a change order if an excusable delay , as specified in 108.07.B , 108.07.D , or 108.07.F , extends the scheduled substantial completion date .
The Engineer will only consider a request to revise contract time if the following conditions are met : 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 87 of 571 1 .
Notice as specified in 104.03 .
2 .
Documentation from the project schedule , including updates , justifies the time extension .
The Engineer will evaluate the information submitted and determine the time extension , if any .
The Contractor ’ s request that insufficient contract time was specified is not a valid reason for a time extension .
Time is of the essence in the Contractor ’ s performance of the contract .
Delays inconvenience the traveling public , obstruct traffic , interfere with and delay commerce , and increase highway user risk .
Delays also increase the Department ’ s costs , adding time needed for administration , engineering , inspection , and supervision .
It is essential , and in the public ’ s interest , the Contractor work vigorously to contract completion .
Time extensions will not be granted for delays incurred during the months of December , January , and February , unless the Contractor ’ s accepted project schedule shows the delayed work was scheduled to be performed during this time period and was critical at the time of the delay .
If contract time is extended , the Department will relieve the Contractor from associated liquidated damages , as specified in 108.08 .
B. Excusable , Noncompensable Delays .
Excusable , noncompensable delays are delays that are not the Contractor ’ s or the Department ’ s fault or responsibility , and could not have been reasonably foreseen or anticipated by the Contractor before bid .
A time extension will be granted , if justified as specified in 108.07.A , but the Contractor will not be paid for costs incurred due to the delays .
The following are examples of excusable , noncompensable delays : 1 .
Delays due to floods , tornadoes , lightning strikes , earthquakes , or other cataclysmic natural phenomena .
2 .
Weather delay as specified in 108.07.C .
3 .

Delays due to the Contractor ’ s and its subcontractors or suppliers , insolvency , or mismanagement are not excusable .
4 .
Delays due to civil disturbances .
5 .
Delays from fires or epidemics .
6 .
Delays from labor strikes that are beyond the Contractor ’ s , its subcontractor ’ s , or supplier ’ s power to settle and are not caused by the Contractor ’ s , its subcontractor ’ s , or supplier ’ s improper acts or omissions .
7 .
Added quantities that delay work on the critical path .
8 .
Delays due to acts of the government or a political subdivision other than the Department .
9 .
Delays from damage to temporary or permanent work .
C. Extension to the Contract Time for Weather .
For calendar day and completion date contracts , the contract time will be extended 1 day for each lost critical path work day caused by weather that exceeds the reasonably anticipated weather days per month as listed in Table 108.07-1 .
88 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Table 108.07-1 – Anticipated Weather Days per Month Number of Working Days Lost Due to Weather by District Month D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 January 10 7 8 8 8 8 February 7 6 6 6 6 6 March 7 6 6 6 6 6 April 5 6 4 4 4 4 May 5 6 4 5 5 5 June 4 4 2 3 3 3 July 1 1 1 1 1 1 August 1 1 1 1 1 1 September 2 1 1 1 1 1 October 4 3 2 1 1 1 November 9 6 6 5 5 5 December 11 7 7 7 7 7 Weather experienced on weekends or holidays will not be considered as lost working days , unless the Contractor normally works on those days or if directed to work on those days .
D. Excusable , Compensable Delays .
Excusable , compensable delays are delays that are caused only by the Department .
The contract time will be extended for the following excusable , compensable delays , if the conditions specified in 108.07.A are met : 1 .
Delays due to contract revisions as defined in 104.02.B , 104.02.C , 104.02.E , or 104.02.F .
2 .
Delays due to utility interference within the project site as defined in 105.07 .
3 .
Delays due to an Engineer-ordered suspension as defined in 104.02.D .
4 .
Delays due to the actions or neglect of the Department or its failure to act .
Pay will be determined for excusable , compensable delays as specified in 109.03.D .
E. Nonexcusable Delays .
Nonexcusable delays are non-compensable .
Time extensions will not be granted for nonexcusable delays .
F. Concurrent Delays .
When a nonexcusable delay is concurrent with an excusable ( compensable or noncompensable ) delay , the Contractor is not entitled to a time extension or additional pay for the period the nonexcusable delay is concurrent with the excusable delay .
When an excusable , noncompensable delay is concurrent with an excusable , compensable delay , the Contractor is entitled to a time extension but no additional pay for the period the noncompensable delay is concurrent with the compensable delay .
2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 89 of 571 108.08 Failure to Complete on Time .
If the contract time expires , liquidated damages will be assessed for each working day the work remains substantially incomplete after the contract time or its most recent extension has expired .
Liquidated damages are not a penalty .
The Engineer will determine working days for the assessment of liquidated damages as specified in 108.02.B .
For calendar day and completion date contracts , the Engineer will not exclude days during December , January , and February .
Liquidated damages will be deducted from monies due to the Contractor or will be billed to the Contractor .
Liquidated damages will not be assessed after substantial completion of the work as evidenced in writing , as long as the Contractor performs the remaining work .
Allowing the Contractor to continue and finish the work after the contract time expires in no way operates as a waiver on the part of the Department of its rights under the contract .
108.09 Default and Termination of Contract .
If the Contractor is responsible for any of the following , the Engineer may provide written notice to the Contractor and surety of the delay , neglect , or default : 1 .
Failing to begin the work by the date specified in the notification of award .

B .
Price Adjustment .
The Department will consider progress estimate adjustments to applicable contract item costs as a payment to the Contractor , or a credit to the Department , when the indexes change as defined for asphalt and fuel .
On the first Monday for each month , the Department will publish a current asphalt index ( CAI ) based on the previous 4-week average as reported by Poten & Partners , Inc. for the Boise area and a current fuel index ( CFI ) based on the price of ultra-low sulfur , clear , diesel # 2 fuel , as reported by Oil Price Information Services .
The contract base asphalt index ( BAI ) and base fuel index ( BFI ) will be the last posted index amount preceding the bid opening date .
A payment to the Contractor may be applied or a credit to the Department may be deducted from monies due the Contractor for each affected progress estimate .
Work performed at no expense to the Department will not be eligible for an adjustment .
1 .
Computing the Asphalt Price Adjustment .
A price adjustment will be made only when the CAI varies by more than 10 percent from the BAI and only for that portion of the variance in excess of 10 percent .
Credits and payments are computed as follows : a .
The tons of asphalt used during each progress estimate period will be computed for applicable contract items .
The plant mix asphalt quantity used , when the item includes asphalt and additives , will be calculated at the approved contractor job mix formula ( C-JMF ) percentage .
Asphalt binder contained in RAP is not eligible for an asphalt price adjustment ( APA ) .
Only virgin asphalt binder in the mix will be eligible for an APA .
The APA for emulsified asphalt products will be calculated based on the percentage of asphalt in the emulsion , which is estimated at 65 percent and 32.5 percent for diluted emulsion .
b .
The total asphalt tons used for each progress estimate period will be summed for the applicable contract items .
96 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction c. The APA credit or payment is computed from the following formula : Contractor payment if CAI is greater than 110 % of BAI : APA = ( CAI – 1.10 BAI ) * Q Department credit if CAI is less than 90 % of BAI : APA = ( CAI – 0.90 BAI ) * Q Where : APA = Asphalt price adjustment in dollars .
BAI = Base asphalt index .
CAI = Current asphalt index .
Q = Total asphalt tons used for the progress estimate .
If the CAI increases by 50 percent or more over the BAI , the Department will determine the feasibility of continuing project construction .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing if the contract will be terminated as specified in 108.10 .
This adjustment will be applied only for material that is accepted and allowed to be left in place .
2 .
Computing the Fuel Price Adjustment .
A price adjustment will be made only when the CFI varies by more than 20 percent from the BFI , and only for that portion of the variance in excess of 20 percent .
Credits and payments are computed as follows : a .
The Engineer will obtain the work quantity performed from the progress estimate for the applicable contract items based on the categories in Table 109.02-1. b. Compute the fuel usage for each applicable contract item by multiplying the fuel usage rate by the work quantity performed for each item .
c. Sum the total fuel usage in gallons ( Q ) for the applicable contract items .
d. Compute the fuel price adjustment ( FPA ) credit or payment using the following formulas : Contractor payment if CFI is greater than 120 % of BFI : FPA = ( CFI – 1.20 BFI ) * Q Department credit if CFI is less than 80 % of BFI : FPA = ( CFI – 0.80 BFI ) * Q Where : FPA = Fuel price adjustment in dollars .
BFI = Base fuel index .
CFI = Current fuel index .
Q = Total fuel gallons used for the progress estimate .
When the work under the contract is completed , the Engineer will determine the difference between estimated quantities and final quantities for each applicable work item .
Calculate an average CFI of the CFI ’ s from individual pay estimates to which a FPA was applied .
Calculate the FPA for the fuel usage obtained from the difference between the estimated and final applicable contract item quantities based on the average CFI .
The final FPA will be paid or deducted on the final estimate .

It is the Department ’ s policy to ensure DBEs , as defined in 49 CFR Part 26 , have an equal opportunity to receive and participate in the United States Department of Transportation ( USDOT ) -assisted contracts .
The Contractor will include these requirements in every subcontract and modify language as necessary to make the program binding on all subcontracts .
The Contractor agrees to ensure DBE firms have the opportunity to participate in the performance of the contract .
The Contractor or its subcontractor ( s ) will not discriminate based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability in the performance of the contract .
The Contractor will carry out applicable requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and administration of USDOT-assisted contracts .
Failure by the Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract , which may result in the termination of this contract or result in the implementation of other remedy , as the Department deems appropriate .
It is required that a Contractor verify a DBE firm ’ s certification with the Idaho Unified Certification Program ( UCP ) .
The UCP directory is located at : https : //itd.dbesystem.com .
The Contractor must use the ITD-2396 form , with all supporting documentation to the Department ’ s Office of Civil Rights within 3 calendar days of bid opening or the Contractor ’ s bid will be deemed irregular as specified in 102.10 .
The Consultants must use the ITD-2398 form for consultant agreements when making DBE goal commitments for contract goals .
If the Department declares a DBE firm ineligible to perform work after the execution of a signed contract , then the DBE firm may complete the work , the Department will count the DBE firm ’ s participation toward the contract goal , although the DBE participation will not count toward the overall annual Department DBE goal .
If a Federal agency and/or the Department decertify a DBE before the DBE firm signs a contract , then the Contractor must replace the ineligible DBE firm with another DBE firm or demonstrate that it made a GFE to do so .
2 .
The Department determines the level of DBE participation on a contract-by-contract basis determined by the Department ’ s contract goal methodology , the contract bid documentation will state the contract goal percentage .
The Department will credit dollar volumes of participation toward the contract goal .
The Department will base the goal attainment on actual expenditures made to DBE firms providing a commercially useful function ( CUF ) , as adjusted as specified in 110.03.B.3 .
This includes only work actually performed by and paid to the DBE firm and the cost of equipment , supplies , and materials , except when the DBE purchases or leases the equipment , supplies , and materials from the Contractor .
The bidder hereby certifies that it made GFEs to seek out and consider DBE firms for work on the contract .
3 .
The Department will credit fees and expenditures toward to DBE goal as follows : a .
100 percent of the dollar value equal to the clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that the DBE performs with its own forces in a joint venture between a DBE and a non-DBE firm .
b .
100 percent of expenditures to a DBE manufacturer , a DBE subcontractor , or DBE professional consultant .
c. 100 percent of expenditures to a trucking firm that uses trucks it owns , insures , and operates using drivers it employs or leases from another DBE firm including an owner/operator who is also certified as a DBE .
A DBE firm may lease trucks from a non-DBE firm , including an owner/operator .
As a result , the DBE will receive credit for the total value of the services provided by the non-DBE firm not to exceed the value of the services provided by the DBE-owned trucks .
Any additional participation by non-DBE firms will receive credit only for fees or commission received .
110 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Example : DBE Firm X uses 2 of its own trucks on a contract .
It leases 2 trucks from DBE Firm Y and 6 trucks from non-DBE Firm Z. DBE credit would be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by Firm X and Firm Y , and may be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by 4 of the 6 trucks provided by Firm Z .
In all , full credit would be allowed for the participation of 8 trucks .
In respect to the other 2 trucks provided by Firm Z , DBE credit could be awarded only for the fees or commissions pertaining to those trucks Firm X receives because of the lease with Firm Z .
A lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use and control over the leased truck .
This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease if the DBE consents , so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck .
A leased truck must conspicuously display the name and identification number of the DBE .
d. 100 percent of the fees for equipment leased from a DBE towards the contract goal when the Contractor leases the equipment from a DBE , provided the DBE owns or has the equipment registered in its name .
If the DBE obtains the equipment from other sources , the Engineer will only credit the net fee .
e. 60 percent of expenditures paid out to a DBE dealer for supplies provided and the DBE is not a manufacturer .

It is the Department ’ s policy to ensure DBEs , as defined in 49 CFR Part 26 , have an equal opportunity to receive and participate in the USDOT-assisted contracts .
The Contractor will include these requirements in every subcontract and modify language as necessary to make the program binding on all subcontracts .
The Contractor agrees to ensure DBE firms have the opportunity to participate in the performance of the contract .
The Contractor or its subcontractor ( s ) will not discriminate based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability in the performance of the contract .
The Contractor will carry out applicable 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 113 of 571 requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and administration of USDOT-assisted contracts .
Failure by the Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract , which may result in the termination of this contract or result in the implementation of other remedy , as the Department deems appropriate .
It is required that a Contractor verify a DBE firm ’ s certification with the Idaho UCP .
The UCP directory is located at : https : //itd.dbesystem.com .
The Contractor must use the ITD-2396 form , with all supporting documentation to the Department ’ s Office of Civil Rights within 3 calendar days of bid opening or the Contractor ’ s bid will be deemed irregular as specified in 102.10 .
The Consultants must use the ITD-2398 form for consultant agreements when making DBE goal commitments for contract goals .
If the Department declares a DBE firm ineligible to perform work after the execution of a signed contract , then the DBE firm may complete the work , the Department will count the DBE firm ’ s participation toward the contract goal , although the DBE participation will not count toward the overall annual Department DBE goal .
If a Federal agency and/or the Department decertify a DBE before the DBE firm signs a contract , then the Contractor must replace the ineligible DBE firm with another DBE firm or demonstrate that it made a GFE to do so .
2 .
The Department determines the level of DBE participation on a contract-by-contract basis determined by the Department ’ s contract goal methodology , the contract bid documentation will state the contract goal percentage .
The Department will credit dollar volumes of participation toward the contract goal .
The Department will base the goal attainment on actual expenditures made to DBE firms providing a CUF , as adjusted as specified in 110.03.B.3 .
This includes only work actually performed by and paid to the DBE firm and the cost of equipment , supplies , and materials , except when the DBE purchases or leases the equipment , supplies , and materials from the Contractor .
The bidder hereby certifies that it made GFEs to seek out and consider DBE firms for work on the contract .
3 .
The Department will credit fees and expenditures toward to DBE goal as follows : a .
100 percent of the dollar value equal to the clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that the DBE performs with its own forces in a joint venture between a DBE and a non-DBE firm .
b .
100 percent of expenditures to a DBE manufacturer , a DBE subcontractor , or DBE professional consultant .
c. 100 percent of expenditures to a trucking firm that uses trucks it owns , insures , and operates using drivers it employs or leases from another DBE firm including an owner/operator who is also certified as a DBE .
A DBE firm may lease trucks from a non-DBE firm , including an owner/operator .
As a result , the DBE will receive credit for the total value of the services provided by the non-DBE firm not to exceed the value of the services provided by the DBE-owned trucks .
Any additional participation by non-DBE firms will receive credit only for fees or commission received .
Example : DBE Firm X uses 2 of its own trucks on a contract .
It leases 2 trucks from DBE Firm Y and 6 trucks from non-DBE Firm Z. DBE credit would be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by Firm X and Firm Y , and may be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by 4 of the 6 trucks provided by Firm Z .
In all , full credit would be allowed for the participation of 8 trucks .
In respect to the other 2 trucks provided by Firm Z , DBE credit could be awarded only for the fees or commissions pertaining to those trucks Firm X receives because of the lease with Firm Z .
A lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use and control over the leased truck .
This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease if the DBE 114 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction consents , so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck .
A leased truck must conspicuously display the name and identification number of the DBE .
d. 100 percent of the fees for equipment leased from a DBE towards the contract goal when the Contractor leases the equipment from a DBE , provided the DBE owns or has the equipment registered in its name .
If the DBE obtains the equipment from other sources , the Engineer will only credit the net fee .
e. 60 percent of expenditures paid out to a DBE dealer for supplies provided and the DBE is not a manufacturer .
A regular dealer is a firm that owns , operates , or maintains a store , warehouse , or other facility that supplies materials , articles , or equipment for purchase or lease and regularly stocks , sells , and leases to the public during the usual course of business .
f. 100 percent of the net fee ( if deemed reasonable ) for DBE brokers , packagers , and manufacturers ' representatives .
4 .
The Department requires all bidders to furnish DBE commitments on the ITD-2396 form and all supporting documentation for a construction contract within 3 calendar days of bid opening .
Failure to comply will result in the Contractor ’ s bid being deemed irregular as specified in 102.10 and will not be considered further .
The forms must contain : a .
The identity of the DBE firm ( s ) the Contractor intends to use in the execution of the contract .
b .
Description of the work and associated dollar amounts each DBE firm offered to perform .
c. Statement ( s ) of confirmation form signed by the committed DBE ( s ) on the DBE ’ s company letterhead or on an email with a signature and contact information block , stating the DBE plans to participate in the contract as specified in the Contractor ’ s commitment .

e. The Contractor must use the above-mentioned forms , unless the committed DBE firm ( s ) is unable or unwilling to perform because of default , decertification , or other relevant factors .
5 .
The Department considers the Contractor ’ s commitment to meet the specified goal as clear ( prima facie ) evidence it made a GFE to obtain DBE participation on the contract .
6 .
If the DBE commitment is below the contract goal amount , the Department will condition the award of contract to a determination made by the Contractor ’ s DBE program coordinator on the GFEs made to attain DBE participation .
Following is a list of efforts the Department evaluates when determining the Contractor 's GFEs to obtain DBE participation .
In addition to GFEs , the Department will consider the timing and intensity of the undertaking .

The commitment requires the Contractor to make continuing efforts throughout the contract to ensure that DBE participation remains at a level satisfying the following requirements : a .
Continuing DBE participation equals or exceeds contract goals .
b .
Continuing DBE participation equals or exceeds the approved level that is less than the contract goal as allowed under 110.03.B.6 .
The Contractor can not terminate a DBE subcontractor for convenience without the Engineer ’ s written consent .
If situations or conditions arise preventing a DBE firm from completing the originally agreed upon work , the Contractor will take affirmative action steps to re-establish DBE participation at a level needed to meet the original contract goal or demonstrate a GFE demonstrating the Contractor afforded other DBEs the opportunity to assume the original work .
Afterward , the Contractor must revise the DBE participation percentages on the ITD-2396 DBE commitment form and the Engineer must approve the revised plan with concurrence from the Department ’ s Office of Civil Rights .
Failure of the Contractor to meet 110.03.B will be a violation of the contract .
The Engineer will count the value of work actually performed by and paid to the DBE firms toward the Contractor 's DBE goal once the Engineer verifies payment through the Contractor ’ s reporting of monthly payments to its subcontractors and suppliers using the Department ’ s online tracking system .
8 .
The DBE firm must perform a CUF on the contract in order for the Engineer to count expenditures toward the contract goal and annual goal .
The Department defines CUF by using general industry practices and the provisions of 49 CFR Part 26 .
A DBE performs a CUF when : a .
A DBE firm executes a distinct element of the work by actually performing , managing , and supervising the work involved in accordance with industry standard practices , except where such practices are not consistent with DBE regulations and requirements , and b .

While working on a USDOT federally funded contract , regardless of an existing collective bargaining agreement , the Contractor will follow US DOT regulations requiring the Contractor to pay the appropriate trainee wage rates ( 23 CFR 230 , Appendix B to Subpart A-Training Special Provisions ) as follows : “ Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate minimum journeyman 's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period , 75 percent for the third quarter of the training period , and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period , unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on this project .
In that case , the appropriate rates approved by the Departments of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification who are covered by this Training Special Provision. ” If a trainee enrolls in a USDOL training program , the proper approved rate ( s ) apply .
If a trainee ’ s wage exceeds the prevailing wage rate , then the training hours do not apply to the hours/units specified in the contract unless approved first by the engineer .
Trainee wages and apprenticeship ratios will be clearly notated by the Contractor in the certified payroll .

a .
All Blasting Operations .
( 1 ) General .
Follow the final blasting plan and supplementals .
Before each blast , properly dispose of explosive packing materials and remove them from the project site .
Drill production blastholes on the patterns shown in the final blasting plan and within 2 blasthole diameters of the marked hole location .
If more than 5 percent of the holes are drilled outside of this tolerance , except as approved , fill these holes with crushed stone or approved material and then re-drill them at the proper locations at no additional cost to the Department .
If the re-drilling is due to changes in geology , ground conditions , or other constraints not identified in the contract , these re-drilled holes will not be calculated in the 5 percent tolerance .
Check the blastholes before explosives are loaded .
If the blastholes are not drilled to the correct depth , are plugged , or are unable to be fully loaded , clean out or re-drill those holes .
If more than 5 percent of the blastholes are shallower than in the final blast plan , re-drill the shallow holes to the proper depth at no additional cost to the Department .
Prove the proposed stemming material performs as required by a test blast .
Fit blastholes with a temporary plug to keep overburden , drill cuttings , or other foreign material from falling into the holes after drilling .
Fill unused drill holes with crushed stone or approved materials .
Where controlled blasting is required to form the final backslope , drilling ahead is not allowed until the test section results have been completely evaluated and , if necessary , the Contractor has made revisions to achieve the required results .
Unsatisfactory test blast results include unstable slopes , fragmentation beyond the indicated lines and grade , flyrock , excessive ground vibration , air overpressure , or violation of other requirements .
The Department will not pay for revised blasting methods adopted to produce an acceptable test blast .
Other requirements for controlled and production blasting operations specified elsewhere in 205 also apply to the blasting carried out in conjunction with the test blast .
2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 135 of 571 ( 2 ) Flyrock .

( 5 ) Daily Explosive Material Consumption and Report of Loss Report ( e.g. , BATF Daily Summary of Magazine Transactions ) .
Include the blaster-in-charge signature on all reports .
( 6 ) Pre-Blast Survey .
Before blasting , the Contractor will provide a third-party , pre-blast survey of the interior and exterior of nearby buildings , utilities , and other structures that may be subject to damage from blast-induced ground vibration or air overpressure effects .
Contact the property owner or resident to setup a pre-blast survey inspection appointment .
Document the pre-blast survey , in sufficient detail , to allow the Engineer to determine if the Contractor 's blasting operation has caused damage .
Submit a survey copy to the Engineer and to the structure ’ s owner no less than 7 calendar days before blasting begins .
If the property owner or resident does not respond after 3 documented attempts by at least 2 different contact methods ( e.g. , certified mail , knock on the door ) within 14 calendar days of the last attempt , the Contractor will notify the Engineer .
The Engineer will determine how to proceed .
136 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction ( 7 ) Post-Blast Survey .
Within 2 weeks after blasting operations have concluded or as directed , re-examine the items inspected during the pre-blast survey .

b .
Production Blasting .
Production blasting is rock fragmentation blasts resulting from more widely spaced production holes drilled throughout the main excavation area adjacent to the controlled blast line or from the production holes in a rock quarry .
Take necessary precautions in the production blasting to minimize blast damage to the final cut slope .
c. Controlled Blasting .
Controlled blasting refers to the controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories in carefully spaced and aligned drill holes to produce a smooth surface or shear plane in the rock along the specified final excavation backslope .
Controlled blasting techniques allowed are presplitting and cushion blasting .
Other controlled blasting techniques may be used , if approved .
Use controlled blasting in the excavation of rock or hard cemented materials where cut slopes are equal to or steeper than ¾H:1V even if the rock or hard materials can be ripped , except at the Engineer ’ s discretion based on the Contractor ’ s demonstration the finished slope meets the slope design .
Controlled blasting is typically not required for rock quarry operations .
Remove potentially dangerous boulders or other material located beyond the excavation limits before drilling controlled blastholes .
Removal of material located beyond the excavation limits is extra work .
( 1 ) Presplitting .
Presplitting is the detonation of a single line of lightly-loaded , closely-spaced drill holes before the detonation of adjacent production holes .
Perform presplitting in accordance with the following requirements : ( a ) Control drilling operations by using proper equipment and techniques to ensure that no hole deviates from the plane of the planned slope by more than 9 inches in 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 137 of 571 either parallel to or normal direction to the final excavation slope .
The Engineer will allow offset benches , up to 2 feet wide , for multi-lift blasts .
If shown on the plans , specified , or directed , the offset benches will be removed during excavation of the next lift to a slope of at least 45° below horizontal .
The Department will not pay for presplit holes exceeding these tolerances .
( b ) Extend presplit holes at least 30 feet beyond the production hole limits or to the end of the cut as applicable .
( c ) Limit presplit blastholes to 30 feet in length for each lift of blasting .
Do not exceed the specified lift height after a test blast is performed .
( d ) Begin the controlled blasthole drilling at a point that will allow for necessary offsets and adjust , at the start of lower lifts , to account for drift that may have occurred in the upper lifts .
The Department will ensure the offsets are within the project site .
( e ) Determine if the hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth before placing charges .
If drill-hole conditions vary from dry to wet , use appropriate explosives type ( s ) and/or blasting accessories to accomplish the specified results .
( f ) Do not use bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil ( ANFO ) as explosive for controlled blasting .
( g ) Use only standard explosives specifically manufactured for presplitting in presplit holes .
( h ) As long as satisfactory presplit slopes are obtained , the Contractor may either detonate the presplit blasting holes forming the slope face before drilling for production blasting or detonate the presplit blasting holes forming the slope face and the production blastholes within the same blast event , provided the presplitting drill holes are detonated at least 25 milliseconds ahead of the adjacent production blastholes .
( 2 ) Cushion Blasting .
Cushion or trim blasting is similar to presplitting except the detonation along the cut face is performed after the detonation of the production holes .
Where the horizontal distance from the cut face to the existing rock face is less than 15 feet , the Contractor may cushion blast instead of presplitting .
With the exception of these criteria , the requirements specified for presplitting also apply to cushion blasting .
205.04 Method of Measurement .

3 .
CRABS Process .
a. Proportioning .
Furnish portland cement in bulk .
Add the cement to the pulverized material using a mechanical spreader at the specified rate within 5 percent for the full width of the typical section .
Synchronize the application rate with the machine speed to provide uniform application .
Spread the cement in a dry state and do not allow blowing of the cement .
After spreading the portland cement , mix the cement with the pulverized material to obtain the required depth and width .
Distribute only as much portland cement as can be mixed and compacted within the same working day .
b. Mixing .
Use a road mixing machine ( pugmill , auger , or cross-shaft mixer ) capable of providing a uniform homogeneous mixture .
Introduce the water through the mixing machine using a metering device .
Add the correct quantity of water to produce a mixture between 4 and 7 percent by weight of mixed and compacted material .
Do not allow water leakage from equipment .
Do not add excessive water .
Mix the existing pulverized pavement , base , and cement to the full depth as specified .
Shape and roll where necessary to allow the roadway to be open to traffic ( i.e. , approaches to businesses and residencies ) .
More than 1 pass of the mixer may be required .
Introduce water with the final mixing pass .
Ensure and document the mixing thickness every 0.3 mile in each lane .
In superelevated curve sections , shape the material before the application of portland cement .
4 .
Shaping and Grade Control .
Provide continuous grade and cross-slope control including surveying ( blue topping or wire line control ) depending on CRABS Class .
It is expected that the pulverized material will swell 15 to 30 percent before compaction .
Use the centerline of the existing roadway as the typical section control line .
Construct the cross slope as shown .
Adjustments may be required to the existing roadway profile to provide a consistent grade and to avoid adding new material or wasting existing material .
If necessary , reestablish the roadway profile and cross slopes to provide a roadway section which is consistent with the typical section .
Obtain approval for transverse grades .
For CRABS Class II work , the grades in the Department-provided gradebook may be adjusted to avoid adding new material or wasting existing material upon approval .
Use equipment for shaping and setting grade capable of automated ( mechanical or electronic ) setting of grade and cross slope angle .
Account for swell in the grading operation which may leave the processed surface above the adjacent surface .
Incorporate all pulverized material into the CRABS layer .
Shape and finish the CRABS surface without adding new material or wasting existing material .
Do not waste or use pulverized material as shoulder material .
2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction 167 of 571 Grade designated shoulder material to a location and elevation on the shoulder that is below the top of the CRABS layer .
Do not use cement-treated material for shoulder material .
Place windrow material designated for removal adjacent to , but outside the limits of pulverization .

For the compaction train , include at least 1 rubber-tired roller , 1 vibratory roller , and 1 vibratory pad-foot soil compactor .
Use compaction equipment and/or rolling methods to produce the required compaction without damaging the work ..
The vibratory soil compactor will have a minimum centrifugal force of 15 tons , minimum drum width of 60 inches , and minimum pad height of 3½ inches .
Use the vibratory pad-foot soil compactor after the cement has been mixed .
Cover the material with a minimum of 3 complete passes .
Additional passes may be required to achieve compaction .
Perform all other final process rolling and blading after completion of the vibratory pad foot operation .
Establish a roller pattern using in-place density from an uncorrected nuclear gauge .
Use the roller pattern as a standard from which to measure compaction .
Compaction is achieved when additional roller passes add no more than 0.5 pound per cubic feet to the previous in-place density .
Ensure a “ false break ” or leveling-off point is not used for compaction density .
Reestablish a new roller pattern when mixture properties change and at a minimum of every 7,200 square yards of finished surface .
Perform grading and rolling without wasting material .
Accomplish all shaping , final process rolling and associated blading within 1½ hours of the initial blending of the cement and water .
Do not use vibratory rollers on the CRABS surface beyond the 1½ hours after the addition of water and cement .
6 .
Protection .
Keep the processed and compacted material visibly moist at all times until the initial lift of plant mix is applied .
Use equipment that will apply the water in a fog or mist type application free of pressure on the surface being treated .
7 .
Paving .
Pave over the CRABS as soon as possible following compaction and within 48 hours after the introduction of cement and water to the CRABS .
When the approved traffic control plan requires traffic to be detoured to an alternate roadway , the 48- hour paving requirement may be waived provided the CRABS surface is kept sufficiently moist .
Tight-blading and static rolling may be required before applying the initial lift of plant mix due to surface deformation , raveling , or other irregularities created by traffic .
Ensure there is no loose material on the CRABS surface at the time of plant mix paving .
After paving , dress the roadway shoulders to provide a uniform appearance .
8 .
Prime Coat .
Immediately before placement of the initial lift of plant mix pavement , apply a prime coat full width at the rate specified or as directed .

When placing operations involve dropping the concrete more than 5 feet , deposit concrete through sheet metal or other approved tubes .
Keep tubes full of concrete during placing and their lower ends buried in the newly placed concrete , as much as practical .
Control the rate of depositing concrete in forms to prevent deflections of the forms or form panels in excess of the deflections specified .
Place concrete in the forms as soon as possible after mixing .
Keep the concrete plastic and workable .
The concrete placement is to be continuous , with no interruption longer than 30 minutes between adjoining layers .
Fill each part of the form carefully by depositing the concrete as near the final position as possible .
Place and consolidate each layer before the preceding layer takes initial set .
Do not jar the forms or allow strain to be placed on the ends of projecting reinforcement after initial set of the concrete .
Do not place bridge decks and other concrete flatwork when the evaporation rate is greater than 0.15 pounds per square foot per hour when tested in accordance with Idaho IT 133 .
Flatwork is a surface not cured in contact with a form and that is not part of a construction joint .
Surfaces essentially vertical are excluded from the definition .
Use the proper mix design and combination of low shrink materials , low temperature concrete , proper curing techniques , or other procedures necessary to eliminate or minimize the development of cracks .
The Engineer will determine surface crack intensity after completion of concrete cure and before prestressing or releasing of forms or falsework .
The surface crack intensity of concrete bridge decks is determined by the number and size of cracks in the top surface of the concrete .
Remove equipment and material from the deck and clean the surface as necessary for the Engineer to measure the crack intensity .
Fill cracks in any 60 square yard portion of deck when there are more than 50 feet of cracks whose width exceeds 0.02 inch with a 2 component modified methacrylate penetrating sealer or equal , as approved .
Fill the cracks in accordance with the penetrating sealer manufacturer ’ s written instructions at no additional cost to the Department .
Decks that have excessive cracking or cracking that jeopardizes the structural integrity of the deck may be determined unacceptable by the Engineer and require removal .
Work after the placement is incidental and the cost included in the contract unit price for concrete .
2 .

( b ) Ensure the measured gap for DTIs is at 0.005 inch or less .
Refusal of the feeler gauge in slots is defined as a nil gap and may be cause for rejection by the Engineer .
The Engineer may require bolts with nil gap to be removed from the work and the bolt thread examined at no additional cost to the Department .
If no necking of the bolt thread is observed and the nut can run down the full length of the thread , then the bolt may be reinstalled with new DTIs .
b. Turn-of-Nut Method .
After bolts in the joint have been brought to snug-tightness , further tighten the nuts by the amount of rotation in Table 504.03-3 .
Before final tightening and after snug-tightening , match-mark with crayon or paint the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt .
To ensure this tightening method is followed , the Engineer will : ( 1 ) Observe as the Contractor installs and tightens bolts .
( 2 ) Inspect each match-mark .
Place 3 bolts of the same grade , size , and condition as those under inspections individually in a device calibrated to measure bolt tension .
Perform this calibration at least once each inspection day .
Provide a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt if washers are used on the structure .
If washers are not used on the structure , provide material abutting for the part turned that is the same as specified for use on the structure .
In the calibrated device , tighten each bolt to the specified tension .
Apply the inspecting wrench to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head 5 degrees or approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius in the tightening direction .
Take the average of the torque for the 3 bolts as the job-inspection torque .
In the Engineer ’ s presence , inspect the tightened bolt using an inspection torque wrench .
Select 10 percent or at least 2 of the tightened bolts on the structure represented by the test bolts at random in each connection .
Apply the job-inspection torque to each with the inspecting wrench turned in the tightening direction .
If this torque turns no bolt head or nut , the Engineer will accept the connection as being properly tightened , but if the torque turns 1 or more bolt heads or nuts , apply the job inspection torque to bolts in the connection .
Tighten and re-inspect bolts whose head or nut turns at this stage .
The Contractor may retighten the bolts in the connection and resubmit for inspection .

The working force and working stress are defined as the force and stress remaining in the prestressing steel after all losses have taken place , including creep and shrinkage of concrete , elastic compression of concrete , creep of steel , losses in post-tensioned prestressing steel due to sequence of stressing , friction and take-up of anchorage , and other losses peculiar to the method or system of prestressing have been provided for or have taken place .
Ensure the stress loss in post-tensioned prestressing steel due to elastic shortening , shrinkage and creep of concrete , and relaxation of prestressing steel matches the plan details .
Use the following formula and friction coefficients to calculate friction losses in tendons : T0 = Tx * e ( Ua + Kl ) Where : T0 = steel stress at jacking end Tx = steel stress at point x e = 2.7183 ( base of Naperian logarithms ) U = friction curvature coefficient ( see Table 506.03-1 ) a = total angular change of prestressing steel profile in radians from jacking end to point x K = friction wobble coefficient ( see Table 506.03-1 ) l = length of prestressing steel from jacking end to point x 310 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Table 506.03-1 – Steel Coefficient Type of Steel Type of Duct K U Wire or strand Galvanized-rigid 0.0002 0.25 Plain bars Galvanized 0.0002 0.15 Deformed bars Galvanized 0.0003 0.30 E.

F. Preparation and Stressing .
For pre-tensioning , accurately hold in position the prestressing elements during stressing .
The Contractor may cast in 1 continuous line several units and stress at 1 time .
Do not transfer bond stress to the concrete until the concrete has attained the compressive strength specified .
Cut and release the elements in an order that minimizes lateral eccentricity of stress .
Before placing forms for closing slabs of box girder cells , the Engineer must verify that ducts are unobstructed .
For post-tensioning , install the prestressing steel after the concrete has been placed .
The Engineer must verify the ducts are without water and debris immediately before installation of the prestressing steel .
During installation , ensure the prestressing steel is laid out in an orderly manner corresponding with its final positioning in the ducts , without overlaps and kinks .
After installation and before post-tensioning a member , the Engineer must verify the prestressing steel is free and un-bonded in the duct .
Do not prestress cast-in-place concrete until at least 10 calendar days after the last concrete has been placed in the member to be prestressed .
Additionally , ensure the compressive strength of the last placed concrete has reached the strength specified for the concrete at the time of stressing .
Conduct the tensioning process so tension being applied and the elongation of the prestressing steel may be measured .
Keep a record of gauge pressure and elongations and submit for approval .
For prestressing tendons in continuous post-tensioned members , tension by jacking at each end of the tendon .
The Contractor does not need to jack both ends simultaneously .
Re-tension the unit before grout is placed if slippage of prestressing steel after tensioning is greater than 1/8 inch of the amount assumed in elongation calculations in a unit .
For post-tensioning , do not stress more than ½ of the prestressing force in a girder before an equal force is stressed in the adjacent girders .
During the stressing operations , do not apply more than 1/6 of the total prestressing force eccentrically about the centerline of the structure .
Distribute the prestressing force with an approximately equal value in each girder and place symmetrically about the centerline of the structure .
In slabs , uniformly distribute the prestressing force across the slab .

On vertical surfaces , brush the final strokes vertically .
3 .
Roller Application .
Select a nap size and roller quality that will properly wet the substrate and produce a smooth , uniform film and finish .
Apply the coating in such a manner as to achieve complete and thorough coverage of the surface .
4 .
Daubers .
On surfaces that are inaccessible for paintbrushes , use sheepskins or daubers especially constructed for the purpose .
Apply each coat only after the previous coat has been allowed to dry as required by the manufacturer 's written instructions , but as soon as possible , to minimize the length of time that the coating is exposed to dust and con- tamination .
Do not allow any coat to remain exposed for longer than the manufacturer ’ s written instructions for maximum recoat time before recoating .
If a coat exceeds the manufacturer ’ s maximum recoat times for any reason , remove and replace the coating .
As an alternative to removing and replacing the coating , the Contractor may use a specialized surface preparation method .
If so , the Contractor must provide written instructions from the coating manufacturer ( e.g. , scarifying the surface ) to properly prepare the surface to receive the next coat .
The specialized steps must be approved by the Engineer in writing .
The Contractor will perform the specialized cleaning or removal and replacement of the coatings at no additional cost to the Department .

Paint film thickness measurements must be made and documented after each application .
Where thickness measurements fall below the specified minimum , additional applications of paint must be made to meet the thickness required .
All coatings must be inspected and approved by the Engineer before the next coating is applied .
Apply all coats in such a manner to ensure that they are well adhered to each other and to the substrate .
If the application of any coat causes lifting of an underlying coat or there is poor adhesion between coats or to the substrate , remove the coating in the affected area to adjacent sound , adherent coating , and reapply the material .
If adhesion is questionable , conduct adhesion tests in accordance with ASTM D3359 or ASTM D4541 as directed and repair all test areas .
The Engineer will establish the acceptance criteria for the testing .

Provide processed RAP with 100 percent passing the ⅝ inch sieve on entry into the mixing plant .
The Contractor may recycle processed RAP in Superpave HMA at the percentages shown below : ( 1 ) Category 1 RAP is limited to 30 percent .
( 2 ) Category 2 RAP is allowed up to 10 percent when used in the top lift and is limited to 30 percent maximum when used in a lower lift .
Processed RAP stockpiles may contain RAP from sources as indicated by the category and may be replenished with RAP from sources of that same category .
3 .
RAP Testing and Test Frequency .
Perform the following tests at the specified testing frequencies for each category and provide the data to the Department as soon as test results are available : a .
Category 1 .
Establish an extraction correlation .
Determine the asphalt binder content and aggregate gradation in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T 308 and AASHTO T 30 at the 570 of 571 2018 ITD Standard Specifications for Highway Construction minimum frequency of 1 test per 500 tons for the first 2,000 tons and 1 test per 1,000 tons thereafter .
Then perform at least 6 tests for stockpiles less than 4,000 tons .
Perform chemical binder extractions in accordance with AASHTO T 319 to reclaim the binder from the RAP when blending charts are used .

Perform a minimum of 10 tests per stockpile .
Provide the test results on a spreadsheet with the mix design submittal and update the spreadsheet , if additional RAP is produced before producing HMA .
For testing after stockpiling , submit a sample plan and test the RAP pile , either in-situ or by re-stockpiling , for approval .
Meet the minimum frequency required and detail the procedure used to obtain representative samples throughout the stockpile for testing .
4 .
RAP Stockpiles and Record Keeping .
Place RAP stockpiles on a base with adequate drainage and construct in layers to minimize RAP segregation and ensure a workable face .
Construct separate stockpiles for each source of RAP based on the category of RAP , the quality of aggregate , type and quantity of asphalt binder , and size of processed material .
Identify RAP stockpiles on a map of the stockpile areas and place signs in or near each stockpile .
Maintain a record system at the plant site for RAP stockpiles that includes , at a minimum , the following : a .
Stockpile identification and a sketch of stockpile areas at the plant site .
b. RAP category ( project , state route , plant waste , rejected loads ) .
c. Origin or dates milled and approximate number of tons in the stockpile .
d. Chemical extraction and AASHTO T 308 burn test results .
