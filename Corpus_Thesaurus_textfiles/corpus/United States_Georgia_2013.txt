Standard Specifications Construction of Transportation Systems Approved by The State Transportation Board April 18 , 2013 Johnny Floyd Chairman Keith Golden , P.E .
Commissioner Russell McMurry , P.E .
Chief Engineer 2013 Edition iii Preface The text included in Specification Sections 148 , 149 , and 151 through 941 is written in the imperative mood ( sentences often begin with commands ) .
All commands and references in , or in connection with , these Specifications ( including all text , related documents , electronic media , graphics , or photographs ) are written to imply Contractor responsibility for action—unless otherwise specified .
Text placed in text boxes within a Specification does not imply any greater significance than any other text in the Specification .
The Specifications contain dual units of measurement—The United States Standard Measure ( English units ) and the International System of Units ( SI or “ metric ” units ) .
The English units are expressed first with the SI ( metric ) units following in parentheses .
The measurements expressed in the two systems of units are not necessarily equal .
In most cases the measurement in SI units is a “ hard ” conversion of the English measurement .
That is , the SI ( metric ) unit is a rounded , rationalized SI measurement that is easy to work with and remember .
The Proposal will designate whether the Project was designed and is to be constructed in either English units ( English project ) or SI units ( metric project ) .
The dimensions , measurements , and requirements stated in the system of units designated in the Proposal are the applicable Specification requirements for the Contract .
All Contractor submittals shall be prepared in the designated system of units .
Pay Item quantities will be measured in the designated system of units .

The Contractor ’ s plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time .
If the Engineer finds that The Work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor , he may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify .
Any authorized extension of the Contract Time will be in full force and effect the same as though it was the original Contract Time .
F. Suspension of Time Charges If the Engineer suspends The Work by reason of failure of the Contractor to carry out written orders given , or to comply with any provision of the Contract , Time Charges will continue through the period of such suspension .
If the Contractor is declared in default , Time Charges will continue .
Except on Completion Date Contracts , Time Charges will not be made against the Contract when the only remaining controlling items of work are shut down by the Engineer because of seasonal limitations or temperature controls .
G. When Time Charges Cease Time charges will cease when all work on Contract Items have been completed to the satisfaction of the Engineer .
The only exception to this requirement is that a satisfactory growth of vegetative cover and application ( s ) of nitrogen will not be required when Time Charges are stopped , provided all filling of washes and repairs to planted areas have been accomplished .
Maintenance of planted areas in order to produce a satisfactory growth after Time Charges have stopped will be performed without assessment of liquidated damages provided this work is diligently prosecuted .

When the Contract Time is based on an available day basis , the schedule for available days shall be used .
For each Calendar Day or Available Day , as specified , that any work shall remain uncompleted after the contract time specified for the completion of The Work required by the Contract , the sum specified in the Contract will be deducted from any money due the Contractor , not as a penalty , but as liquidated damages ; provided however , that due account shall be taken of any adjustment of the contract time for completion of the work granted under the provisions of Subsection 108.07.E .
The Department may waive such portions of the liquidated damages as may accrue after the work is in condition for safe and convenient use by the traveling public .
A .
Liquidated Damages The amount of such charges is hereby agreed upon as fixed liquidated damages due the Department after the expiration of the time for completion specified in the Contract .
The Contractor and his Surety shall be liable for liquidated damages in excess of the amount due the Contractor on the final payment .
These fixed liquidated damages are not established as a penalty but are calculated and agreed upon in advance by the Department and the Contractor due the uncertainty and impossibility of making a determination as to the actual and consequential damages which are incurred by the Department , the State , and the general public as a result of the failure on the part of the Contractor to complete The Work on time .

3 .
Metering : The volume may be determined by metering , in which case the metering device used and the method of using it shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer .
4 .
Time of Deliveries : The arrival and departure of vehicles delivering bituminous materials to the Project site shall be so scheduled that the Engineer is afforded proper time for the measurements of delivered volume and final outage .
The Engineer will make the necessary measurements only during the Contractor ’ s normal daily working hours .
C. Production for Multiple Projects When a Contractor is producing Asphaltic Concrete from one plant , which is being placed on two or more jobs , public or private , the amount of bituminous material used may be determined by extraction tests in accordance with Subsection 109.02.A.3 or digital recording device in accordance with Subsection 109.02.A.4 .
D. Tack Coat When the same storage facility is utilized for Bituminous Materials to be used in Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete , Bituminous Tack Coat , and/or Surface Treatment , the quantity used for Tack Coat shall be converted to tons ( megagrams ) and deducted from the quantities for the Bituminous Material used in the Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete and Surface Treatment .
E. Corrections When the volume and temperature have been determined as defined above , the volume will be corrected by the use of the following formula : VEnglish = V1 Vmetric = V1 K ( t-60 ) + 1 K ( t-15 ) + 1 Where : V = Volume of bituminous material at 60 °F ( 15 °C ) V1= Volume of hot bituminous material t = Temperature of hot bituminous material in degrees Fahrenheit ( Celsius ) K= Coefficient of Expansion of bituminous material ( correction factor ) The correction factors K for various materials are given below : Section 109-Measurement and Payment 60 0.00035 ( 0.00063 ) per °F ( °C ) for petroleum oils having a specific gravity of 60 °F/60 °F ( 15 °C/15 °C ) above 0.966 0.00040 ( 0.00072 ) per °F ( °C ) for petroleum oils having a specific gravity of 60 °F/60 °F ( 15 °C/15 °C ) between 0.850-0.966 0.00030 ( 0.00054 ) per °F ( °C ) for Tar 0.00025 ( 0.00045 ) per °F ( °C ) for Emulsified Asphalt 0.00040 ( 0.00072 ) per °F ( °C ) for Creosote Oil 109.03 Scope of Payment The Contractor shall receive and accept the compensation provided for in the Contract as full payment for furnishing all materials , labor , tools , equipment , superintendence and incidentals , and for performing all work contemplated and embraced under the Contract in a complete and acceptable manner , for any infringement of patent , trademark or copyright , for all loss or damage arising from the nature of The Work , or from the action of the elements , for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of the suspension or discontinuance of The Work , or from any unforeseen difficulties which may be encountered during the prosecution of The Work and for all risks of every description connected with the prosecution of The Work until its Final Acceptance by the Engineer , except as provided in Subsection 107.16 .

Segregated Mixture Prevent mixture placement yielding a segregated mat by following production , storage , loading , placing , and handling procedures .
Ensure needed plant modifications and provide necessary auxiliary equipment .
( See Subsection 400.1.01 , “ Definitions. ” ) If the mixture is segregated in the finished mat , the Department will take actions based on the degree of segregation .
The actions are described below .
1 .
Unquestionably Unacceptable Segregation When the Engineer determines the segregation in the finished mat is unquestionably unacceptable , follow these measures : a .
Suspend Work and require the Contractor to take positive corrective action .
The Department will evaluate the segregated areas to determine the extent of the corrective work to the in-place mat as follows : Perform extraction and gradation analysis by taking 6 in ( 150 mm ) cores from typical , visually unacceptable segregated areas .
Determine the corrective work according to Subsection 400.3.06.E.3 .
b .
Require the Contractor to submit a written plan of measures and actions to prevent further segregation .
Work will not continue until the plan is submitted to and approved by the Department .
c. When work resumes , place a test section not to exceed 500 tons ( 500 Mg ) of the affected mixture for the Department to evaluate .
If a few loads show that corrective actions were not adequate , follow the measures above beginning with step 1.a .
above .
If the problem is solved , Work may continue .
2 .
Unacceptable Segregation Suspected When the Engineer observes segregation in the finished mat and the work may be unacceptable , follow these measures : a .
Allow work to continue at Contractor ’ s risk .
b .
Require Contractor to immediately and continually adjust operation until the visually apparent segregated areas are eliminated from the finished mat .
The Department will immediately investigate to determine the severity of the apparent segregation as follows : Take 6 in ( 150 mm ) cores from typical areas of suspect segregation .
Test the cores for compliance with the mixture control tolerances in Section 828 .
When these tolerances are exceeded , suspend work for corrective action as outlined in Subsection 400.3.06.E.3 .
3 .
Corrective Work a .
Remove and replace ( at the Contractor ’ s expense ) any segregated area where the gradation on the control sieves is found to vary 10 percent or more from the approved job mix formula , the asphalt cement varies 1.0 % or more from the approved job mix formula , or if in-place air voids exceed 13.5 % based on GDT 39 .

402.2 Materials A. RAP Material Composition Use RAP materials from any of the following : Existing roadway Contractor ’ s RAP stockpile that has been approved by the Department Department stockpile NOTE : The location of Department RAP material stockpiles will be given on the Plans .
Do not use RAP materials that contain alluvial gravel or local sand in any mixture placed on interstate projects except for mixtures used in shoulder construction .
When used in shoulder construction , limit RAP containing local sand or alluvial gravel so that the sand or gravel contributes no more than 20 % of the total aggregate portion of the mix .
1 .
RAP Percentage For non-interstate projects , limit the percentage of RAP allowed in recycled mixes so that the overall amount of alluvial gravel does not exceed 5 percent of the total mix .
The percentage of alluvial gravel , local sand , and Group I material in the RAP will be determined through petrographic analysis or available records .
2 .
RAP furnished to the Contractor but not used in the work remains the Contractor ’ s property .
RAP used in the recycled mixtures for mainline or ramps ( if applicable ) may make up from 0 to 40 percent of the mixture depending on the amount of RAP available , the production facilities , and whether the mixture meets the requirements in Section 828 .
The maximum ratio of RAP material to the recycled mixtures other than SMA is 40 percent for continuous mix type plants and 25 percent for batch type plants .
The maximum ratio of RAP material to the recycled mixture is 15 percent for Stone Matrix Asphalt ( SMA ) mixes .
3 .
Process RAP Material Section 402-Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete 306 Process RAP material to be used in the recycled mixture so that 100 percent will pass the 2 in ( 50 mm ) sieve .

450.3.05 Construction A .
Observing Weather Limitations Begin pressure grouting operations when the air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is at least 35 ºF ( 2 ºC ) and rising .
Stop pressure grouting if the temperature is 40 ºF ( 4 ºC ) and falling or when the subgrade contains an abnormal amount of moisture .
B .
Testing Slab testing is performed to detect all slabs having a deflection greater than 0.030 in ( 0.76 mm ) .
Perform testing between 3:00 AM and 9:00 AM , unless otherwise directed by the Engineer .
In hot weather , test between 3:00 AM and 7:00 AM if directed by the Engineer .
Stop testing if slabs are beginning to “ lock-up. ” 1 .
Preliminary Testing by the Department Preliminary testing is not required on slabs that require grouting but have been previously tested and marked by the Department .
2 .
Preliminary Testing by the Contractor If the Department has not performed preliminary testing , use static methods to test each transverse joint and crack on the Project or within designated Project areas .
Do not test , however , transverse cracks in slabs that are to be replaced entirely .
Test the joints and cracks as follows : a. Furnish four gauges on two gauge mounts ( two gauges per mount ) that can detect slab movement under the load to the nearest 0.001 in ( 0.025 mm ) .
b .
Maintain the gauges and mounts in operating order .
Furnish the loaded truck , truck operator , and personnel to place and assist in operating the gauges .
c. Position one set of gauges with one gauge referenced to the corner of each slab on both sides of the joint near the pavement edge .
Zero in the gauges with no load on the slab on either side of the joint .
d. Move the test truck into position and stop it with the center of the test axle about 1 ft ( 300 mm ) behind the joint and the outside test wheel approximately 1 ft ( 300 mm ) from the pavement edge .
e. Read the back gauge and move the test truck across the joint to about 1 ft ( 300 mm ) forward of the joint .
Read the forward gauge .
f. Repeat this operation for each joint to be tested .
The Inspector will read and record the gauges .
g. When required , perform additional tests on slabs that move more than 0.030 in ( 0.76 mm ) or as shown on the Plans .
Perform additional tests as follows : 1 ) Drill one hole in the corner of the slab where the movement was measured .
2 ) Drill the holes the same diameter as the undersealing holes and place the holes 18 in ( 450 mm ) from the transverse and shoulder joint .
3 ) Fill the test holes with water and observe .
4 ) If the Engineer believes the pavement system readily drains the water poured into the test hole , pressure grout the slab .
Based on the results of testing , deflection measurements , and water drainage observations , the Engineer will determine which slabs require undersealing .
h. After the designated slabs have been pressure grouted according to these Specifications , retest them according to Subsection 450.3.05.B.2 , “ Testing. ” i. Regrout and retest slabs that deflect more than 0.030 in ( 0.76 mm ) or deflect the amount shown on the Plans , as directed .
Section 450-Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Conrete Pavement 449 Slabs will be accepted that continue to show movement greater than specified after two properly performed groutings .
C. Drilling Holes The Plans show the location of holes to be drilled in each type of slab for undersealing .
However , whenever possible , use the holes from previous undersealing work by redrilling .
To begin drilling : 1 .
Use the hole pattern and pumping sequence shown on the Plans with modifications to use as many holes from previous undersealing work as possible .
The Engineer may alter the hole pattern .
Only the actual number of holes drilled will be considered for payment for the initial undersealing .
2 .
Drill the holes 1.5 in ( 38 mm ) diameter or another size if approved by the Engineer .
Ensure that the holes provide positive seal for the pumping nozzle .
3 .
For the first undersealing , drill the holes to approximately 8 in ( 200 mm ) deep beneath the bottom of the concrete unless the Engineer approves an alternate depth .
The Engineer shall designate the number , depth , and location of holes for undersealing attempts after the initial attempt .
4 .
Be careful during operations to not break or crack the slabs .
5 .
Repair slabs that have cracks that extend through the drill hole at the Contractor ’ s expense .
Make repairs according to Section 609 and Section 452 .
D. Cleaning Holes After drilling the holes , and immediately before pumping the underseal grout , insert a pipe with enough air pressure in each hole to remove debris and to provide a passage for the grout , if necessary .
E. Pumping Underseal Grout Properly position the lift measuring device before pumping grout under a slab .
Fill the voids under a slab as follows : 1 .
Pump grout in holes designated by the Engineer .
2 .
Have the Engineer determine the time of day to perform pressure grouting .
The Engineer may require pressure grouting during late night and early morning hours if the slabs can not be stabilized with daytime grouting .
3 .
During pumping , watch the lift measuring device to prevent excessive pumping pressures , rapid lifting of slabs , or substantial rising of the adjacent shoulders .
4 .
Stop pumping in the hole when the cavities or voids are filled within the range of the hole being grouted .
Grout flowing out of an adjacent hole or joint or the edge of the slab is sufficient evidence that the voids and cavities are filled and pumping should cease .
Additional evidence is that the slab rises rapidly or the adjacent shoulder begins to rise .
a .
Lift the slab slightly to move grout into the existing cavities and voids .
b .
Do not lift more than 0.050 in ( 1.3 mm ) for a slab measured at the outside joint corner unless approved by the Engineer .
NOTE : Do not crack the slabs by differential lifting .
5 .
Secure the discharge hose nozzle in the hole to provide a seal that will maintain the grout pressure underneath the slab .
Ensure that the nozzle end does not extend below the bottom of the concrete .
6 .
Continue pumping in a hole until a clear flow of grout comes out other holes , joints , or cracks , or until the slab begins to lift excessively .
Section 450-Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Conrete Pavement 450 7 .
Repeat this procedure in other holes until the voids are filled .
Do not plug the holes during grouting operations .
8 .
When edge drains are near the shoulder or pavement interface , take precautions to minimize the amount of grout that flows into the edge drain system .
Use the following procedure or an alternate approved by the Engineer to monitor grout flow into the edge drain system : a .
Drill one or more “ observation holes ” in the asphaltic concrete shoulder as close as possible to the shoulder or pavement interface .
b .
Time the grouting operation to prevent and stop excess grouting in a hole to ensure that grout does not flow into the edge drain system .
c. When grouting operations are complete , fill the “ observation holes ” with asphaltic concrete .
9 .
Prevent slabs from cracking during the undersealing operation .
Remove and replace slabs cracked during this operation at the Contractor ’ s expense according to Section 609 and Section 452 .
F. Cleaning Up Before permitting traffic on the section , remove grout deposits on the pavement or shoulders and clean the surface .
Remove debris , bags , spillage , etc. , from the Right-of-Way each day .
G. Permanently Sealing Holes Remove the grout from the holes and fill the holes with a stiff sand-cement mixture or an approved quick setting patching material .
Repair filled holes that ravel out or become damaged .

Calibrated Wrench Method Verification a .
Impact Wrench When using an impact wrench : 1 ) Tighten each of the three assemblies beyond snug tight .
2 ) Adjust the wrench to cut out at a tension no less than 5 to 10 percent higher than the appropriate tension shown in Table A : Required Fastener Tension .
Bolts tightened to this cut-out point should consistently develop the required minimum tension .
This cut-out point shall be the actual job-site setting .
b. Manual Torque Wrench When using a manual torque wrench : 1 ) Tighten each of the three assemblies beyond snug tight .
2 ) Note the torque required to induce a bolt tension 5 to 10 percent higher than the appropriate tension shown in Table A : Required Fastener Tension .
3 ) Measure torque with the nut in rotation .
4 ) Average the three tests to find the minimum torque to use for job-site installation tightening .
5 ) If the torque wrench produces erratic results , do not use that wrench .
3 .
Turn-of-Nut Method Verification When using the turn-of-nut method , tighten the three assemblies beyond snug tight to the appropriate rotation shown in Table B : Nut Rotation from Snug Tight .
Ensure that at this rotation , the minimum bolt tension is 5 to 10 percent higher than the appropriate tension shown in Table A : Required Fastener Tension .

b. Holes for turned bolts are subpunched or subdrilled .
c. Holes are carefully reamed after assembly to provide a light-driving fit with the bolt .
3 .
Accuracy of Punched , Subpunched , and Subdrilled Holes Accurately full-size punch , subpunch , or subdrill holes so that after assembly but before reaming , holes meet the following requirements : A cylindrical pin 1/8 in ( 3 mm ) smaller than the nominal diameter of the punched hole can enter perpendicular to the face of the member in at least 75 percent of the adjacent holes in the same plane without drifting .
A pin 3/16 in ( 5 mm ) smaller than the nominal diameter of the hole can pass through the hole .
If either of these requirements is not met , the faulty pieces will be rejected .
4 .
Reamed and Drilled Holes Ensure that reamed and full-sized drilled holes are cylindrical , perpendicular to the member , and 1/16 in ( 2 mm ) larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts .
Ream and drill holes as follows : a .

b .
Carefully adjust end connection angles and similar parts to the correct position and firmly hold them in place until bolted .
c. Fit up connections securely before placing bolts .
d. Ream or drill unfair holes ( holes that prevent the bolt from entering ) .
F. High Tensile-Strength Bolt Connections This section covers the shop and field connections of structural joints using High Tensile-Strength bolts tightened to a specified tension .
Use HTS structural bolts that meet the requirements of Subsection 852.2.03 , “ High Tensile-Strength Bolts. ” Furnish the bolts , nuts , and washers according to Subsection 852.2.03 .
To seat parts solidly , keep joint surfaces ( including those adjacent to the bolt heads , nut , or washers ) free of scale ( except tight mill scale ) , dirt , burrs , metal spatters , and other defects .
Ensure that joint contact surfaces are free of oil , grease , paint , lacquer , galvanizing , rust , and other matter .
Refer to the requirements of Subsection 535.3.05.C , “ Paint New Steel Structures ” step 5 .
Install fasteners with a hardened washer under the nut or bolt head , whichever is the element turned in tightening .
When the slope of the bolted-part surfaces contacting the bolt head and nut do not exceed 1:20 ( with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis ) , use a flat washer .
When the slope of an outer face of the bolted parts exceeds 1:20 , use a smooth , beveled washer .
If necessary , clip washers on one side to a point no closer than 85 percent of the bolt diameter from the center of the washer .
When a joint assembly is complete , ensure that each bolt has a tension 5 to 10 percent above the required minimum value shown in Table A : Required Fastener Tension .
G. High Tensile-Strength Bolt Tightening Methods Tighten HTS bolts with either the Calibrated Wrench Method or the Turn-of-Nut Method .
For both methods , conduct the final rotation of the nut or bolt ( whichever is the turned element ) from a snug-tight condition according to Table B : Nut Rotation from Snug Tight .
Snug tight is the tightness achieved when the plies of the joint are in firm contact .
Obtain this with a few impacts of an impact wrench or with full effort using an ordinary spud wrench .
Ensure that the snug tightening procedure produces 10 to 30 percent of the required fastener tension shown in Table A : Required Fastener Tension .
1 .
Calibrated Wrench Method Install bolts in the connection holes with a hardened washer under the turned element and bring the bolts up to snug tight ( described above ) as follows : Section 501-Steel Structures 532 a. Snug tighten systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges as follows : 1 ) Start the tightening pattern at the center of the pattern near the end of each member being spliced .
2 ) Work toward the edges of the splice plate .
b .
After the initial snug tightening , systematically tighten the bolts again as necessary using a similar tightening pattern until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted .
c. Following snug tightening , tighten the bolts in the connection using a calibrated wrench ( either air impact or manual torque ) .
Systematically tighten from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
d. After the first pass , systematically tighten the bolts again to ensure that bolts that may have relaxed from tightening adjacent bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount .
e. Operate impact wrenches until the wrench cuts out at the setting established by calibration .
If using a manual torque wrench , measure the target torque with the turned element in motion .
f. During installation in the assembled steel work , verify that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not rotate the nut or bolt head from snug tight more or less than that permitted in Table B : Nut Rotation from Snug Tight .
2 .
Turn-of-Nut Method When bolts are too short to fit in the tension calibrating device , use the Turn-of-Nut Method in the actual work .
Install bolt connection holes with a hardened washer under the turned element and bring the bolts up to snug tight ( described above ) as follows : a. Snug tighten the bolts using steps a and b of the Calibrated Wrench Method .
b .
Following snug tightening , tighten the bolts in the connection by the applicable amount of rotation specified in Table B : Nut Rotation from Snug Tight .
c. During the tightening operation , do not rotate the part not turned by the wrench .
d. Tighten systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges as follows 1 ) Start the tightening pattern at the center of the pattern near the end of each member being spliced .
2 ) Work toward the edges of the splice plate .

509.3.05 Construction A .
Contractor Options The Contractor may choose from these options when constructing the structure according to the Department plans : 1 .
Alternative Prestressing Systems The Contractor may use post-tensioning systems other than those shown on the Plans .
The alternative system may use wires , bars , or strands anchored with friction grips or bearings .
Unless the Plans allow , do not use prestressing systems that incorporate dead-end anchorages .
Choose alternative systems that can be stressed from either end unless the construction staging does not allow room to stress tendons from both ends .
In this case , use anchorage systems with compression plates or fittings to seat anchor wedges .
2 .
Alternative Stressing or Anchorage Blocks Stressing or anchorage blocks for the structure may deviate from those shown on the Plans .
Alternate stressing or anchorage blocks must be located inside the box .
Place the blocks in any of the following locations : At the juncture of the bottom of the top slab At the juncture of the top of the bottom slab and the web walls Within fillet areas in reinforced stressing blocks In partial depth diaphragms Section 509-Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning 573 Permanent or temporary stressing blockouts are allowed in the top of the top slab when post-tensioning ducts do not have a moisture-retaining low point .
B .
Install the Ducts Install ducts for prestressing steel as follows : 1 .
Support ducts at intervals of no more than 2 ft ( 600 mm ) .
The horizontal tolerance for longitudinal ducts in the top or bottom slab is plus or minus 1 in ( 25 mm ) .
The vertical tolerance for longitudinal ducts is plus or minus 1/4 in ( 6 mm ) .
2 .
Join rigid duct sections using positive metallic connections .
Connect the sections carefully to prevent misaligning the ducts at the joints .
3 .
Use waterproof tape at the connections .
4 .
Make duct splices so that the nose of the tendon being pushed into the duct goes from a male end into a female end .
This prevents tendons from catching on a duct end .
5 .
Stagger splices in ducts to prevent splices in the same location in a row of ducts .
Stagger the splices to give a 3 ft ( 900 mm ) longitudinal spacing from row to row .
6 .
Carefully cut and deburr the ends of ducts .
7 .
Use ducts or anchorage assemblies with pipes or other connections as grout ports for injecting grout after the prestressing .
Ports are required at each tendon anchorage .
8 .
Place continuous-draped longitudinal ducts in the web in one vertical row at the center of the web .
9 .
Tie the ducts securely to the saddles , which shall hold the duct in position during concrete placement and hardening .
10 .
Ensure that the clear distance between the ducts is 1-1/2 times the maximum size aggregate in the concrete mix or 1 in ( 25 mm ) whichever is greater .
11 .
Do not bundle ducts .
12 .
See Figure 3 below for an illustration of how to tie duct support saddles .
13 .
If needed , place ducts in the top or bottom slab in one of these ways : Horizontally at the variable spacings In closely and uniformly spaced groups The minimum horizontal clear spacing between ducts must be 3 in ( 75 mm ) .
14 .
Install at least one more continuity duct than needed in each web throughout the length of the structure .
This duct will be used during blockage and excessive prestress losses during construction .
15 .
Position the ends of the additional ducts to use anchorage blocks if necessary .
16 .
Vent continuity ducts over each intermediate support .
Provide vents with a diameter of at least 1/2 in ( 13 mm ) and made of either steel or polyethylene .
17 .
Provide vents at the low point of every duct to drain off water in the duct .
18 .
Connect vents to ducts using approved metallic structural fasteners .
19 .
Ensure that the vents are : Mortar tight Taped as necessary Sealable Capable of allowing grout to be injected through them 20 .
Immediately before installing the prestressing steel , demonstrate to the Engineer that ducts are unobstructed and free of water and debris .
Section 509-Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning 574 21 .
After installing ducts in the forms , keep the duct ends sealed to keep out water and debris .
22 .
After post-tensioning the steel , fill ducts with or without strands full of grout .
23 .
After the grout has set , remove the ends of the vents flush with the concrete surface .
Figure 3 : Partial Web View C. Install Reinforcing Steel Fabricate reinforcing steel and place it according to the Plans and Shop Drawings .

Section 509-Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning 575 D. Install Anchorages Secure post-tensioned prestressing steel at the ends using permanent anchoring devices recommended by the prestressing steel manufacturer and meeting the requirements herein .. Use anchoring devices that hold the prestressing steel at a load producing a stress of at least 95 percent of the guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the prestressing steel .
E. Install Distribution Devices Distribute the load from the anchoring device to the concrete using devices that conform to the following : The final unit compressive stress on the concrete directly underneath the plate or assembly does not exceed 3,000 psi ( 20 MPa ) or 0.9 ( f ” ci ) , whichever is less .
Bending stresses in the plates or assemblies induced by the pull of the prestressing steel do not exceed the yield point of the material or distort the anchorage plate as determined by the Engineer when 100 percent of the load is applied .
The Contractor may omit steel distribution plates or assemblies when furnishing large anchoring devices used with a steel grill embedded in concrete to distribute the compressive stresses to the concrete .
Install distribution devices as follows : 1 .
Place steel distribution plates , if used , inside the end surface of the member .
2 .
Recess anchoring devices so that the ends of the prestressing steel and all of the anchoring devices are embedded in concrete .

J. Post-Tension the Tendons Post-tension the tendons as follows : Section 509-Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning 576 1 .
Before post-tensioning tendons , ensure that the deck slab thickness and deck reinforcement cover comply with the Plan requirements .
2 .
Unless otherwise noted on the Plans or approved by the Engineer , wait to prestress cast-in-place concrete until the compressive strength of all the concrete placed reaches the required 28-day strength and the concrete is at least 14 days old .
If the Engineer approves , the Contractor may apply a portion of the prestressing force to a member with a concrete strength less than the value shown on the Plans .
Even with this partial prestressing , the Contractor must successfully construct the members .
3 .
Conduct the tensioning process so that the applied tension and the elongation can be measured .
4 .
Tension the prestressing steel using hydraulic jacks .
5 .
Tension the prestressing tendons in continuous post-tensioned members by jacking at each end of the tendon .
Jacking of both ends does not need to be done simultaneously .
6 .
When approved by the Engineer and if shown on the Plans , tension bent cap tendons by jacking from one end only .
7 .
Tension the prestressing tendons in simple span post-tensioned members by jacking from one end only .
8 .
When tensioning from one end of the tendon only , tension half of the prestressing steel in each member from one end and the other half from the opposite end of the span unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
9 .
Unless allowed on the Plans , do not use prestressing systems that incorporate dead-end anchorages .

14 .
Do not allow the total force at each section to drop below the total prestressing force specified .
However , the prestressing force may vary plus or minus 5 percent per tendon .
15 .
Unless otherwise specified on the Plans , ensure that the average working stress in the prestressing steel does not exceed 80 percent of the yield point stress of the prestressing steel .
16 .
To determine the amount of steel required , ensure that the maximum temporary tensile ( jacking ) stress in prestressing steel does not exceed 80 percent of its specified minimum ultimate tensile strength unless the Plans indicate a lower jacking stress .
17 .
Anchor the prestressing steel at stresses ( initial stress ) that will retain working forces at or higher than the minimum values shown on the Plans or approved by the Engineer .
Do not allow the initial stress to exceed 70 percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel .
18 .
Check that the loss of elongation from anchor set agrees with the anticipated value used in the stress calculations .
a .
Adjust measured Elongation to account for the actual measured anchor set .
b .
Maintain 5 percent agreement between the elongation and the stressing force .
Section 509-Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning 577 19 .
To compute the prestress losses from friction , use the formula in the AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridge , Article 9.16.1 .
The total friction losses at any section will be the sum of the effects for each tendon , depending on its anchorage location for each tendon .
20 .
To compute other prestress losses , use the AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridge , Article 9.16.2 .
21 .
After stressing and anchoring tendons and after the Engineer approves , trim projecting tendons by sawing as shown in the approved working drawings .

3 .
Storing Prestressed Concrete Piling Store piles as follows : Store piling in single layers directly on the ground only when there is uniform , level bearing for the full pile length .
To store piles in tiers , support the piling using blocks of uniform thicknesses placed immediately adjacent to the embedded pick-up points and in line vertically .
Store piling in groups of the same lengths .
4 .
Placing Piles in the Leads or in Position When picking up piles from storage and placing them in the leads or in position , use only the single pick-up point , marked with “ SP ” or a line painted on the pile at the plant , unless noted on the Plans or otherwise directed by the Engineer .
5 .
Driving Piles Do not subject prestressed concrete piling to excessive tensile stresses from combining a particular hammer with the soil conditions .
Excessive stress may occur , for example , in these situations : When encountering hard driving resistance at the point of a long pile When such situations damage pile , make changes to provide undamaged piling in place .
If piles are damaged , the Engineer may require the following : a .
Reduce the energy delivered to the piling by reducing the stroke , changing the cushioning , or using a lighter ram .
b .
Maintain equivalent energy but use a heavier or lighter ram with a different stroke .
c. Use a smaller hammer for the easier , initial driving .

Section 520-Piling 617 B .
Driving Head Use a structural steel driving head recommended by the manufacturer as suitable for the type and size of pile being driven .
The driving head shall : Hold the pile in the proper driving position Be constructed to prevent pile damage Be constructed to transmit the hammer energy along the pile axis Fit loosely enough around the pile head so that the pile can rotate slightly without binding C. Cushion or Shock Blocks Replace cushion blocks as necessary to prevent pile damage .
Inspect cushions periodically to ensure that they prevent pile damage .
1 .
Hammer Cushions Use cushions or shock blocks above the driving head to avoid damaging the pile .
Replace used hammer cushions reduced to half their original thickness with new cushions .
Use hammer cushions of a man-made material only such as micarta or aluminum .
Do not use materials such as plywood , hardwood , wire rope , and asbestos .
2 .
Pile Cushions For prestressed concrete piling up to 24 in ( 600 mm ) , provide a suitable pile cushion block for the top of the pile .
Use a cushion made of material that does not compress so far that the cushioning effect is lost .
For prestressed concrete piling , 30 in ( 750 mm ) and 36 in ( 900 mm ) square , use an approved solid hardwood pile cushion block at least 6 in ( 150 mm ) thick or an equivalent in the base of the hammer to cushion the hammer ram blow on the pile or follower .
3 .
Follower Cushions When a follower is permitted or required , use an approved , square-shaped laminated cushion block between the follower and the top of the pile .
Use a cushion block for a follower that is : At least 6 in ( 150 mm ) thick Made of 1 in ( 25 mm ) hardwood boards ( preferably green ) of uniform thicknesses Cut to fit the pile head Subsection 520.3.02.F , “ Followers , ” defines a follower within the scope of these Specifications .
D. Hammers Regardless of the requirements for hammers in these Specifications , the PDO governs in selecting the hammer .
The exception for this is the tabulations for prestressed concrete piling shown in the Energy Rating Table in Subsection 520.3.02.D.1.b .
Except for timber piling , drive piling with power hammers of an approved make and model ( steam or diesel ) that are single-acting ( open end diesel ) or double-acting ( enclosed ram diesel ) .
When desired , use gravity ( drop ) hammers to drive timber piling and , within the conditions in Subsection 520.3.02.D.2 , “ Gravity Hammers , ” steel H-piling and metal shell piling .
Hammer types and restrictions are as follows : 1 .
Power Hammers Maintain power hammers to obtain their potential stroke length and number of blows per minute .
Driving resistance values are invalid when these requirements are not met .
If driving resistance values are invalid , stop the driving operations and correct the problem .
Do not begin driving until the problem is resolved .
a .
Power Hammer Types Section 520-Piling 618 Power hammer types include : Steam Hammers .
Use steam or compressed air from boilers or air compressors to power steam hammers .
Use boilers and air compressors with an accurate pressure gauge and capacities and hose sizes at least equal to those specified by the hammer manufacturers .
Open-End Diesel Hammers .

Gravity Hammers When using a gravity hammer , regulate the drop height to avoid damaging the pile .
Do not allow the drop height to exceed 10 ft ( 3 m ) for timber piling and 12 ft ( 3.7 m ) for steel piling .
Ensure that the hammer is marked with its weight to the nearest 50 lbs ( 25 kg ) .
Upon the Engineer ’ s request , furnish a certified scale weight of the hammer .
Follow these gravity hammer restrictions : a .
Timber Piling .
Drive timber piling using a gravity hammer that weighs at least 2,000 lbs ( 900 kg ) but no more than 3,500 lbs ( 1500 kg ) .
However , ensure that the hammer has enough weight to obtain the PDO with a maximum fall of 10 ft ( 3 m ) .
b .
Steel Piling .
If desired , substitute a gravity hammer for a power hammer when the quantity of a steel piling type shown on the Bridge Plans Summary of Quantities does not exceed 800 linear ft ( 245 linear meters ) , including test pile lengths if any , for that pile type for an individual bridge .
When using a gravity hammer within the scope of the linear foot ( meter ) condition , ensure that it has enough weight to obtain the PDO with a maximum fall of 12 ft ( 3.7 m ) .
The maximum allowable hammer weight is 5,000 lbs ( 2300 kg ) .
c. Prestressed Concrete Piling .
Do not use gravity hammers to drive prestressed concrete piling .
E. Leads Equip pile driving rigs with leads that allow the hammer to move freely and support piling during driving .
Use leads that meet the following requirements : The vertical axis of the leads and hammer coincide with the vertical axis of the pile .
The leads are long and rigid enough to hold the pile in accurate alignment while it is being driven .
However , ensure that the driving rig can slightly adjust the lead position to compensate for minor changes in direction while driving .
When the pile is supported by the material being penetrated or by approved templates , use hammer leads only .
Driving in deep water may require special platform-type templates to ensure piling stability and position ( see Subsection 520.1.03.A , “ Template Plan for Positioning Piling ” ) .
Use templates with enough area to accommodate all persons necessary to perform and inspect the work .
The Engineer may require templates in other necessary locations to ensure piling stability and position .
F. Followers Do not use inserts of similar type piling placed between the hammer and a pile to keep the hammer above water level or other levels .
Section 520-Piling 620 Within the scope of these Specifications , a follower is part of the driving mechanism used to drive larger-sized prestressed concrete piling .
Position the follower between the pile head and the hammer driving base to evenly distribute the driving energy across the concrete area of voided-type piling .
Always use followers when driving 36 in ( 900 mm ) prestressed concrete piling .
The Department allows followers when driving 30 in ( 750 mm ) prestressed concrete piling .
G. Spuds Use spuds heavy enough to penetrate through strata or a stratum of firm or hard material to reach the necessary depth .
Control the alignment for battered spudding using templates that maintain the batter .
Unless otherwise permitted , use templates to control vertical spudding .
Mark the distance from the top of the spud clearly at 2 ft ( 600 mm ) intervals along the length of the stem .
Use either round or square spud tips for pile driving that meet the following requirements : At least as large as the pile to be driven at the spudding location If round , no more than approximately 2 in ( 50 mm ) larger than the diameter or diagonal dimension of the pile If square , no more than approximately 2 in ( 50 mm ) larger than the lateral dimension or diameter of the pile H. Jetting Equipment Provide enough pumping capacity , using at least two jets , to produce a volume and pressure that will freely erode the material next to the pile and the material 6 in ( 150 mm ) below the pile tip .
I. Loading Test Equipment Furnish the necessary material , tools , equipment ( including a constant tension wire with a weight and sheave or a weight and round pin ) , and incidentals to properly install the complete loading test and a temporary shelter over the area if the Engineer requires it .
520.3.03 Preparation A .
Remove Obstacles Unless otherwise permitted , remove or cut out portions of obstacles that interfere with attaining the PDO .
This will be measured and paid for as described in Subsection 520.4.01.A , “ Removing Obstacles. ” B .
Form the Embankment at Bridge Ends Before driving piling at bridge ends and unless otherwise shown on the Plans , form the embankment as follows : 1 .
Make the embankment at bridge ends full depth to the subgrade template except for the stage construction providing a bench for the end bent .
2 .
Thoroughly compact the embankment as provided in the Specifications .
3 .
When the Plans or Special Provisions require a waiting period , delay the construction of all or portions of the bridge as required .
The minimum acceptable length of completed full-depth embankment is specified in Subsection 101.11 , “ Bridge. ” 520.3.04 Fabrication General Provisions 101 through 150 .
Section 520-Piling 621 520.3.05 Construction A .
Determine the Pile Length Use full-length piling when possible , but always use full-length timber piling .
Use piling long enough to reach the PDO .
Except for test piles shown on the Plans , pile lengths are based on the lengths assumed to remain in the completed structure .
Provide fresh headings and the additional length necessary to suit the method of operation at no additional expense to the Department .
Pile lengths or quantities shown on the Plans are for estimating purposes only .
The Engineer ’ s “ Length List ” will be available only after the test piles that logically cover the listed bents have been driven and evaluated and required load tests have been performed .
The written “ Length List ” itemizes the number , type , size , and length of pile required per bent .
1 .
Steel H-Piling or Metal Shell Piling Lengths Determine and furnish the required lengths of piling in place to reach the PDO , regardless of whether the Plans require test piles or show estimated lengths .
To determine these lengths of piling in place , either drive test piles , make borings , or make other investigations at no additional expense to the Department .
2 .
Timber Piling Lengths Have the Department determine the lengths of this piling .
Furnish the piling either according to the Plan listing or according to the Engineer ’ s “ Length List , ” as directed .
Lengths for timber piling up to 40 ft ( 12 m ) will be given in 1 ft ( 300 mm ) increments .
Lengths for timber piling over 40 ft ( 12 m ) will be given in 2 ft ( 600 mm ) increments .
3 .
Prestressed Concrete Piling Lengths Have the Department determine the lengths of this piling .
Furnish the piling according to the Plan listing or the Engineer ’ s “ Length List , ” as directed .
Lengths for prestressed concrete piling 18 in ( 450 mm ) square or smaller will be given in 2-1/ 2 ft ( 750 mm ) increments .
a .
Additional Lengths for Prestressed Concrete Piling .
If a prestressed concrete pile , including test pile , is driven below cutoff elevation before reaching the PDO , the Engineer will determine the net additional length required and add this extension length to the written “ Length List. ” b .
Composite Prestressed Concrete Piling Lengths .
The composite pile length of composite prestressed concrete piling ( with steel H-section tips partially embedded in and partially protruding from the concrete ) , is the end-to- end length of the concrete .
The total length of the steel H-section and its embedded and protruding tips is as shown on the Plans .
The steel sections are incidental to the work .
B .
Drill Pilot Holes When pilot holes are required , drill them to the diameter and approximate depth specified on the Plans .
Backfill voids and holes with sand or other suitable granular material , or other material as indicated on the Plans .
This backfill is an incidental part of the work .
The following are not considered pilot holes : Holes created by spudding ( punching ) Holes dug to drive piling that is too long to fit leads Holes dug to replace a template ( if permitted ) Where pilot holes are required in granular material and the material can not be sealed off using “ mudding ” drilling methods , drill the pilot hole as follows : Section 520-Piling 622 1 .
Place a casing pipe with a large enough diameter around the boring device .
2 .
Hold the casing in position until the pilot hole is completed and the pile driving progresses deep enough into the hard material to keep loose material out of the pilot hole .
Drilling pilot holes using casing is incidental to the work .
C. Test Piling The Plans will normally require test piles only with timber and prestressed concrete piling , including composite piling .
However , the Department may require steel H or metal shell test piles .
When the Plans show the design load of a pile as well as a PDO , the design load is shown only for information purposes if a loading test is required .
Ensure that the piling to be loaded is of the size and type and at the locations specified on the Plans or designated by the Engineer .
The Engineer may revise the quantity or location of the Department ’ s test piles .
The Department may designate locations on the Plans where the Engineer will record pile driving data during driving operations .
Such piles are designated as “ Driving Data Piles. ” Follow these requirements when driving : Ensure that the cross-sectional dimensions of test piles are the same as the piles that will be part of the completed structure .
Test piles are generally longer than piles that remain in the completed structure .
Regardless of the PDO , drive test piles to their full length , where possible , for exploratory purposes .
Drive test piles of the length , type , and size designated on the Plans in the locations the Engineer specifies .
When using timber test piles , peel the piles and drive them next to the piles that will be part of the completed structure .
If desired , machine-peel timber test piles and leave them untreated .
Drive other types of test piles so that they become part of the completed structure .
Ensure that test piles furnished and driven in permanent locations meet the requirements in Subsection 520.3.05.D.1 , “ Determine Driving Resistance , ” and Subsection 520.3.05.A.1 , “ Steel H-Piling or Metal Shell Piling Lengths. ” Drive test piles to determine required lengths in the Engineer ’ s presence .
Cooperate with the Engineer to obtain the required data on “ Driving Data Piles ” as an incidental part of the work .
“ Driving Data Piles ” do not need to be driven before other piling .
D. Evaluate Bearing Capacity Determine the bearing capacity of piling by determining driving resistance , performing loading tests , or doing a combination of these .
Determine driving resistance for all piling driven regardless of PDO requirements .
1 .
Determine Driving Resistance Drive a pile in one continuous operation and determine the driving resistance without delays .
However , in soft material the Contractor may , at the Engineer ’ s discretion , determine the driving resistance after delaying driving operations .
Determine the driving resistance of the piling using the appropriate formula for the hammer type .
These resistance formulas apply only when : The hammer has a free fall .
The head of the pile is not broomed , crushed , spalled , or excessively crimped .
The penetration rate is reasonably uniform .
Section 520-Piling 623 Determining driving resistance by formula is not a Pay Item .

Perform Loading Test Unless otherwise specified on the Plans , use a test method that conforms to ASTM D 1143 , modified for quick load tests .
Use loading apparatus capable of the lesser value of the following : For concrete piles , 400 percent of the design load or 500 tons ( 4450 kilonewtons ) For steel piles , 400 percent of the design load or 90 percent of the yield strength The Engineer may increase or decrease the number of loading tests .
Furnish and read the instrumentation necessary to determine the pile settlement under load .
A loaded pile is unsatisfactory when the total settlement under 200 percent of the design load exceeds 1 in ( 25 mm ) or the permanent settlement exceeds 1/4 in ( 6 mm ) using the standard loading procedure in ASTM D 1143 Section 5 .
The laboratory will determine the maximum safe design load or the failure load of original loading materials based on the results of the loading test .
The Engineer may require the following piles to be driven further : Unsatisfactory piles as defined in the paragraphs above Piles without enough maximum safety design or failure loads as determined by the Office of Materials Perform the loading test as follows : a .
Test load piling as required on the Plans , or as directed by the Engineer .
b. Furnish and drive the piling to be test loaded .

d. Apply the test loads in equal increments of 10 to 15 percent of the design load .
e. Apply the loads at constant 2-1/2-minute time intervals throughout the test .
f. After the test is complete , remove the temporary materials .
These temporary materials remain the Contractor ’ s property .
g. Remove or cut off the piling that will not remain in the completed structure .
Cut off the piling at least 1 ft ( 300 mm ) below the bottom of the footing or the ground line , whichever applies .
h. In deep water , have the Engineer direct how much pile to remove .
E. Drive Piling Drive piling to the PDO shown on the Plans .
When the PDO involves only a driving resistance requirement , the Engineer will determine the depth to drive piling .
If there is no Plan PDO , drive the piling as directed by the Engineer .
If the Engineer determines that driving results and loading test results require modification , drive the piling to a PDO modified by the Department .
Drive piling as follows : Section 520-Piling 625 1 .
When using pilot holes , drive the piling enough to fix the point firmly and reach the PDO .

Redrive piles that are raised or moved while driving adjacent piling .
G. Jet and Spud Jetting and , unless otherwise noted in the Contract , spudding are considered incidental to the Work .
Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer , do not jetting or spudding operations lower than 3 ft ( 900 mm ) above the estimated final elevation of the pile tip , or lower than 3 ft ( 900 mm ) above the specified Minimum Tip Elevation to obtain minimum penetration .
When jetting or spudding to drive a prestressed concrete pile , ensure that the pile point is well seated with reasonable soil resistance at the point before using full driving energy .
1 .
Jetting When the Engineer permits , use jetting to properly position a pile .
Additional driving may be required to determine the final driving resistance when piles are positioned by jetting .
Should additional driving require additional length , the additional expense involved is considered incidental to the Work .
Jetting may be required with any hammer or piling type ( including test piling ) and at any site .
However , jet only when directed or permitted by the Engineer and as follows : a .
Do not use jets where the Engineer determines that the jets may endanger the stability of embankments or other improvements .

L. Use Prestressed Concrete Piling Piles cracked in transportation , handling , or storage may be rejected by the Engineer as defective piles if the cracking indicates structural damage .
Piles with cracks that are not structurally damaging that will not be used in sea water or alkali soils may be accepted by the Engineer if the cracks close and are not visible when the pile is in the leads .
When using prestressed concrete piling , comply with the following : Do not drive prestressed concrete piles until they reach a minimum strength of 5,000 psi ( 35 MPa ) and a minimum age of 5 days .
Form vent holes for voided-type piles in one face of each pile at approximately 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) on the centers .
Ensure that these holes remain open permanently .
After completing the driving , cut back and point over cable loops used as embedded pick-up points that remain above the ground or water line .
M. Use Metal Shell Piling Metal shell piling consists of steel shells filled with Class A concrete after they are driven in place and cut off .
Ensure that the shell ’ s minimum wall thickness is 1/4 in ( 6 mm ) unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
However , furnish shells thick and rigid enough that they can be driven to the PDO without crimping , buckling , or distorting .
The Contractor may use either of the following : Shells of constant section Shells that meet the requirements of Subsection 855.2.02 , “ Fluted Steel Shell Pile ” Use metal shell piling as follows : 1 .

Ensure that driven shells are clean and free of water immediately before placing concrete .
Use a suitable light to inspect the entire length of the shell in place .
5 .
Before placing concrete , examine the shells for collapse or diameter reduction .
Shells that are broken or are collapsed enough that bearing capacity is materially decreased will be rejected as defective piles .
Fill rejected shells that can not be removed with Class A concrete at no expense to the Department .
6 .
When reinforcement steel is required , rigidly assemble and lower it into the shell so that its position is correct during concrete placement .
Section 520-Piling 630 Figure 2 Section 520-Piling 631 7 .
Ensure that there are no loose reinforcement steel bars .
8 .
Do not place concrete in the shells until completing driving within a 30 ft ( 9 m ) radius or until driving shells in any one bent or footing .
If this is not possible , stop the driving within the radius limit until the concrete in the last shell filled reaches a minimum strength of 2,000 psi ( 14 MPa ) .
The Engineer may adjust the 30 ft ( 9 m ) limit according to the prevailing vibration conditions .

Section 617-Permanent Anchored Walls 777 C. Rock Anchors 1 .
When required on the Plan or by the Engineer , use a prestressed rock anchor made of high-strength steel tendon fitted with a stressing anchorage at one end and a way to transfer force to the grout and rock on the other end .
2 .
Insert the rock anchor tendon into a prepared hole of suitable length and diameter , fixed to the rock , and stressed to a specified force .
The basic components of a prestressed rock anchor are as listed below : a. Prestressing steel may be single or multiple wires , strands , or bars .
The rock anchor length is composed of these two parts : Bond length ( socket ) —the portion of the anchor that transmits the force to the surrounding rock Free length ( stressing length ) —the portion of the anchor free to elongate elastically during stressing b .
The stressing anchorage is the device that permits the stressing and anchoring of the prestressing steel under load .
c. The fixed anchorage is a mechanism opposite the stressing anchorage on the tendon that transfers the induced force to the surrounding grout or rock .
Deformed bars and strand tendons do not have fixed anchorages since the anchor load is transferred to the grout by bond .
d. Provide grout , vent pipes , and miscellaneous appurtenances to inject the anchor grout .
Pump grout through the drill casing or rods .
D. Rock Anchor Installation Install the rock anchors as follows : 1 .
Before installation , visit the site to observe existing conditions that may affect the work or design , if applicable , and to review the geotechnical data available for the Project .
2 .
Drive or drill the holes for the anchors by core drilling , rotary drilling , auger drilling , or percussion drilling .
If using water in the drilling operation , dispose of the water to minimize wall erosion .
Repair water erosion damage to the site at no cost to the Department .
3 .
If the hole will not stand open , install casing to maintain a clean and open hole .
Ensure that the hole diameter is at least 3 in ( 75 mm ) if no pressure grouting is used .
Pressure grouting is grouting with a pressure greater than 60 psi ( 415 kPa ) .
4 .
Ensure that the drill bit diameter is not less than 1/8 in ( 3 mm ) smaller than the specified hole diameter .
5 .

Do not allow holes to deviate from a straight line by more than 1 to 2 in .
( 25 to 50 mm ) in 10 ft. ( 3 m ) .
Do not allow holes to extend outside the Right-of-Way limits .
Thoroughly clean holes of rock dust , rock chips , grease , or other material before inserting the tendon .
6 .
Install the tendon in the casing or in a hole drilled for the anchor .
Ensure that the tendon ’ s corrosion protection is not damaged during handling or installation .

NOTE : Do not use anchors to ground electric equipment and do not subject anchor tendons to sharp bends .
9 .
Provide centralizers spaced a maximum of 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) center to center throughout the bond length .
Do not use wood spacers or other material harmful to the tendon steel or sheathing .
10 .
Inject the grout at the lowest point of the anchor and place over the entire anchor length .
a .
Ensure that the grouting equipment can continuously mix and produce lump-free grout .
Section 617-Permanent Anchored Walls 778 Equip the grout pump nozzle with a grout pressure gauge capable of measuring pressure of at least 150 psi , ( 10 kPa ) or twice the actual pressure used .
b .
Base the material proportions used in the grout on grout tests made before beginning the grouting .
Or , select the proportions based on prior documented experience with similar materials and equipment under comparable field conditions .
c. Use the minimum water content necessary for proper placement and do not exceed a water-cement ratio of 0.45 .
Do not leave grout in the mixer longer than 45 minutes .
Only fill voids at the top of the free length with grout after final lock-off .
11 .
After grouting , do not disturb the tendon until the grout has reached a cube strength of 3,500 psi ( 25 MPa ) .
Keep the mouth of the hole clean after grouting .
Record the following data in a Project field book during the grouting operation : Type of mixer Water-cement ratio Type of additives Grout pressure Type cement Test sample strengths ( before stressing ) Volume of grout placed in bond and free lengths 12 .
If using pressure grouting , choose whether to perform a watertightness test .
However , if injecting grout with a pressure of 60 psi ( 415 kPa ) or less , always perform a watertightness test .
Perform the test as follows : a .
Fill the entire hole in the rock with water and subject it to a pressure of 5 psi ( 35 kPa ) in excess of the hydrostatic head as measured at the top of the hole .
b .
If after 10 minutes the leakage rate from the hole exceeds 0.001 gal per inch diameter per foot of depth per minute ( 12 mL per 25 mm diameter per meter of depth per minute ) , consolidate grout , redrill , and retest the hole .
If the second watertightness test fails , repeat the entire process .
c. During the tests , observe holes adjacent to the hole being tested for watertightness to detect and seal inter-hole connections .
d. If finding artesian or flowing water in the drilled hole , maintain the pressure on the consolidation grout until the grout has initially set .
E. Cutting of Tendon Protrusions After the Engineer accepts an anchor , the portion of the anchored tendon protruding over the anchor may be cut if it is not required for use in retesting .
Cut the tendon according to the tendon manufacturer ’ s recommendations as approved by the Engineer .
Do not damage the tendon anchor .
F. Redesign If the anchors fail during performance tests or proof tests , modify the design or construction tests and procedures .
The design is subject to Department review .
These modifications may include : Reducing the anchor design load by increasing the number of anchors Increasing the grout pressure Requiring post-grouting or increasing the bond length Modify the design or construction procedures , install the redesigned anchors in the wall , and test as previously defined at no cost to the Department .
Anchors that fail the performance or proof tests may be incorporated in the wall .
Propose a reduced design load and retest as noted above .
The Department will determine acceptance of such anchors .

Undesirable characteristics are high volume change properties and/or low densities .
The bearing values are unpredictable .
The Department recommends testing these materials in a laboratory , where possible , before use .
One exception is District 6 , where chert clay soils are prevalent .
Chert clay soils ( IIIC4 ) with less than 55 % passing the No .
10 ( 2 mm ) sieve may be considered suitable for subgrade materials .
These soils are found generally in the northwest corner of the state in Dade , Walker , Catoosa , Whitfield , Murray , Chattooga , Gordon , and Floyd counties .
Class IV Highly organic soils or peat , muck , and other unsatisfactory soils generally found in marshy or swampy areas .
Class V Shaly materials that are not only finely laminated but have detrimental weathering properties and tend to disintegrate .
Class VI Rock or boulders that can not be readily incorporated into the embankment by layer construction , and that contain insufficient material to fill the interstices when they are placed .

Definition and Limitation of Defects Decay : Disintegration of the wood substance due to wood-destroying fungi .
The words “ dote ” and “ rot ” mean the same as decay .
Red heart is a form of decay .
Compression Wood : An abnormal , dense , hard growth frequently occurring on the underside of limbs and leaning trunks of coniferous trees .
It is characterized by very wide and eccentric annual growth rings and includes what appears to be an exceptional proportion of summerwood growth .
The contrast in color between springwood and summerwood , however , is usually less in compression wood than in normal wood .
Turpentine Butt : A scar caused from bleeding the trees to obtain turpentine .
Scar : A damaged surface caused from injury to the tree during growth .
Sweep : Deviation of a piece or stick from a straight line measured from the center of one end to the center of the other end .
A straight line from the center of the butt to the center of the tip shall lie entirely within the body of the pile .
Short Crook : A crook in which the direction of the piece or stick changes in a very short distance measured lengthwise .
Burst Check : A crack approximately at right angles to the annual rings , usually radial cracks in sticks from the center or from near the center to the outside , or a combination of this crack and a ring shake caused through either seasoning , exposure to high temperature , or the process of preservative treatment .
Unsound Knot : A knot solid across the face , but containing incipient decay .
Cluster Knot : Two or more knots grouped together , the fibers of the wood being deflected around the entire unit .
A group of single knots with fibers deflected around each knot separately is not a cluster , even though the knots may be close together .
Punk Knot : A fungus decay that extends from the interior of the piece of pile to the outside , which when prodded is usually found to contain a snuff-like substance .
Ring Knots : Three or more knots appearing in the same line of circumference , or any foot of length .

NOTE : Do not use strands from more than one source in any one tensioning operation .
Ensure the method used meets these requirements : 1 ) Strand Splices : Get approval from the Engineer for splicing methods and devices .
Jacking Method Action Single-strand Use only one splice per strand .
Multi-strand Splice all strands or no more than 10 % of the strands .
Ensure that the spliced strands have similar physical properties , are from the same source , and have the same “ twist ” or “ lay. ” Locate splices outside the prestressed units .
2 ) Wire Failures : The Engineer may accept wire failures if the area of broken wires does not exceed 2 percent of the total area of the strands .
3 ) Stressing Preparations : Prepare the members as follows : a ) Carefully place and thread all strands in the bed .
b ) Avoid contaminating the strand with oil , grease , or other bond breaking material .
If any strand is contaminated , clean the strand with a suitable solvent or replace the strand .
Section 865-Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members 1254 c ) After final stressing , position all strands within the location tolerances specified in Subsection 865.2.01.B.11 .
d ) Use strand vises designed for the size of pretensioning strand to anchor the strand .
e ) After anchoring , ensure that the vises sustain the pretensioning force without slipping until the release of stress .
Ensure that the vise grips seat no more than 1/4 in ( 6 mm ) each .
f ) To prevent strands from bonding together , encase the strand in a conduit that can resist the pressure exerted by the concrete .
g ) Use conduit with an ID allowing free movement of the encased strand , but no greater than the diameter of the strand plus 1/8 in ( 3 mm ) .
h ) Secure the conduit to prevent both longitudinal movement along the strand and bonding at the location shown on the Plans , ± 1 in ( 25 mm ) .
i ) Tape the conduit to keep concrete out .
Use tape and conduit manufactured from a non-corrosive material compatible with both the concrete and steel .
Do not debond the strand for the full length of members .
4 ) Pretensioning Operation : Use elongation to control this operation .
Ensure that the hydraulic pressure gauge readings at the time of the measured net elongation are within 5 percent of the calculated gauge reading for that particular elongation .
Ensure that the net elongation and final gauge measurements agree within ± 5 percent of their computed theoretical values .
The measurements of force and elongation shall algebraically agree with each other within a 5 % tolerance .
If any measurement varies by more than 5 percent , the Department will stop all work .
Correct the defect before proceeding .
Pretension the members as follows : a ) Initial Tension : After threading the strand in the bed , apply an initial tensioning force to each strand .
Do not use elongation to measure the amount of initial tension , but use a dynamometer , hydraulic jack gauge , or dead weight .
b ) Final Tension : Calculate the final stress from the final elongation measured between established reference points .
Use points that are independent of any movement in the bed or anchorages that might occur during the pretensioning operation .
Calculate the design elongation as follows : D PL AE where D = Design elongation in inches ( millimeters ) .
P = Tensioning force , in pounds ( kilonewtons ) ; subtract the initial tensioning force from P. L = Distance from dead end anchorage to reference point , measured in inches ( millimeters ) A = Cross-sectional area of strand , in square inches ( millimeters ) .
E = Modulus of elasticity of strand , in pounds per square inch ( MPa ) .
c ) Add correction factors to the design elongation for strand anchorage slip and temperature .
Correct any movement in the anchorage abutments or in the overall anchorage system .
Use the final elongation figure as the net elongation in jacking the strand .
d ) Single-Strand Jacking : Do not let the jack ram rotate more than one revolution while stressing any strand .
e ) Draped Strand Jacking : Partially jack draped strands from the end of the bed to add tension .
Raise or lower the strands to their final position to get the final tension .
Ensure that the strands have no more than four points where the strand changes slope , two of which shall be at each anchorage .
Section 865-Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members 1255 Use approved , low friction devices at pick-up and hold-down points .

Uniformly distribute stress in the strands throughout the bed length .
5 ) Detensioning Operation : Before detensioning , submit the pattern and schedule for releasing the strands to the Engineer for advance approval .
Detension the members as follows : a ) Strip or loosen forms that tend to restrict the horizontal or vertical movement of the member prior to releasing the stress .
b ) If curing with steam , carefully release the strand because of dimensional changes due to temperature and shrinkage changes .
Where possible , release the pretensioned strand while the units are moist and warm .
c ) In deflected strand construction , immediately release the hold down devices within the member or members after curing with steam .
6 ) Stress Release Strength : You may transfer stress to the concrete , unless otherwise specified on the Plans or in the Special Provisions , based on the following requirements ( minimum strength determined by cylinders cast of the same concrete ) : Section Minimum Strength Age Concrete I-beams , box beams , flat slab deck sections , or tee slab deck sections 4500psi ( 30 MPa ) 18 hrs Piling 4000 psi ( 28 MPa ) Other members As specified on the Plans 7 ) Strand Release : Use the following table for each type of strand : Type of Strand Release Single strand Heat each strand and allow it to pull itself apart in the sequence of the approved pattern and schedule of release .
Do not cut the strands .
Multiple strand Release either a symmetrical group of strands or all of the strands simultaneously .
Remove the load on the strands from the anchorage and place it on the jacking system .
Gradually release the jack or jacks until the strands are relaxed .
Draped strand Release according to a method where the weight of the beam is compared with twice the total amount of the vertical components of the hold-down forces .
* Section 865-Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members 1256 * Use one of the following two methods : Method Release as follows : Method I ( beam weight less than twice the total amount and vertical restraints can not counteract the vertical components of the hold- down forces ) Heat each draped strand at the end of each member to failure in the sequence of the approved pattern and schedule of release .
Release hold-downs and remove hold-down bolts .
Release straight strands as noted in Subsection 865.2.01.B.7.a .
( 7 ) Method II ( beam weight more than twice the total amount ) Release hold-down devices within the beam .
Release the strands from the top to the bottom by either heating or jacking in the sequence of the approved pattern and schedule of release .

Post-tensioning Operation : In general , tension straight tendons from one end .
Simultaneously tension draped tendons from each end .
Pretension the members as follows : 1 ) Initial Tension : After threading the tendon in the duct , apply an initial tensioning force of up to 5 percent of the final tensioning force with a jack .
Determine the initial tension by reading the gauge .
Do not use elongation to measure the amount of initial tension .
2 ) Final Tension : Compute the final stress on tendons from the amount of the final elongation measurement , checked by the jack pressure gauge reading .
3 ) Gauge Reading : Ensure that the pressure gauge reading at the time of the measured elongation is within 5 percent of the calculated gauge reading for that particular elongation .
If the gauge pressure reading varies by more than 5 percent from the calculated reading , stop the stressing operation and correct the defect before proceeding .
Section 865-Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members 1257 4 ) Jacking : While jacking draped tendons , ensure that jack pressures and elongations are kept as near equal as is possible at each of the two jacks so the elongation measurements and jack pressures remain proportional .
5 ) Anchor Devices : Design anchor devices that secure the tendon for the size of post-tensioning tendon used .
After anchoring , ensure that the devices can maintain a prestressed load of 150 percent of the maximum design load and do not slip more than 1/8 in ( 3 mm ) after anchoring .
Place anchor devices exactly at right angles to the axes of the post-tensioned tendons .
Carefully note anchorage losses and take the proper corrective measures to ensure that the tendon has the final design stress .
