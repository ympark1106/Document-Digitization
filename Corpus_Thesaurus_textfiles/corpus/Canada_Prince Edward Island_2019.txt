501.03 Method of Measurement The quantity to be measured for payment under this section shall be the number of tonnes of asphalt cement utilized by the Contractor in producing hot mix asphaltic concrete as determined by calibrated asphalt cement pump metered settings logged by the Department as metered into the mix and calculated for the tonnage of hot mix asphaltic concrete produced .
501.04 Basis of Payment The supply and transportation of performance grade asphalt cement will be paid for at the Contractor ’ s unit bid price per tonne of asphalt cement .
This price shall be full compensation for any and all expenses that may be incurred for the supply , transport and delivery of the performance grade asphalt cement to the Contractor ’ s plant , including the cost of any anti-stripping additive required to meet design mix requirements as well as any storage , heating and handling requirements .
The unit bid price per tonne of PG Grade asphalt cement specified shall be adjusted using the PG Grade 58-28 price index as posted 48 hours prior to closing of tender and the time when the asphalt cement is incorporated into the work .
The price index to be used for comparison shall be the price as determined in the Maritime Suppliers Rack Price or as artificially established by the Department in the Special Provisions .
A link to the index can be found at : https : //princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/transportation-infrastructure/monthly-average-asphalt-binder- rack-price-2008 The payment adjustment will be in dollars per tonne of asphalt binder .
A payment adjustment will be established for each month of paving in which the price index for the month differs by more than $ 10/tonne from the posted price index at the time in which tenders for the Contract were opened .
When the price index differential is less than $ 10/tonne there will be no GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY ASPHALT CEMENT 501 2019.01.14 501-2 adjustment established for that month .
The payment adjustment for the month will be calculated as follows , where : PA = Payment Adjustment for asphalt binder in dollars T = Posted PG asphalt binder price index at the time of Tender Opening P = PG asphalt binder price index for month of paving Q = Quantity of asphalt binder in tonnes When P > ( T + $ 10/tonne ) , the Contractor receives an additional payment from the Owner as follows : PA = ( P - ( T + $ 10/tonne ) ) x Q When P < ( T - $ 10/tonne ) , the Owner deducts from payments due to the Contractor as follows : PA = ( T - $ 10/tonne ) - P ) x Q Examples : 1 .
A Contractor ’ s unit bid price for asphalt cement was $ 325 for a tender that closed in February .
The posted price index 48 hours prior to tender closing was $ 283.75 and the work was undertaken in May when the price index was $ 293.25 .
$ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 293.25 ) falls within the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing there would be no adjustment to the unit price of the asphalt cement .

A Contractor ’ s unit bid price for asphalt cement was $ 325 for a tender that closed in February .
The posted price index 48 hours prior to tender closing was $ 283.75 and the work was undertaken in June when the price index was $ 260.00 and 250t of cement was used .
$ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 260.00 ) falls outside the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing an adjustment to the amount paid to the Contractor would be required .
The price would be adjusted using the P < ( T - $ 10/tonne ) formula .
Thus the Owner will deduct the following amount from payment to the Contractor : PA = ( ( 283.75 - 10 ) - 260 ) x 250 = $ 3437.50 3 .
A Contractor ’ s unit bid price for asphalt cement was $ 325 for a tender that closed in February .
The posted price index 48 hours prior to tender closing was $ 283.75 and the work was undertaken in August when the price index was $ 310 and 250t of cement was used .
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY ASPHALT CEMENT 501 2019.01.14 501-3 $ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 310.00 ) falls outside the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing an adjustment to the amount paid to the Contractor would be required .
The price would be adjusted using the P > ( T + $ 10/tonne ) formula .
Thus the Owner will add the following amount to the payment to the Contractor : PA = ( 310 - ( 283.75 + 10 ) ) x 250 = $ 4062.50 Section 502 Rescinded 2018 Section 502 Rescinded 2018 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY ASPHALT PRIME 502 18.01.15 502-1 502.01 Scope This Section is the material specification for asphalt prime .

A payment adjustment will be established for each month of paving in which the price index for the month differs by more than $ 10/tonne from the price index for the month in which tenders for the Contract were opened .
When the price index differential is less than $ 10/tonne there will be no adjustment established for that month .
The payment adjustment for the month will be calculated as follows , where : PA = Payment Adjustment for asphalt binder in dollars T = PG asphalt binder price index for the month of Tender Opening P = PG asphalt binder price index for month of paving Q = Quantity of asphalt binder in tonnes When P > ( T + $ 10/tonne ) , the Contractor receives an additional payment from the Owner as follows : PA = ( P - ( T + $ 10/tonne ) ) x Q When P < ( T - $ 10/tonne ) , the Owner deducts from payments due to the Contractor as follows : PA = ( ( T - $ 10/tonne ) - P ) x Q Examples : 1 .
A Contractors unit bid price for asphalt cement was $ 325 for a tender that closed in February .
The posted price index 48 hours prior to tender closing was $ 283.75 and the work was undertaken in May when the price index was $ 293.25 .
$ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 293.25 ) falls within the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing there would be no adjustment to the unit price of the asphalt cement .

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY HOT MIX ASPHALTIC CONCRETE - END RESULT SPECIFICATION ( ERS ) 609.06/07 2013.01.15 609.06/07-9 $ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 260.00 ) falls outside the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing an adjustment to the amount paid to the Contractor would be required .
The price would be adjusted using the P < ( T - $ 10/tonne ) formula .
Thus , the Owner will deduct the following amount from payment to the Contractor : PA = ( ( 283.75 - 10 ) - 260 ) x 250 = $ 3437.50 3 .
A Contractors unit bid price for asphalt cement was $ 325 for a tender that closed in February .
The posted price index 48 hours prior to tender closing was $ 283.75 and the work was undertaken in August when the price index was $ 310 and 250t of cement was used .
$ 283.75 - $ 10 = $ 273.75 $ 283.75 + $ 10 = $ 293.75 Since the price index at time of paving ( $ 310.00 ) falls outside the ± $ 10/tonne range of the price index 48 hours prior to tender closing an adjustment to the amount paid to the Contractor would be required .
The price would be adjusted using the P > ( T + $ 10/tonne ) formula .
Thus , the Owner will add the following amount to the payment to the Contractor : PA = ( 310 - ( 283.75 + 10 ) ) x 250 = $ 4062.50 Compensation to the Contractor or the Owner for differences between the asphalt binder content as determined by extracted asphalt content , and the assumed asphalt binder content specified in 609.03.03.01 for the total payable tonnage , will be as follows : Payment to the Contractor will be made for asphalt content in excess of the assumed asphalt binder content specified in 609.03.03.01 for the total payable tonnage , subject to the following limitations : The maximum amount of asphalt content used in the above calculation will be the “ Approved Asphalt Binder Content , ” from the JMF and subsequent approved adjustments , plus 0.65 % for Type A/HRA mix and 0.5 % for Type B mix .
Credit shall be given to the Owner for all asphalt binder content below the assumed asphalt binder content for the total payable tonnage .
Payments and credits will be based on the actual price per tonne as bid to the Contractor by the supplier for the Work .
Payments and credits will be determined on a day by day basis .
This determination is independent from and has no relationship to calculations for determining Unit Price adjustments as determined under 609.05.02 .

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY EROSION CONTROL MATS 807 2013.01.15 807-1 807.01 Description The work in this Section consists of the installation of temporary erosion control mats , either jute mat or erosion control blankets , to protect newly seeded soils from erosion caused by overland flows or to provide cover for overwinter protection of late season grading work .
Note that , throughout this Section , the term erosion control mat pertains to both ( a ) jute mat and ( b ) the various types of erosion control blankets .
These mats are for application on steep slopes and stream banks where erosion hazard is high , in newly constructed ditch areas located just upstream of watercourses that are seeded outside of the normal construction period ( refer to Section 803 Hydro seeding ) , in areas where moving water is likely to wash out new vegetation ( e.g. , in grassed waterways , diversion ditches , and drainage ditches ) , and where mulch is applied and wind protection is important .
As well , erosion control material is recommended for the back slope , fore slope and bottom of ditches where the ditch is located within 30 m of a watercourse and the ditch gradient is greater than 5 % .
* Refer to Section 7.1.7 Erosion Control Mats of TIE ’ s Environmental Protection Plan .
807.02 Material Types The selection of erosion control mat type is dependant upon many factors including slope , water flow volume and velocity , the length of time that temporary protection is required , and area sensitivity .
For all erosion control mat types , staples for anchoring the mat shall be U-shaped No .
11 gauge wire or heavier .
Their length shall be 150 mm to 300 mm , with the longer staples used on loose , sandy or unstable soils .
Jute Mat # 1 For low to moderate embankment slopes , and for low flow channels where protection is required for a short period before vegetation is established , Jute Mat is recommended .
# 2 Jute Mat is useful as a cover material for mulched areas .
Jute Mat shall be a cloth of uniform plain weave of undyed and unbleached single jute yarn , 1.22 mm in width plus or minus 25 mm and weighing an average of 600 g/per linear metre with a tolerance of plus or minus 5 % .
The yarn shall be of a loosely twisted construction having an average twist of not less than 1.6 turns per 25 mm and shall not vary in thickness by more than ½ its normal diameter .
Erosion Control Blanket - Straw Blanket For moderate to steep embankment slopes and low flow channels where protection is required for a short period before vegetation is established , a straw blanket is recommended .
Depending on the erosion conditions , the straw blanket will be sewn together by either a single biodegradable net on top or by a straw filter matrix between two biodegradable nets .
Erosion Control Blanket - Straw-Coconut Fibre Blanket For severe embankment slopes and medium flow channels requiring long-term protection before vegetation is established , a straw-coconut fibre blanket is recommended .
This blanket GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY EROSION CONTROL MATS 807 2013.01.15 807-2 shall include ultraviolet stabilized netting and a high quality straw , either single or double matrix , supplemented with coconut fibre or an excelsior blanket of curled wood excelsior of 80 % 150 mm or longer fibre , covered on top with a biodegradable plastic mesh .

This blanket shall include a 100 % coconut filter matrix between two heavy duty , ultra violet stabilized nets or curled wood excelsior blanket of 80 % , 150 mm or longer fibre and with each side covered with black , extra heavy duty extruded plastic mesh netting .
807.03 Construction Method Figures 807-1 and 807-2 correspond to the text in this Section , and are applicable for both jute mat and erosion control blanket installations .
After the site has been shaped and graded to the approved design , the Contractor shall prepare a uniformly even seedbed relatively free from gullies , large roots , rocks greater than 40 mm in diameter , and other debris/obstructions that will prevent uniform contact of the protective covering with the soil surface .
The most critical aspect of installing erosion control mats is obtaining firm , continuous contact between the material and the mulch and/or the soil .
Without good contact , erosion may occur .
The Contractor shall not stretch the mat material but allow it to lay loosely on the soil .
In ditches or channels , the erosion control mat is to be laid out in the direction of flow .
On steep slopes , the mat is to be laid out with its length extending from the top to the bottom of the slope .
The Contractor shall start laying the mat from the top of the ditch or slope and unroll down grade .
Anchor slots : At the up slope end of the site , the Contractor shall construct a 150 mm deep trench and staple the upper edge of the matting into the trench using staple spacing of 300 mm ; then backfill and firmly compact the trench ( i.e. , anchor slot . )
Overlap : Where the erosion control mat lengths are laid side by side on the down slope , the sides will be overlapped by a minimum of 100 mm , and the overlapped materials will be stapled down the centre of the overlap every 450 mm , making sure the mat material is smooth and in firm contact with the soil .
Where mat lengths are installed with no overlap , staple spacing along their outside edges can be 600 mm .
Joining Lengths of Erosion Control Mat : Where two mat lengths must be joined end-to-end , the down slope mat shall be first stapled into an anchor slot trench which shall be backfilled and compacted as outlined above .
Then , the up slope mat shall be laid overtop of the finished anchor slot , overlapping the slot and the exposed down slope mat by 300 mm .
The overlap shall be then stapled at 300 mm spacing on centre .
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY EROSION CONTROL MATS 807 2013.01.15 807-3 Additional Erosion Check Slots : On slopes or ditches more than 30 m long , there should be an erosion check slot installed at 15 m intervals .
Check slots are trenches 100 mm deep by 100 mm wide .
During the mat lay out process , the mat shall be installed in the trench , stapled at 300 mm spacing along the down slope side of the trench , and then the mat will continue to be laid ( on the down slope side of the ditch or slope ) .
The trench shall be backfilled and the soil compacted firmly .
It may be beneficial to determine the need for erosion check slots , and construct the trenches accordingly , before laying the erosion control mat .
All staples are to be flush with the ground and secured as per the manufacturer's specifications .
Additional staples may be required to secure the erosion control mat in depressions .
The Contractor shall make sure that the erosion control mat is well anchored so that it does not slip or wash out .
Any water that may accumulate underneath the fabric must be prevented from moving downward with sufficient velocity to cause erosion .
If a berm or dyke is located at the top of the slope , the Contractor shall extend the erosion control mat over the berm and anchor it behind the berm .
At a point where the erosion control mat is discontinued or where the mat meets a structure , the Contractor shall fold 100 mm of the material underneath and staple at a minimum interval of every 300 mm across the width of the mat .
If the manufacturer ’ s installation requirements are more stringent than those identified above , then the manufacturer ’ s requirements are to be followed .
807.04 Maintenance Inspect regularly and after rainfalls of 5 mm or more accumulation , and repair areas if/as required , until the area has stabilized .
Do not remove sediment control structures until the area has been properly stabilized .
807.05 Method of Measurement The areas covered with the erosion control mat as outlined in Provision 807.03 shall be measured for payment in square metres and no compensation for mat overlap will be considered .
807.06 Basis of Payment Payment under this Section shall be at the unit bid price per square metre for the erosion control mat as specified and this price shall be full compensation for all labour , equipment , material , mats or blankets , staples , maintenance , materials and incidentals necessary to perform the work .
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY SEDIMENT TRAPS 808 2017.02.17 808-1 808.01 Description Work under this Section consists of the construction of a temporary sediment trap/pond , by building an earthen embankment with a stone outlet , to detain silt-laden run-off from small disturbed areas ( generally less than 2 ha ) long enough to allow the majority of sediment to settle .
These sediment traps receive concentrated runoff flows and are commonly installed in newly constructed road ditches at the down gradient point of the ditch work or immediately adjacent to this point of the ditch , to function as a last location for sediment settling prior to release of the runoff water .
* Refer to Section 7.1.2 Sediment Traps of TIE ’ s Environmental Protection Plan .
808.02 Material The random rip rap for the stone outlet shall be Class R-5 in accordance with Section 213 .
The geotechnical fabric shall have the minimum specifications as shown in Table 808-1 .
Table 808-1Requirements for Geotechnical Fabric Property Min .
Non-Woven Tensile Strength ( N ) 690 Tear Strength ( N ) 310 Equivalent Open Size - EOS ( μm ) 50-150 Elongation at Break ( % ) 70-100 808.03 Construction Sediment traps should be an initial installation at a work site , constructed prior to grubbing the site .
Sediment traps should not be located within 20 metres of an inlet or an outlet of a cross road drainage structure .
The sediment trap should be designed to ensure that the ponding behind the structure achieves the purpose of providing adequate opportunity for suspended solids in the runoff water to settle .
The trap length should be at least twice the average width , and the trap depth should be approximately 1 m to provide adequate sediment retention capacity and to lessen the frequency of clean-out .
The trap depth can be increased should a greater retention volume be desired .
The trap shall have earthen embankments ( berms ) that will form an impoundment area .
The area under the embankments shall be cleared , grubbed and stripped of any vegetation or roots before clean , excavated fill is placed and compacted in 150 mm layers .
The embankment side slopes should be no steeper than 1:1 .
The top and outside slopes of the GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION , INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY SEDIMENT TRAPS 808 2017.02.17 808-2 earthen embankments shall be hydro seeded or seeded and covered with jute mat immediately after installation .
Immediately beyond the downstream end of the stone outlet , an apron area shall be excavated to a depth of approximately 300 mm ( below the bottom of impoundment elevation ) to receive the overflow water and to minimize associated erosion .
Following preparation of the impoundment embankments and the apron area , the stone outlet area shall be prepared .
The outlet shall be located at the downstream end of the trap , with its main spillway elevation approximately 300 mm below the top of the impoundment embankments to ensure that discharge occurs through the spillway .
The spillway shall have a minimum width of 600 mm in accordance with Figure 808-1 .
Once the subgrade for the base and side slopes of the outlet as well as the apron are brought to grade , the geotechnical fabric shall be placed on these prepared earthen surfaces .
The edges of the fabric will overlap onto the earthen embankment areas at least 100 mm .
At the upstream side of the outlet , the fabric shall be securely toed-in to the earthen base of the impoundment .
At the downstream side of the outlet , the fabric shall extend into the apron area and be securely toed-in to its earthen base material .
The riprap for the spillway core will then be placed on the fabric , being careful not to damage the fabric .
The top of the spillway shall be 300 mm lower than the adjacent embankments , and the spillway core will extend across the full width of the outlet .
The core riprap then needs to be wrapped with geotechnical fabric .
At the upstream side of the outlet , the fabric shall again extend down to the impoundment base and be securely toed-in to the earthen base of the impoundment .
This will avoid undermining at the upstream side of the outlet .
The fabric will wrap overtop of the spillway riprap core , down the downstream side of the core , and will extend into the apron and be securely toed-in to its earthen base material .
This fabric will extend at least as far into the apron as the previously installed fabric so that runoff flows overtop of the fabric and undermining of the apron is avoided .
Finally , place remaining riprap on the side slopes of the outlet and on the downstream side of the spillway ( covering the fabric in these locations ) , and in the apron area ( including overtop of the fabric in the apron ) .
808.04 Maintenance The Contractor shall inspect regularly and after rainfalls of 5 mm or more accumulation and repair any damaged areas .
Sediment shall be removed and the trap restored to its original dimensions when the trap is b full of sediment in accordance with Section 810 .

PREVENTION OF THE TRANSPORTATION / INTRODUCTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES 1 .
Environmental Concerns Waters of Atlantic Canada are experiencing the effects of invasive aquatic plant and animal species from around the world .
Once these non-native or invasive species have established themselves in a new ecosystem ( absent of their natural predators ) they can harm native species , possibly causing entire ecosystems to be disrupted due to habitat destruction or food chain alteration ( i.e .
preying on native species , transmitting disease , etc . ) .
2012.02.09 A2-7 The principal invasive species in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Canadian Atlantic coast are Tunicates ( Styela clava ) , Green Crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and Green Alga 's ( i.e .
Oyster Thief ( Codium fragile tomentosoides ) ) .
Up to date information on the present distribution of these species in the Northumberland Strait can be obtained by calling the Habitat Management Branch of Fisheries and Oceans Canada at ( 902 ) 863-5670 .
Information on the Gulf of St. Lawrence can also be found at www.glf.dfo-mpo.gc.ca and for the Canadian Atlantic coasts at www.northeastANS.org .
2 .
Pathways Non-native and invasive species may be unintentionally introduced into a marine environment via various marine construction and improvement projects .
These species have the potential to alter the native ecosystems and have negative impacts on the commercial fishing and aquaculture industries .
Potential pathways for spreading these species include , but are not limited to , the following : < Species or their water borne larva travelling in bilge and ballast water of various marine construction equipment ( i.e. , barges , scows , etc . ) .
< Marine sediments remaining in excavation equipment , barges or trucks .
< Species being attached to or carried in the bottom/hull of various boats or barges .
3 .
Environmental Protection Procedures The following protection procedures are intended to reduce the potential risk of transporting and introducing invasive marine/terrestrial species : < All dredging equipment including excavators/cranes , floating plant , scows , barges and work boats are to be free of all marine growth prior to mobilization to the site .
< The Contractor will make all equipment available for inspection by regulatory authorities ( i.e .
Provincial Environment Department , Federal Department of Environment and the Habitat Management Branch of Fisheries and Oceans Canada , or other agencies ) if requested .
Any growth identified is to be completely removed from the equipment in an environmentally acceptable manner and using methods approved by the regulatory authority .
< The Contractor is to coordinate removal and cleaning operations to ensure they abide by all requirements of the Provincial Environment Department , Federal Department of Environment , the Habitat Management Branch of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and any other applicable agencies .
< The Contractor shall ensure that all costs associated with the requirements of this section are included in the bid price .
4 .
The Contractor is required to : < Be familiar with Invasive Species Management Plans , Codes of Practice , or other documents that relate to the control and spread of aquatic invasive species , and acquire any special regulatory permits or approvals associated 2012.02.09 A2-8 with the use of their equipment in or near a marine environment , other than the typical permits and approvals acquired by the Department or proponent to conduct the work .
< Produce independent documentation ( eg .
Divers inspection reports and video of inspection , etc .
of boats , barges or scows ) as to when and how they had conducted the above mentioned mitigation measures , at the request of the Department or a regulatory agency , at any time .
5 .
