103.10—Assignments , Transfers , or Assumptions of the Contract The Contractor shall not assign , transfer , convey , or allow any person or business to assume or take over , in whole or in part , the Contract , the Contractor ’ s duties , or performance obligations , arising under , from or relating to the Contract , except for subcontracting as provided in Section 105.06 or the rights of a surety issuing a performance bond for the Contract , without the Engineer ’ s speciﬁc written autho- rization .
Any such unauthorized assignment , transfer , conveyance , assumption , or take over agreement shall be void and shall constitute a material breach of the Contract .
No assignment , transfer , conveyance , assumption , or take over agreement shall relieve the Contractor from its duties and obligations under the Contract , or release the Contractor of any liability under the Contract bonds .
SECTION 104—SCOPE OF WORK 104.01—Intent of Contract The intent of the Contract is to provide for completion of the Work speciﬁed therein in accordance with the Contract for the Contract amount and within the Contract time limit .
Further , it is understood that the Contractor shall perform the Work under the Contract as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Department , the Commissioner or the Board .
104.02—Changes in Quantities or Alterations in the Work ( a ) General The Engineer reserves the right to make , in writing , at any time during the Work , such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to complete the project satisfactorily .
Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the Contract or release the surety , and the Contractor shall agree to perform the Work as altered .
No change alteration or modiﬁcation in or deviations from the Contract , or the giving by the Department of any extension of time for the performance of the Contract , or the forbearance on the part of the Department shall release or exon- erate in whole or in part either the Contractor or any surety on the obligations of any bond given in connection with the Contract .
Neither the Department nor the Contractor shall be under any obliga- tion to notify the surety or sureties of any such alteration , change , extension or forbearance , notice thereof being expressly waived .
Any increase in the Contract amount shall automatically result in a corresponding increase in the penal amount of the bonds without notice to or consent from the surety , such notice and consent being hereby waived .
Decreases in the Contract amount shall not , however , reduce the penal amount of the bonds unless speciﬁcally provided in any change order as authorized in accordance with Section 109.05 decreasing the scope of the work .
32 ( b ) Signiﬁcant Changes in the Character of Work The work or changes in quantities , signiﬁcantly change the character of the work under the Contract , an adjustment , excluding anticipated proﬁts for reduced or eliminated work , may be made to the Contract .
The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the affected Work .
If a basis can not be agreed upon , an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable .
The Engineer may , at his option , direct the Contractor to accomplish the change or alteration on a force account basis when the circumstances meet the requirements for force account work under Section 109.05 .
If the Engineer ’ s changes or alterations do not result in a signiﬁcant change in the character of the Work , the changed or altered work will be paid for at the Contract price for the actual quantities of work performed .
The term signiﬁcant change shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances : 1 .
When the character of the Work , as changed or altered , differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction .
2 .
When the actual quantity of a Major Item of work , as deﬁned elsewhere in the Contract , increases or decreases more than 25 percent of the original Contract quantity .
Any adjust- ment for an increase or decrease in cost due to an increase in quantity of more than 25 percent shall be calculated only on that quantity in excess of 125 percent of the original pay item quantity .
Any adjustment for an increase or decrease in cost due to a decrease in quantity to less than 75 percent of the original pay item quantity shall apply to the actual amount of work performed .
3 .
When the actual quantity of piling increases or decreases more than 25 percent of the original pay item quantity , whether or not such item has been designated as a Major Item .
Compensation for such increases or decreases shall be the same as for a Major Item of work .
4 .
When the actual quantity of a Minor Item of work , as deﬁned elsewhere in the Contract , increases more than 200 percent of the original pay item quantity and the amount paid for such item can be demonstrated as not representative of the true cost of the work when considering the applicable unit price .
( c ) Value Engineering Proposals The Contractor may submit to the Engineer written Value Engineering Contractor Proposals ( VECP ) for modifying the plans , Speciﬁcations , or other Contract requirements for the pur- pose of reducing the total cost and/or Contract time without reducing the design capacity or quality of the ﬁnished product .
If the Department accepts the VECP , the Department and the Contractor will equally divide the net savings or Contract time , or both .
When an accepted VECP includes Contract time savings , one-half of such time savings shall be used to reduce the Contract time and the remaining one-half of such time savings shall be used exclusively by the Contractor as extra time .
The Contractor shall identify in the SOR , a VECP contractor ﬂoat activity for each accepted VECP that includes Contract time savings .
The VECP extra time may be used by the Contractor to mitigate its delays on the project .
104.02 33 Each VECP shall result in a net savings over the Contract cost or Contract time , or both , with- out impairing essential functions and characteristics of the item ( s ) or of any other part of the project , including , but not limited to , service life , reliability , economy of operation , ease of maintenance , aesthetics , and safety .
At least the following information shall be submitted with each VECP : • Statement that the proposal is submitted as a VECP .
• Statement concerning the basis for the VECP beneﬁts to the Department and an itemization of the pay items and requirements affected by the VECP .
• Detailed estimate of the cost or Contract time , or both , under the existing Contract and under the VECP .
• Proposed speciﬁcations and recommendations as to the manner in which the VECP changes are to be accomplished .
• Statement as to the time by which a Contract change order adopting the VECP must be issued so as to obtain the maximum cost-effectiveness .
The Department will process the VECP in the same manner as prescribed for any other pro- posal that would necessitate issuance of a change order .
The Department may accept a VECP in whole or part by issuing a change order that will identify the VECP on which it is based .
The Department will not be liable to the Contractor for failure to accept or act on any VECP submitted pursuant to these requirements or for delays in the work attributable to any VECP .
Until a VECP is put into effect by a change order , the Contractor shall remain obligated to the terms and conditions of the existing Contract .
If an executed change order has not been issued by the date on which the Contractor ’ s proposal speciﬁes that a decision should be made or such other date as the Contractor may subsequently have speciﬁed in writing , the VECP shall be deemed rejected .
The change order effecting the necessary modiﬁcation of the Contract will establish the net savings agreed on , and provide for adjustment of the Contract prices or Contract time , or both .
The Contractor shall absorb all costs incurred in preparing a VECP .
Costs for reviewing and administering a VECP will be borne by the Department .
The Department may include in the agreement any conditions it deems appropriate for consideration , approval , and implemen- tation of the VECP .
The Contractor ’ s 50 percent share of the net savings or Contract time , or both , shall constitute full compensation to him for effecting all changes pursuant to the VECP change order .
Unless speciﬁcally provided for in the change order authorizing the VECP , acceptance of the VECP and performance of the work thereunder will not change the Contract time limit .
The Department may adopt a VECP for general use in contracts the Department administers if it determines that the VECP is suitable for application to other contracts .
VECPs identical with or similar to previously submitted VECPs will be eligible for consideration and compensation under these provisions if the Department has not previously adopted the VECPs for general application to other contracts the Department administers .
When a VECP is adopted for gen- eral use , compensation pursuant to these requirements will be applied only to those awarded contracts for which the VECP was submitted prior to the date of adoption of the VECP .
104.02 34 Proposed changes in the basic design of a bridge or pavement type or those changes that require different right of way limits will not normally be considered an acceptable VECP .
If a VECP is based on or is similar to a change in the plans , Speciﬁcations , or Special Provisions the Depart- ment has adopted prior to submission of the VECP , the Engineer will not accept the VECP .
The Engineer will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a VECP .
The requirements herein apply to each VECP initiated , developed , and identiﬁed as such by the Contractor at the time of its submission to the Engineer .
However , nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Engineer to approve a VECP .
Subject to the provisions herein , the Department or any other public agency shall have the right to use all or part of an accepted VECP without obligation or compensation of any kind to the Contractor .
If the Department accepts a VECP , Section 104.02 ( b ) herein , which pertains to the adjustment of Contract unit prices attributable to alterations of Contract quantities , will not apply to the items adjusted or deleted as a result of putting the VECP into effect by a change order .
104.03—Differing Site Conditions Type I : During the progress of the Work , if subsurface or latent physical conditions differing materially from those indicated in the Contract are encountered at the site , the Contractor shall promptly notify the Engineer in writing of the speciﬁc differing conditions before the site is disturbed further and before the affected work is performed .
Type II : During the progress of the Work , if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature , differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the Contract , are encountered at the site the Contractor shall promptly notify the Engineer in writ- ing of the speciﬁc differing conditions before the site is disturbed further and before the affected work is performed .
Upon receipt of such written notiﬁcation , the Engineer will acknowledge receipt and investigate the con- ditions .
If it is determined by the Engineer that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the Contract , an adjustment , excluding anticipated proﬁts , will be made and the Contract may be modiﬁed in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
No adjustment that results in a beneﬁt to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
SECTION 105—CONTROL OF WORK 105.01—Notice to Proceed Unless otherwise indicated in the Contract , the Notice to Proceed date will be the date selected by the Contractor on which the Contractor intends to begin the work .
That date shall be no earlier than 104.02 35 15 nor later than 30 calendar days after the date of Contract execution .
The State Contract Engineer will contact the Contractor on the date of Contract execution to inform him that the Contract has been executed .
The State Contract Engineer will also conﬁrm this date in the Letter of Contract Execution .
Copies of the Letter of Contract Execution will be distributed to Department personnel involved in the administration of the Contract and to the Contractor .
Within 10 calendar days after the date of Contract execution the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer written notice of the date he has selected as his Notice to Proceed date .
If the Contractor fails to provide written notice of his selected Notice to Proceed Date within 10 calendar days of Contract execution , the selected Notice to Proceed Date will become the date 15 calendar days after the date of Contract execution .
The Contractor shall begin work no later than 10 calendar days after the date he has selected as his Notice to Proceed date , unless the Notice to Proceed date is otherwise indicated in the Contract , in which case the Contractor shall begin work within 10 calendar days after the speciﬁc Notice to Proceed date indicated in the Contract .
Contract Time will commence on the date of the Notice to Proceed .
The Letter of Contract Execution will identify the Chief Engineer ’ s authorized representative , hereafter referred to as the Engineer , who is responsible for written directives and changes to the Contract .
The Engineer will contact the Contractor after notice of award to arrange a pre-construction conference .
In the event the Contractor , for matters of his convenience , wishes to begin work earlier than 15 calendar days or later than 30 calendar days after the date of Contract execution , he shall make such a request in writing to the Engineer within 10 calendar days of the date of Contract execution or once a Notice to Proceed Date has been established , if he wishes to begin work more than 10 calendar days after his selected Notice to Proceed date or the Notice to Proceed Date indicated in the Contract , he shall make such a request to the Engineer in writing no later than 5 calendar days after the Notice to Proceed date .
If this requested start date is acceptable to the Department , the Contractor will be notified in writing ; however , the Contract Completion Date will not be adjust- ed but will remain binding .
The Contractor ’ s request to adjust the start date for the work on the Contract will not be considered as a basis for claim that the time resulting from the Contractor ’ s adjusted start date , if accepted by the Engineer , is insufficient to accomplish the work nor shall it relieve the Contractor of his responsibility to perform the work in accordance with the scope of work and Contract requirements .
In no case shall work begin before the Department executes the Contract or prior to the Notice to Proceed date unless otherwise permitted by the Contract or authorized by the Engineer .
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer at least 24 hours prior to the date on which he will begin the work .
105.02—Pre-Construction Conference After notiﬁcation of award and prior to the Notice to Proceed date the Contractor shall attend a pre- construction conference scheduled by the Engineer to discuss the Contractor ’ s planned operations for prosecuting and completing the Work in accordance with the Contract .
At the pre-construction conference the Engineer and the Contractor will identify in writing the authorities and responsibilities of project personnel for each party .
The Contractor and the Department shall also come prepared to discuss key issues and project speciﬁc requirements necessary for preparation and submittal of the baseline progress schedule ; unless a separate Scheduling Conference is otherwise scheduled as mutually agreed to by the Engineer and the Contractor , in accordance with Section 108.03 and other applicable Contract provisions .
The Engineer will be responsible for setting the conference agenda , conducting discussions , and ensuring that minutes of the conference are taken and later timely distributed to all attendees .
The pre-construc- tion conference will be the time to review the Contract plans and documents .
To that end , the conference 105.02 36 105.02 agenda may include but not be limited to discussions on the general sequence of work , including the ex- pected primary work tasks as deﬁned by the Contractor , and proposed means and methods for the entire scope of work , potential problems or impacts , constructability issues , special considerations such as lim- itations and access issues , agreements with local agencies or governments , utility impacts or relocations including railroads , coordination with schedules of the utilities and subcontractors and associated work , sources and delivery of critical materials , submittals required by Contract including shop drawings , loca- tion of ﬁeld ofﬁce , labs , etc. , environmental concerns including permits and erosion and siltation efforts , maintenance of trafﬁc issues , and EEO\DBE\SWaM requirements .
The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a list of all equipment available for use in the prosecution of the Work on the Contract at the pre-construction conference or no later than one week prior to the ﬁrst monthly progress estimate .
The make , model , size , capacity , and year of manufacture shall be listed for each piece of equipment .
Where possible the Contractor shall provide this list in an electronic format .
This list may take the form of the Contractor ’ s ﬂeet list of equipment .
The Contractor shall provide the Engineer an updated list of equipment as changes occur .
105.03—Authorities of Project Personnel , Communication and Decision Making ( a ) Authority of Engineer During prosecution of the Work , the Engineer will answer all questions that may arise as to the quantity , quality , and acceptability of materials furnished and work performed ; rate of progress of the Work ; interpretation of the plans and Speciﬁcations ; the Contractor ’ s acceptable fulﬁll- ment of the Contract ; disputes and mutual rights between contractors ; and the Contractor ’ s compensation .
The Engineer has the authority to suspend the Work wholly or in part if the Contractor has created conditions that are unsafe or fails to correct conditions that are unsafe for workers or the general public or fails to carry out the provisions of the Contract .
The Engineer may also suspend the Work for such periods as he may deem necessary because of catastrophic or extraordinary weather as deﬁned in Section 108.04 , conditions considered unsuitable for prosecution of the Work , or any other condition or reason deemed to be in the public interest .
The Engineer may issue written clariﬁcations or directives that either enhance or alter the Con- tract .
The Engineer may issue written orders for such work as may be necessary to complete the Contract satisfactorily .
( b ) Authority of Inspector Inspectors representing the Department are authorized to inspect all work performed and ma- terials furnished .
Inspection may extend to all or any part of the Work and to the preparation , fabrication , and manufacture of the materials to be used .
The Inspectors are not authorized to alter or waive the provisions of these Speciﬁcations or make changes in the plans .
The Inspectors are not authorized to make ﬁnal acceptance of the project , approve any opera- tion or item , or act as foreman for the Contractor .
However , the Inspectors will have the author- ity to reject defective work and material and suspend work that is being improperly performed , subject to the concurrence of the Engineer .
Such inspections shall not relieve the Contractor of any obligation to furnish acceptable materials or provide completed construction that is in accordance with the Contracts requirements .
37 105.03 The Inspectors will exercise only such additional authority as the Engineer may delegate .
The Engineer will advise the Contractor in writing of delegations of authority that will affect his operations .
( c ) The Contractor The Contractor shall not construe reviews , approvals , or inspections by the Department , the Engineer , or the Department ’ s inspectors , agents , and employees as a waiver , release , war- ranty , or assumption of liability on the part of the Department .
The Contractor understands and agrees that reviews , approvals , and inspections are for the Department ’ s sole use and beneﬁt .
Any such reviews , approvals , and inspections shall not relieve the Contractor of its contractual duties and obligations or be conclusive as to the acceptability of the Contractor ’ s performance .

Inspections shall include all areas of the site disturbed by construction activity , all on-site support facilities and all off site support facilities within VDOT right of way or easement .
Inspections shall be conducted at least once every 7 calendar days ( equivalent to once every 5 business days ) and within 48 hours following any mea- sureable storm event .
In the event a measureable storm event occurs when there are more than 48 hours between business days , the inspection shall occur no later than the next business day .
A business day is deﬁned as Monday through Friday excluding State holidays .
A measurable storm event is deﬁned as one producing 0.25 inches of rainfall or greater over a 24 hour time period .
The Contractor shall install a rain gage at a central location on the project site for the purposes of determining the occur- rence of a measureable storm event .
Where the project is of such a length that one rain gage may not provide an accurate representation of a the occurrence of a mea- surable storm event over the entire project site , the Contractor shall install as many rain gages as necessary to accurately reﬂect the amount of rainfall received over all portions of the project .
The rain gage shall be observed no less than once each busi- ness day at the time prescribed in the SWPPP General Information Sheet notes in the construction plans or other Contract documents to determine if a measureable storm event has occurred .
The procedures for determining the occurrence of a measurable storm event are identiﬁed in the SWPPP General Information Sheet notes in the construction plans or other Contract documents .
For those areas of the site that have been temporarily stabilized or where land disturbing activities have been suspended due to continuous frozen ground conditions and stormwater discharges are unlike- ly , the inspection schedule may be reduced to once per month .
If weather condi- tions ( such as above freezing temperatures or rain or snow events ) make stormwater discharges likely , the Contractor shall immediately resume the regular inspection schedule .
Those deﬁnable areas where ﬁnal stabilization has been achieved will not require further inspections provided such areas have been identiﬁed in the project ’ s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan .
b. Corrective Actions If a site inspection identiﬁes an existing control measure that is not being maintained properly or operating effectively ; an existing control measure that needs to be mod- iﬁed ; locations where an additional control measure is necessary ; or any other deﬁ- ciencies in the erosion and sediment control and pollution prevention plan , correc- tive action ( s ) shall be completed as soon as practical and prior to the next anticipated measurable storm event but no later than 7 days after the date of the site inspection that identiﬁed the deﬁciency .

108.03—Progress Schedule Unless otherwise indicated in the Contract , the Contractor shall , at a minimum , be governed by the following : 108.03 116 ( a ) General Requirements The Contractor shall plan and schedule the work and shall submit his overall work plan in the form of a written Progress Schedule , as described herein , for the Engineer ’ s review and acceptance .
The accepted Progress Schedule will be used by the Engineer for planning and coordination of the Department activities , resources , and expenditures , and for evaluation of the Contractor ’ s rate of progress and the effects of time-related impacts on the project .
When preparing the Progress Schedule , the Contractor shall consider all known constraints and restrictions such as holidays , seasonal , weather , trafﬁc , utility , railroad , right-of-way , environ- mental , permits , or other known or speciﬁed limitations to the work .
At the Pre-Construction Conference the Contractor shall be prepared to discuss his planned or contemplated operations relative to the Contract requirements .
Delays resulting from the Contractor ’ s failure to provide the Progress Schedule will not be considered just cause for extension of the Contract time limit or for additional compensation .
( b ) Progress Schedule Submission Requirements The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer three ( 3 ) copies of the written Baseline Progress Schedule at least 7 calendar days prior to beginning work .
The Progress Schedule shall repre- sent the Contractor ’ s overall work plan to accomplish the entire scope of work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract .
The Progress Schedule shall include all work including , as applicable , the work to be performed by sub-contractors , the Department , or others .
The Progress Schedule submittal shall consist of a written Narrative to : • Describe the Contractor ’ s proposed general sequence to accomplish the work ; • Indicate the general schedule of work to be completed each month in terms of the major operations , routes , or segments of work as delineated in the Contract or in the absence of such delineations , as agreed to by the Contractor and the Engineer .
A bar-chart schedule may be substituted at the Contractor ’ s option .
The Progress Schedule , including the Initial and any subsequent Revised Progress Sched- ules requested by the Engineer or originated by the Contractor , will not be measured or paid for separately .
All associated costs to prepare , update , revise , and/or furnish the Prog- ress Schedule in accordance with the requirements herein shall be considered incidental to the work .
1 .
Two Week Look-ahead ( TWLA ) Progress Schedule .
At least 7 calendar days prior to beginning work , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer , an initial written TWLA Progress Schedule for any work planned for the ﬁrst two weeks .
Every week thereafter , on a day agreed to by the Contractor and the Engineer , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer , a written TWLA Progress Schedule for the following two-week period .
The TWLA schedule shall provide a detailed list of operations to indicate the type of oper- ation , locations of the work , proposed working days and hours , and the start and ﬁnish dates for any work planned , started , in progress , or scheduled for completion during the two-week period .
The TWLA Progress Schedule shall also indicate any critical stages of work requiring VDOT oversight or inspection .
The Contractor shall submit 3 copies of the TWLA Progress Schedule to the Engineer in any legible format .
108.03 117 The Contractor may revise his TWLA Progress Schedule at his discretion .
However , the Contractor shall notify the Engineer at least 48 working hours in advance of any changes in the Contractor ’ s planned operations or critical stage work requiring De- partment oversight or inspection .
In the event of extenuating circumstances deemed by the Engineer to be beyond the Contractor ’ s control , the Engineer may grant verbal concurrence of changes in the Contractor ’ s planned operations with less advance notice , as the need arises .
2 .
Progress Schedule Revisions .
The Contractor may revise his overall plan of operations at any time ; however , the Contractor shall submit a Revised Progress Schedule to reﬂect any changes in his overall sequence of operations or general schedule .
The Contractor may be required , as determined by the Engineer , to submit a Revised Progress Schedule .
Circumstances that may prompt the Engineer ’ s decision to request a Revised Progress Schedule may include deviations from the overall sequence of operations or if the actu- al progress of work varies by one month or more from the currently accepted Progress Schedule .
When required by the Engineer , the Revised Progress Schedule shall be submitted within 7 calendar days of receipt of the Engineer ’ s written request .
The Revised Progress Schedule shall be submitted in the form of the Progress Schedule as deﬁned herein , to reﬂect the changes in the Contractor ’ s overall work plan .
The accepted Revised Progress Schedule will replace any previously accepted Progress Schedule for the remainder of the work .
( c ) Submittal and Reporting Format If requested by the Engineer , the Contractor shall submit its progress schedule in the following manner .
1 .
A transmittal letter to the Engineer listing the items , date , and number of copies of items being submitted .
2 .
Three printed legible paper copies of the progress schedule and progress schedule narrative .
3 .
One compact disk ( CD ) containing electronic “ PDF ” copies of the progress schedule , progress schedule narrative , and an electronic back-up ﬁle copy of the working prog- ress schedule .
Each electronic ﬁle submittal shall have a unique ﬁle name indicating the Contract ID , submission number , submittal type , and data date of the submission ( e.g .
C00012345C01_B01_Narrative_6-04-12.pdf ) .
( d ) Engineer ’ s Review and Acceptance The Engineer will review the Baseline or subsequent Revised Progress Schedule submittals for acceptance within 7 calendar days of receipt of the Contractor ’ s complete submittal .
Review and acceptance by the Engineer will be based on conformance with the requirements of this provision and the Contract .
Review and acceptance by the Engineer will not constitute a waiver of any Contract require- ments and will in no way assign responsibilities of the work plan , scheduling assumptions , and validity of the work plan or schedule to the Department .
Failure of the Contractor to include in the Progress Schedule any element of work required by the Contract for timely completion of the Contract shall not excuse the Contractor from his contractual obligations .
108.03 118 ( e ) Failure to Comply with Progress Schedule Submission Requirements With the exception of project start-up activities approved in writing by the Engineer , the Contractor shall not commence work , until 7 days after the date the Contractor submits a complete Baseline Progress Schedule , unless otherwise approved by the Engineer in writing .
If the Contractor fails to comply with any of the Progress Schedule submissions within the time and in the manner speciﬁed , the Engineer may withhold approval of the Contractor ’ s ensuing monthly progress estimates until the Contractor has satisﬁed the submission requirements .
If the Contractor fails to submit the Final As-Built Schedule in the time and manner required , the Engineer may withhold approval of the ﬁnal payment until the Contractor satisﬁes the submis- sion requirement .
The Department shall not be responsible for any delays , costs or damages resulting from the Contractor ’ s failure to submit the schedule submittals in accordance with the requirements of the Contract .
108.04—Determination and Extension of Completion Date The Department will specify the Completion Date in the Contract .
The Department will not consider any request for an extension of time that is based on a claim that the Completion Date as originally estab- lished is insufﬁcient to complete the Work .
When Contract execution is not within 60 calendar days after the opening of bids , or when the Contractor is unable to commence work because of any failure of the Department , the Contractor will be given an extension of time based on the number of days delayed beyond the 60 calendar days .
No time extension will be allowed for a delay in the date of Contract execution when the delay is the fault of the Contractor .
The Engineer will determine if an extension of the Contract time limit for completion is warranted by additions to the Contract .
The Contractor shall inform the Department , in writing , of a request for time extensions in his Work Order in accordance with the applicable portion ( s ) of Section 104 or 109 .
The Contractor shall provide written supporting data for any request for extension of time due to quantity additions and or additional or altered work .
During prosecution of the work , the Contractor shall identify the causes for any delays attributable to conditions he deems to be beyond his control and shall identify the particular construction operations affected , their criticality to project milestones or overall Contract completion , and the signiﬁcant dates that encompass the periods of delay .
The Contractor shall furnish all such information necessary for the Department to make an adequate evaluation of any request received from the Contractor for an extension of the Contract time limit within 3 days of experiencing such a delay .
( a ) Fixed Date : Unless otherwise indicated in the Contract , the Contract time limit will be speciﬁed as a ﬁxed date for completion .
The Contractor shall take into consideration normal conditions considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the work , and shall place sufﬁcient workers and equipment on the project to complete the work in accordance with the speciﬁed Contract time limit .
If the Contract identiﬁes a contract-speciﬁc Notice to Proceed date and the Contract is not exe- cuted by that date , the Contractor will receive an extension of time equal to the number of days between the contract-speciﬁc Notice to Proceed date and the eventual date of Contract execution .
108.03 119 If the Notice to Proceed date is selected by the Contractor and after prior approval the Engineer directs the Contractor not to begin work on that date , the Contractor will receive an extension of time equal to the number of days between the Contractor ’ s selected Notice to Proceed date and the eventual date the Engineer informs the Contractor that he may commence the work .
The Engineer may give consideration for extension of time when a delay occurs due to unfore- seen causes beyond the control of or without the fault or negligence of the Contractor .
However , consideration will not be given to extensions of time attributable to normal adverse weather conditions or conditions resulting from normal adverse weather .
For the purposes of this Section normal adverse weather is deﬁned as that which is not considered extraordinary or catastrophic and is not reasonably conducive to the Contractor progressively prosecuting critical path work under the Contract .
Weather events considered extraordinary or catastrophic include , but are not limited to tornados , hurricanes , earth- quakes , and ﬂoods that exceed a 25-year storm event as deﬁned by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) for the NOAA data gathering location that is nearest the project site .
If there is a delay in the progress of the work due to unforeseen causes described within these Speciﬁcations , and the delay extends the Contract time limit into the period between November 30 of one year and April 1 of the following year and working conditions during such period are unsuitable for the continuous prosecution or completion of the work , then consideration may only be given to granting an extension of time that will encompass a suitable period during which such work can be expeditiously and acceptably performed .
108.05—Suspension of Work Ordered by the Engineer ( a ) If the Engineer orders the Contractor in writing to suspend performance of all or any portion of the Work for an unreasonable period of time ( not originally anticipated , customary , or inher- ent to the construction industry ) and the Contractor believes that additional compensation or Contract time is due as a result of such suspension , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a written request for adjustment according to Section 108.04 within 7 days after receipt of the notice to resume work .
The Contractor ’ s request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment .
( b ) Upon receipt , the Engineer will review the Contractor ’ s documentation and evaluate the Contractor ’ s request .
If the Engineer agrees that the cost or time required for the performance of the Contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor , his suppliers , or sub- contractors at any tier , and was not caused by weather , the Engineer will make an adjustment ( excluding proﬁt and consequential damages ) and modify the Contract in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination regarding whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
( c ) No Contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time and in the manner prescribed .
( d ) No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this Section to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause , or for which an adjustment is pro- vided for or excluded under any other term or condition of the Contract .
108.05 120 108.06—Failure to Complete on Time ( a ) General For each calendar day that any work remains incomplete after the Contract time limit speciﬁed for the completion of the work , the Department will assess liquidated damages against the Contractor .
Liquidated damages will be assessed at the rate applicable to the Contract in ac- cordance with the Schedule of Liquidated Damages , Table I-1 , or as otherwise speciﬁed in the Contract provisions .
Liquidated damages will be deducted from any monies due the Contractor for each calendar day of additional time consumed until ﬁnal completion and acceptance of the Work , subject to such adjustments as provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 108.04 , not as a penalty , but as liquidated damages .
The Contractor waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in the Contract or these Speciﬁcations and as- sessed by the Department against the Contractor on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual damages .
( b ) Liquidated Damages The following Schedule of Liquidated Damages , representing the cost of administration , engi- neering , supervision , inspection and other expenses , will be charged against the Contractor for each calendar day beyond the Contract time limit that the Contract remains in an incomplete state : Schedule of Liquidated Damages Original Contract Amount in Dollars Daily Charge in Dollars 0.00 - 500,000.00 350 500,000.01 - 2,000,000.00 600 2,000,000.01 - 8,000,000.00 1,350 8,000,000.01 - 15,000,000.00 2,500 15,000,000.01 or more 3,100 TABLE I-1 108.07—Default of Contract The Contractor may be declared in default if he does any one of the following : ( a ) fails to begin the Work within 10 days after the notice to proceed date , except as otherwise permitted by speciﬁc Contract language , or the provisions of Section 105.01 or Section 108.02 ; ( b ) fails to perform the Work with sufﬁcient workers and equipment or with sufﬁcient materials to ensure prompt completion of the Work ; ( c ) performs the Work in such manner that it is unacceptable , or fails , neglects or refuses to promptly remove and replace materials or work that are unacceptable ; ( d ) discontinues prosecution of the Work without an order to do so from the Engineer ; ( e ) fails to resume work that has been discontinued within a reasonable time after notice to do so ; ( f ) becomes insolvent , is declared bankrupt , or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency ; 108.06 121 ( g ) allows any ﬁnal judgment to stand against him unsatisﬁed for a period of 10 days ; ( h ) makes an assignment for the beneﬁt of creditors ; ( i ) fails for any other cause whatsoever to carry on the work in accordance with the Contract or to perform contractual obligations in an acceptable manner ; ( j ) disregards laws , regulations , ordinances , the Engineer ’ s written instructions , or otherwise remains in substantial violation of any provision of the Contract .
If any of these conditions exists , the Engineer will give notice in writing to the Contractor and his surety of the delay , neglect , or default .
If within 10 days after the date of such notice the Contractor or his surety has not taken measures that will , in the judgment of the Engineer , ensure satisfactory progress of the work or give assurances satisfactory to the Engineer that the provisions of the Contract will be fully carried out and instructions complied with , the Commissioner may then , or at any time thereafter , declare the Contractor in default .
Without violating the Contract , the Commissioner may call upon the Contractor ’ s surety for the satisfactory and expeditious completion of all work under the Contract , the removal and replacement of any unacceptable or unauthorized work , or may otherwise terminate the Contract in accordance with the provisions of Section 108.08 .
If the Commissioner de- clares the Contractor in default , payments to the Contractor will be withheld and may be made directly to the Contractor ’ s surety .
Further negotiations regarding the remaining work will be conducted with the Contractor ’ s surety .
If the Contractor ’ s surety fails or refuses to proceed in accordance with the Commissioner ’ s instructions , the Commissioner will appropriate and use any or all materials and equipment on the project site that are suitable and acceptable and will enter into an agreement with others for the completion of the work , or he will use such other methods as he deems necessary to ensure the completion of the work .
Costs and charges incurred by the Department , including the cost of completing the Work under the Con- tractor the cost of removal and replacement of any unacceptable or unauthorized work , will be deducted from any monies due or that will become due the Contractor and his surety .
If the expense incurred by the Department is less than the sum that would have been payable under the Contract had the work been completed by the Contractor , the Contractor and his surety will be entitled to receive the difference .
If the expenses exceed the sum that would have been payable under the Contract , the Contractor and his surety shall be liable for and shall pay to the Commonwealth the amount of the excess .

2 .
Payment : Within 30 days after the Contractor receives the Department ’ s notice of termin- ation for convenience , or within such time as the Contractor and the Engineer mutually agree , the Contractor shall submit a request for payment due for work performed through the effective date of termination and as a result of the termination for convenience .
The Contractor shall submit with the request sufﬁcient cost records to substantiate the payment amount requested .
The Department shall pay and the Contractor shall accept , as full payment for all work and materials provided , a sum mutually agreed to by the Contractor and the Department determined as follows : 108.08 123 a .
Work on Contract pay items performed prior to termination for which the Contractor has not been paid will be paid at the Contract price according to Section 109.03 , or in the absence of Contract unit prices , in accordance with the requirements of Section 109.05 ( Extra and Force Account Work ) .
Items eliminated entirely by termination will be paid for as provided in Section 109.07 .
No claim for loss of anticipated proﬁts will be considered , and the provisions of Section 104.02 will not apply for costs that are then incurred as a result of the termination .
b .
Reimbursement for organizing the Work when not speciﬁed in the Contract and moving equipment to and from the project site will be considered where the volume of work completed is too small to compensate the Contractor for these expenses under the Contract unit prices .
c. At the option of the Engineer , materials the Contractor obtains for the Work that have been inspected , tested , and accepted by the Engineer and that have not been incorpo- rated in the Work may be purchased from the Contractor at actual costs as shown by receipted bills , purchase orders , bills of lading , paid invoices , or other similar actual cost records at such points of delivery as will be designated by the Engineer .
d. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for any actual costs incurred to terminate sub contracts or purchase orders , as shown by receipted bills , bills of lading , paid invoic- es , or other similar actual cost records at such points of delivery as will be designated by the Engineer .

Upon such termination becoming effective , the Department shall provide written notice to the surety conﬁrming that the Contract is terminated , and that the Department is pro- ceeding to ﬁnish the Work as set forth in the Contract performance bond , Form C-18A , and the terms and conditions therein if the Surety declines to complete the project .
The Department will also take possession of the project site and of all materials purchased for the project thereon .
If the expense of completing the Work , including compensation for additional managerial and administrative services , exceeds the unpaid balance of the Contract amount and the penal amount of the Contract performance bond , the Contractor 108.08 124 shall pay the difference to the Department , together with any other costs and expenses of terminating the Contract and having it completed by others .
2 .
If it should be judicially determined that the Department ’ s termination for default was improper or in error , then the termination shall be deemed to be a termination for con- venience and the Contractor ’ s rights and remedies shall be limited exclusively to those provided under Section 108.08 ( b ) .
3 .
Termination for default as provided herein is in addition to and without prejudice to the Department ’ s other rights or remedies .
Any of the Department ’ s actions permitted herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy of the Department under the Contract or under the law .
The Department may offset any claims it may have against the Contractor against the amounts due or to become due to the Contractor under any other contract the Contractor may have with the Commonwealth .
The provisions of this Section shall survive termination of the Contract .
4 .
When the Contractor is terminated for default , any claims timely identiﬁed in a written notice of intent may be submitted in accordance with provisions of Section 105.19 or the Code of Virginia as amended and as applicable , except that the Contractor shall submit the required claim within 60 days after the Department ’ s notice of termination for default to the Contractor .
Failure on the part of the Contractor to submit a claim within such 60-day period shall constitute a waiver and release of such claim .
108.09—Acceptance ( a ) Contractor ’ s Responsibility for Work : Until ﬁnal acceptance of the work by the Engineer in accordance with the requirements of this Section , the Contractor shall have charge and care thereof and shall take every precaution against damage to any part thereof by action of the elements or from any other cause .
The Contractor shall rebuild , repair , restore , and make good on damage to any portion of the work occasioned by any of the foregoing causes before ﬁnal acceptance and shall bear the expense thereof .
The Department may reimburse the Contractor for repair of damage to work attributable to unforeseeable causes beyond the control of and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as determined by the Engineer .
In case of suspension of work , the Contractor shall be responsible for the project and shall take such precautions as may be necessary to prevent damage to the work , provide for erosion control and drainage , and erect any necessary temporary structures , signs , or other facilities as determined by the Engineer .
During the suspension of work , the Contractor shall properly and continuously maintain in an acceptable growing condition all living material in newly estab- lished plantings , seedings , and soddings furnished under the Contract and shall take adequate precautions to protect new tree growth and other important vegetation against damage .
( b ) Partial Acceptance : If at any time during the prosecution of the project the Contractor completes a unit or portion of the project , such as a structure , an interchange , slopes , pavement , or a section of a roadway in its entirety , he may ask the Engineer to make ﬁnal inspection of such work .
If the Engineer ﬁnds upon inspection that the work conforms to the requirements of the Contract and that acceptance is in the best interest of the public , he may accept the work as being completed , and the Contractor will be relieved of further responsibility for the work .
Partial acceptance shall in no way void or alter any terms of the Contract .
108.08 125 If any damage is sustained by an accepted unit or portion of the project attributable to causes beyond the control of the Contractor , the Engineer may authorize the Contractor to make the necessary repairs .
These repairs will be paid for at the Contract price for the items requiring repair .
In the absence of Contract prices covering the items of repair , the repair work will be paid for in accordance with the requirements of Section 109.05 .
( c ) Final Acceptance : Upon receipt of a written notice from the Contractor of presumptive com- pletion of the entire project , the Engineer will make an inspection .
If all work speciﬁed in the Contract has been completed , the inspection will constitute the ﬁnal inspection and the Engineer will make the ﬁnal acceptance .
The Contractor will be notiﬁed in writing , of the de- termination of ﬁnal acceptance within ﬁve days of the date of the Engineer ’ s ﬁnal acceptance .
If the Engineer ’ s inspection discloses that any work , in whole or in part , is incomplete or unac- ceptable , the Contractor shall immediately correct the deﬁciency .
A written list of deﬁciencies will be provided to the Contractor by the Engineer .
Upon completion or correction of the work , another inspection will be made of the deﬁcient work .
If the work is then satisfactory , the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing within 5 days of the Engineer ’ s ﬁnal accep- tance .
In any event , the Contractor shall be responsible for and maintain the project until ﬁnal acceptance except under conditions that may be speciﬁcally exempted by the Speciﬁcations or other Contract documents .
108.10—Termination of Contractor ’ s Responsibilities The Contract will be considered fully complete upon ﬁnal acceptance .
The Contractor ’ s responsibility for the Work will then cease except as set forth in his bonds , and Sections 107.12 , 109.08 , 109.10 , and other provisions of the Contract that extend the Contractor ’ s responsibility beyond ﬁnal acceptance .
SECTION 109—MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT 109.01—Measurement of Quantities ( a ) General : Work speciﬁed in the Contract will be measured by the Engineer in accordance with U.S. Standard Measure .
The methods of measurement and computations to be used to deter- mine quantities of material furnished and work performed will be those generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice .
Speciﬁc methods of measurement shall be as indicated in the speciﬁc Section for the Contract item .
Longitudinal measurements for surface area computations will be made along the surface , and transverse measurements will be the surface measure shown on the plans or ordered in writing by the Engineer .
Individual areas of obstructions with a surface area of 9 square feet or less will not be deducted from surface areas measured for payment .
Structures will be measured in accordance with the neat lines shown on the plans .
Items that are measured by the linear foot will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which they are placed .
109.01 126 Allowance will not be made for surfaces placed over an area greater than that shown on the plans or for any material moved from outside the area of the cross-section and lines shown on the plans .
When standard manufactured items are speciﬁed and are identiﬁed by weights or dimensions , such identiﬁcation will be considered nominal .
Unless more stringently controlled by toleranc- es in cited speciﬁcations , manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted .
( b ) Measurement by Weight : Materials that are measured or proportioned by weight shall be weighted on accurate scales as speciﬁed in this Section .
When material is paid for on a tonnage basis , personnel performing the weighing shall be certiﬁed by the Department and shall be bond- ed to the Commonwealth of Virginia in the amount of $ 10,000 for the faithful observance and performance of the duties of the weighperson required herein .
The bond shall be executed on a form having the exact wording as the Weighpersons Surety Bond Form furnished by the Depart- ment and shall be submitted to the Department prior to the furnishing of the tonnage material .
The Contractor shall have the weighperson perform the following : 1 .
Furnish a signed weigh ticket for each load that shows the date , load number , plant name , size and type of material , project number , schedule or purchase order number , and the weights speciﬁed herein .
2 .
Maintain sufﬁcient documentation so that the accumulative tonnage and distribution of each lot of material , by Contract , can be readily identiﬁed .
3 .
Submit by the end of the next working day a summary of the number of loads and total weights for each type of material by Contract .
Trucks used to haul material shall be equipped with a cover suitable to protect the material and to protect the traveling public .
The truck tare to be used in the weighing operation shall be the weight of the empty truck de- termined with full tank ( s ) of fuel and the operator seated in the cab .
The tare weight of trucks shall be recorded to the nearest 20 pounds .
At the option of the Contractor , a new tare may be determined for each load .
When a new tare is obtained for each load , the requirement for full tank ( s ) of fuel will be waived .
Net rail shipment weights may be used for pay quantities when evidenced by railroad bills of lading .
However , such weights will not be accepted for pay quantities of materials that subse- quently pass through a stationary mixing plant .
Scales shall conform to the requirements for accuracy and sensitivity as set forth in the Nation- al Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook No .
44 for Speciﬁcation Tolerances and Requirements for Commercial and Weighing Devices .
Scales used in the weighing of materials paid for on a tonnage basis shall be approved and sealed in accordance with the requirements of the policies of the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services , or other approved agencies , at least once every six months and upon being moved .
Hopper and truck scales shall be serviced and tested by a scale service representative at least once every six months .
Hopper scales shall be checked with a minimum 500 pounds of test weights and truck scales shall be checked with a minimum 20,000 pounds of test weights .
109.01 127 Copies of scale test reports shall be maintained on ﬁle at the scale location for at least 18 months , and copies of all scale service representative test reports shall be forwarded to the Department .
The quantity of materials paid for on a tonnage basis shall be determined on scales equipped with an automatic printer .
Truck scale printers shall print the net weight and either the gross or tare weight of each load .
Hopper scale printers shall print the net weight of each load .
The weigh ticket shall also show the legal gross weight for material weighed on truck scales and the legal net weight for material weighed on hopper scales .
If the automatic printer becomes inoperative , the weighing operation may continue for 48 hours provided satisfactory visual veriﬁcation of weights can be made .
The written permission of the District Materials Engineer shall be required for the operation of scales after 48 hours .
If signiﬁcant discrepancies are discovered in the printed weight , the ultimate weight for pay- ment will be calculated on volume measurements of the materials in place and unit weights determined by the Engineer or by other methods deemed appropriate to protect the interests of the Commonwealth .
( c ) Measurement by Cubic Yard : Material that is measured by the cubic yard , loose measurement or vehicular measurement , shall be hauled in approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of delivery .
Material measured in vehicles , except streambed gravel , silt clea- nout , or other self-consolidating material will be allowed at the rate of 2/3 the volume of the vehicle .
The full volume of the vehicle will be allowed for streambed gravel .
Such vehicles may be of any size or type acceptable to the Engineer provided the body is of such shape that the actual contents can be readily and accurately determined .
Unless all approved vehicles are of uniform capacity , each vehicle shall bear a plainly legible identi- ﬁcation mark indicating the speciﬁc approved capacity .
Each vehicle shall be loaded to at least its water level capacity .
When approved by the Engineer in writing , material speciﬁed to be measured by the cubic yard may be weighed and such weights converted to cubic yards for payment purposes .
Factors for conversion from weight to volume measurement will be determined by the Engineer and shall be agreed to by the Contractor before they are used .
( d ) Measurement by Lump Sum : When used as an item of payment , the term lump sum will mean full payment for completion of the corrrsponding item of work described in the Contract .
When a complete structure or structural unit is speciﬁed as a Contract item , the unit of mea- surement will be lump sum , and shall include all necessary ﬁttings and accessories .
The quanti- ties may be shown on the plans for items for which lump sum is the method of measurement .
If shown , the quantities are approximate and are shown for estimating purposes only and no mea- surement of quantities will be made for payment .
Items that are to be measured as complete units will be counted by the Inspector in the presence of a representative of the Contractor .
( e ) Measurement for Speciﬁc Materials : 1 .
Concrete ( Measured by Volume Measure ) : Concrete will be measured and computed by dividing the work into simple geometrical ﬁgures and adding their volumes .
2 .
Concrete ( Measured by Square or Lineal Measure ) : Concrete will be measured and computed by dividing the work into simple geometrical ﬁgures and adding their areas or measuring linearly along the item ’ s surface .
109.01 128 3 .
Excavation , embankment , and borrow : In computing volumes of excavation , embank- ment , and borrow , methods having general acceptance in the engineering profession will be used .
When the measurement is based on the cross-sectional area , the average end area method will be used .
4 .
Asphalt : Asphalt will be measured by the gallon , volumetric measurement , based on a temperature of 60 degrees F using the following correction factors : a .
0.00035 per degree F for petroleum oils having a speciﬁc gravity 60/60 degrees F above 0.966 b .
0.00040 per degree F for petroleum oils having a speciﬁc gravity 60/60 degrees F between 0.850 and 0.966 c. 0.00025 per degree F for emulsiﬁed asphalt Unless volume correction tables are available , the following formula shall be used in computing the volume of asphalt at temperatures other than 60 degrees F : V1= V x [ 1 – K ( T – 60 ) ] Where : V = volume of asphalt to be corrected ; V1 = volume of asphalt at 60 degrees F ; K = correction factor ( coefﬁcient of expansion ) ; and T = temperature in degrees F of asphalt to be corrected .
When asphalt is delivered by weight , the volume at 60 degrees F will be determined by dividing the net weight by the weight per gallon at 60 degrees F. When speciﬁed in the Contract , asphalt will be measured by weight .
Net certiﬁed scale weights , or weights based on certiﬁed volumes in the case of rail shipments , will be used as a basis of measurement , subject to correction when asphalt has been lost from the car or the distributor , disposed of , or otherwise not incorporated in the work .
When asphalt is shipped by truck or transport , net certiﬁed weights or volumes subjected to correction for loss or foaming may be used to compute quantities .
Only the quantity of asphalt actually placed in the work and accepted will be considered in determining the amount due the Contractor .
5 .
Timber : Timber will be measured in units of 1,000 foot board measure actually incor- porated in the structure .
Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of each piece .
109.02—Plan Quantities When speciﬁed in the Contract , Contract items will be measured and paid for on the basis of plan quantities .
The quantities allowed for compensation will be those shown on the plans with deductions from or authorized additions to such quantities resulting from authorized deviations from the plans .
109.01 129 In the case of excavation , only excavation within the cross section prism will be paid for on a plan quantity basis .
If the Contractor believes that any plan quantity is incorrect , he may solicit , at his own expense , the aid of a Professional Engineer liscensed to practice engineering in the Commonwealth of Virginia to check the quantity or he may ask the Department in writing to check computations of the quantity .
Written requests for a quantity check by the Department shall be accompanied by calculations , drawings , or other evidence indicating why the plan quantity is believed to be in error .
If any item of the Contract is found to be in error and so veriﬁed by the Engineer , payment will be made in accordance with the corrected plan quantity .
If the Department determines during construction that there is an error in the plan quantity , or that conditions vary from those anticipated in the design to the extent that an actual measurement of a plan quantity item is warranted , the Department will make such measurement and will notify the Contractor , in writing , of the rationale for adjustment .
Payment will then be based on the measured quantity in lieu of the plan quantity .
109.03—Scope of Payment Payments to the Contractor will be made for the actual quantities of Contract items performed in accor- dance with the plans and the requirements of the Speciﬁcations and other Contract documents .
If , upon completion of the Work , the actual quantities vary , either by an increase or decrease from the estimated quantities shown in the Contract , the Contract unit prices shall prevail and payment will be made for ac- tual quantities performed at such unit prices , unless the unit prices have been modiﬁed by written change orders according to Sections 104 and 109.04 , as determined by the Engineer .
Quantities appearing on the Proposal are estimated quantities for the basic design shown on the plans .
With the Engineer ’ s approval , the Contractor may furnish other design ( s ) that may involve changes in quantities or the use of different materials .
However , payment will be made for the original quantities listed in the Contract only and in the units of measure given in the Contract for the basic design unless the dimensions for the basic design are changed by an authorized change order to conform to ﬁeld conditions encountered .
In this event , the original quantities listed will be modiﬁed based on the change in dimension , and the mod- iﬁed quantities will be used for pay quantities at Contract unit prices for the items listed on the Proposal .
The Contractor shall accept the compensation provided for in the Contract as full payment for the following : ( a ) Furnishing all materials , labor , tools , equipment , and incidentals necessary to complete the Work according to the Contract .
( b ) Performing all work speciﬁed in the Contract .
( c ) All loss or damage arising from the nature of the Work or from action of the elements or any other unforeseen difﬁculties that may be encountered during prosecution of the Work and until its ﬁnal acceptance .
( d ) Any license , use , or infringement of a patent , trademark , or copyright .
( e ) The completion of the Work in accordance with the Contract requirements .
If the payment clause in the Speciﬁcations relating to any unit price in the Contract requires that the unit price cover and be considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the item , the 109.03 130 work or material will not be measured or paid for under any other item except as provided in Section 106.05 .
The payment of any partial estimate , the ﬁnal estimate , or any retainage shall in no way affect the obliga- tion of the Contractor to repair or replace any unacceptable , unauthorized or defective work or materials , or to be responsible for all damages attributable to such unacceptable , unauthorized or defective work or materials .
109.04—Payment for Non-Signiﬁcant Changes and Additional Units of In-scope Work When the accepted quantities of work vary from the estimated quantities set forth in the Contract , wheth- er or not there have been any alterations in the plans , the quantities of work , or the character of work , the Contractor shall accept as payment in full , so far as Contract items are concerned , payment at the original Contract unit prices for the accepted quantities of work performed , except where such variance is a sig- niﬁcant change as set forth in Section 104.02 .
No allowance or other adjustment except as provided for a signiﬁcant change in Section 104.02 will be made for any increased expense , loss of expected reimburse- ment , or loss of anticipated proﬁts suffered or claimed by the Contractor resulting directly from such variance , or from the Contractor ’ s unbalanced allocation among the Contract items of overhead expense and subsequent loss of expected reimbursements therefor , or from any other cause .
109.05—Payment for Contract Changes The Department will pay the Contractor for adjustments to the Contract amount based on one of the following methods .
( a ) Payment for Extra Work The Department may add any extra work that in the judgment of the Engineer is necessary for the satisfactory fulﬁllment of the Contract within its intended scope .
Extra work may be ac- complished by change order if the scope is deﬁned as provided in this Section ( a ) , or on a force account basis , if the scope is not deﬁned as provided in Section 109.05 ( b ) .
Where possible , the Department and Contractor will each proceed to secure any information , documentation , or plans to assist in detailing the extent and character of such work , if known , in sufﬁcient detail to deﬁne , analyze , and estimate the cost and time required to perform such work .
Extra work does not include overruns of Contract items according to 104.02 .
1 .
The Engineer may notify the Contractor in writing that extra work is necessary .
When no such notice is given , but the Contractor believes extra work is necessary , he shall notify the Engineer in writing within 2 days of such a determination or before performing any such work .
If the Engineer agrees with the Contractor , the Engineer will notify the Con- tractor that extra work is necessary .
Within 7 days of the Engineer notifying the Contractor of extra work , or within such time as mutually decided with the Engineer , the Contractor shall submit a proposal that includes a determination of the extent of such work , and the additional compensation and/or time he seeks , if any , relative to his determination .
The Contractor ’ s request shall be in sufﬁcient detail to enable the Engineer to determine the basis for and extent of the Contractor ’ s entitlement to additional compensation or time .
Failure on the part of the Contractor to furnish sufﬁcient documentation or to qualify his reason for failure to do so will delay the determination of entitlement for such work .
If such delay occurs , it will in no way relieve the Contractor of his obligation to meet the 109.03 131 Contract time limits or other Contract requirements or constitute basis for a Contractor to make a delay claim .
2 .
If the Contractor requests a time extension based on extra work , the requested time extension will only be considered if the extra work impacts the critical path , a con- trolling work item , or an interim milestone established in the Contract to the extent that it extends the Completion Date of the project beyond the lattermost of the Contract Completion Date or its most recent extension .
The Contractor shall submit detailed documents and information showing how the extra work or interim milestone impacted the critical path in accordance with Section 108.04 .
Any time extension given , including time extensions in accordance with Section 108.04 , must be included in the executed change order .
3 .
Upon receipt and review of the Contractor ’ s costs for the proposed extra work , if it is found that the Contractor ’ s prices or the time differ considerably from the Department ’ s estimate , the Engineer may request the Contractor to provide support for his prices or his requested time extension .
Where the Department and the Contractor can determine and agree upon an accurate cost and time estimation for the proposed work , the Engineer will issue a Bilateral Change Order to authorize the work .
When the Contractor and the Department can not agree upon the cost or the time estimation for the extra work after the Engineer ’ s analysis and subsequent discussion with the Contractor , or where due to issues of emergency , safety , environmental damage , other similar critical factors as determined by the Department , the Engineer will act unilaterally and issue a Unilateral Change Order to authorize the work .
The issuance of a Unilateral Change Order by the Engineer shall in no way invalidate or relinquish the Contractor ’ s rights under Section 105.19 .
( b ) Payment by Force Account The Department will require the Contractor to proceed with extra work on a force account basis when neither the Department nor the Contractor can ﬁrmly establish a reliable estimate for the cost of the extra work because either the scope or the quantity of work is unknown , is of such character that a price can not be determined to a reasonable degree of accuracy , or the level of effort required to perform and complete the extra work is unknown or not quantiﬁable at the time of discovery or start of the extra work , and will be determined as work progresses .
The compensation provided for in this Section for force account work applies only to extra work the Engineer orders in writing to be performed on a force account basis , and does not apply to any other work performed under the Contract or to claims .
The Contractor shall be paid for all labor , materials , equipment , services , supplies , taxes , over- head , proﬁt and miscellaneous costs or expenses , for extra work performed on a force account basis in the following manner : 1 .
Labor : Unless otherwise approved , the Contractor will receive the rate of wage or scale as set forth in his most recent payroll for each classiﬁcation of laborers , forepersons , and superintendent ( s ) who are in direct charge of the speciﬁc operation .
The time allowed for payment will be the number of hours such workers are actually engaged in the work .
If overtime work is authorized , payment will be at the normal overtime rate set forth in the Contractor ’ s most recent payroll .
If workers performing the class of labor needed have not been employed on the project , mutually agreed on rates will be established .
However , the rates shall be not less than those predetermined for the project , if applicable .
An amount equal to 45 percent of the approved force account payroll will be included in the payment 109.05 132 for labor to cover administrative costs , proﬁt , and beneﬁts and/or deductions normally paid by the Contractor .
2 .
Insurance and Tax : The Contractor will receive an amount equal to 25 percent of the approved force account payroll exclusive of additives of administrative cost as full com- pensation for property damage and liability , workers ’ compensation insurance premiums , unemployment insurance contributions , and social security taxes of force account work .
3 .
Materials : The Contractor will receive the actual cost of materials accepted by the Engineer that are delivered and used for the work including taxes , transportation , and handling charges paid by the Contractor , not including labor and equipment rentals as herein set forth , to which 15 percent of the cost will be added for administration and proﬁt .
The Contractor shall make every reasonable effort to take advantage of trade discounts offered by material suppliers .
Any discount received shall pass through to the Department .
Sal- vageable temporary construction materials will be retained by the Department , or their appropriate salvage value shall be credited to the Commonwealth , as agreed on by the Department .
4 .
Equipment : The Contractor shall provide the Engineer a list of all equipment to be used in the work .
For each piece of equipment , the list shall include the serial number ; date of manufacture ; location from which equipment will be transported ; and , for rental equip- ment , the rental rate and name of the company from which it is rented .
The Contractor will be paid rental rates for pieces of machinery , equipment , and attachments necessary for prosecution of the work that are approved for use by the Engineer .
Equipment rental will be measured by time in hours of actual time engaged in the performance of the work and necessary traveling time of the equipment within the limits of the project or source of supply and the project .
Hourly rates will not exceed 1/176 of the monthly rates of the schedule shown in the Rental Rate Blue Book modiﬁed in accordance with the Rental Rate Blue Book rate adjustment tables that are current at the time the force account is authorized .
Equipment rental rates not modiﬁed by the adjustment factors or rate modi- ﬁcations indicated in the Rental Rate Blue Book will not be considered .
Hourly rates for equipment on standby will be at 50 percent of the rate paid for equipment performing work .
Operating costs shall not be included in the standby rate .
For the purposes herein “ standby time ” is deﬁned as the period of time equipment ordered to the jobsite by the Engineer is available on-site for the work but is idle for reasons not the fault of the Con- tractor or normally associated with the efﬁcient and necessary use of that equipment in the overall operation of the work at hand .
Payment will be made for the total hours the equipment is performing work .
When equipment is performing work less than 40 hours for any given week and is on standby , payment for standby time will be allowed for up to 40 hours , minus hours performing work .
Payment will not be made for the time that equipment is on the project in excess of 24 hours prior to its actual performance in the force account work .
An amount equal to the Rental Rate Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour will be paid for all hours the equipment is performing work .
This operating cost shall be full compensation for fuel , lubricants , repairs , greasing , fueling , oiling , small tools , and other incidentals .
No compensation will be paid for the use of machinery or equipment not authorized by the Engineer .
The Contractor will be paid freight cost covering the moving of equipment to and from the speciﬁc force account operation provided such cost is supported by an invoice showing 109.05 133 the actual cost to the Contractor .
However , such payment will be limited to transportation from the nearest source of available equipment .
If equipment is not returned to the nearest equipment storage lot but is moved to another location , the freight cost paid will not ex- ceed the cost of return to the nearest storage lot .
The rates for equipment not listed in the Rental Rate Blue Book schedule shall not exceed the hourly rate being paid for such equipment by the Contractor at the time of the force account authorization .
In the absence of such rates , prevailing rates being paid in the area where the authorized work is to be performed shall be used .
If the Contractor does not possess or have readily available equipment necessary for per- forming the force account work and such equipment is rented from a source other than a company that is an afﬁliate of the Contractor , payment will be based on actual invoice rates , to which 15 percent of the invoice cost will be added for administrative cost and proﬁt .
If the invoice rate does not include the furnishing of fuel , lubricants , repairs , and servicing , the invoice rate will be converted to an hourly rate , and an amount equal to the Rental Rate Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour will be added for each hour the equipment is performing work .
5 .
Miscellaneous : No additional allowance will be made for attachments that are common accessories for equipment as deﬁned in the Rental Rate Blue Book , general superinten- dents , timekeepers , secretaries , the use of small hand held tools or other costs for which no speciﬁc allowance is herein provided .
The Contractor will receive compensation equal to the cost of the bond , special railroad insurance premiums , and other additional costs necessary for the speciﬁc force account work as determined by the Department .
The Con- tractor shall supply documented evidence of such costs .
6 .
Compensation : The compensation as set forth in this Section shall be accepted by the Contractor as payment in full for work performed on a force account basis .
At the end of each day , the Contractor ’ s representative and the Inspector shall compare and reconcile records of the hours of work and equipment , labor and materials used in the work as ordered on a force account basis .
Such accounting may not include actual costs or labor rates where these are not available but shall be used to verify quantities , types of materials or labor , and number and types of equipment .
If all or a portion of the force account work is performed by an approved subcontractor , the Contractor will be paid 10 percent of the subcontract net force account costs to cover the Contractor ’ s proﬁt and administrative cost .
The amount resulting will not be subject to any further additives .
The itemized statements of costs as required below shall be sub- mitted on a form that separates the subcontracted portions of the force account labor , materials , and equipment from the other force account costs .
7 .
Statements : Payments will not be made for work performed on a force account basis until the Contractor has furnished the Engineer duplicate itemized statements of the cost of such work detailed as follows : a. payroll indicating name , classiﬁcation , date , daily hours , total hours , rate , and exten- sion of each laborer , foreperson , and superintendent .
b. designation , dates , daily hours , total hours , rental rate , and extension for each unit of equipment .
109.05 134 c. quantities of materials , prices , and extensions .
d. transportation of materials .
Statements shall be accompanied and supported by invoices for all materials used and transpor- tation charges .
However , if materials used on the force account work are not speciﬁcally pur- chased for such work but are taken from the Contractor ’ s stock , then in lieu of the invoices , the Contractor shall furnish an afﬁdavit certifying that such materials were taken from his stock ; that the quantity claimed was actually used ; and that the price , transportation , and handling claimed represented his actual cost .
( c ) Payment for Signiﬁcant Changes When the Contractor alleges that there is a signiﬁcant change as deﬁned in Section 104.02 , then , within a mutually agreed upon timeframe , he shall submit a request for the additional compensation , excluding anticipated proﬁts for reduced or eliminated work , for such signif- icant change .
The Contractor ’ s request shall be in sufﬁcient detail to enable the Engineer to determine the basis for and extent of the Contractor ’ s entitlement to additional compensation .
Failure on the part of the Contractor to furnish sufﬁcient documentation or to qualify his reason for failure to do so will delay the determination of entitlement to additional compensation .
If such delay occurs , it will in no way relieve the Contractor of his obligation to meet milestone dates , the Contract time limit , or other Contract requirements , or constitute the basis for a claim of any kind .
( d ) Payment for Differing Site Conditions When the Contractor encounters a differing site condition as deﬁned in Section 104.03 , then , within a mutually agreed upon timeframe , he shall submit a written request for the additional compensation , excluding anticipated proﬁts , he seeks as a result of such condition .
The Con- tractor ’ s request shall be in sufﬁcient detail to enable the Engineer to determine the basis for and extent of the Contractor ’ s entitlement to additional compensation .
Failure on the part of the Contractor to furnish sufﬁcient documentation or to qualify his reason for failure to do so will delay the determination of entitlement to additional compensation .
If such delay occurs , it will in no way relieve the Contractor of his obligation to meet the Contract time limits or other Contract requirements or constitute basis for a claim of any kind .
If the Engineer determines that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or de- crease in the cost required for the performance of any of the Work , an adjustment , excluding anticipated proﬁts , will be made and the Contract may be modiﬁed accordingly .
( e ) Payment for Compensable Delay The Contractor is entitled to compensation for a compensable delay .
Compensable delays are critical delays that are not the Contractor ’ s fault or responsibility and are the Department ’ s fault or responsibility .
Compensable delays may include , but are not limited to : • Delays due to alteration of quantities or character of work according to 104.02 .
• Delays due to differing site conditions according to 104.03 .
• Delays due to an Engineer-ordered suspension according to 108.05 .
109.05 135 • Delays due to the acts or omissions of the Department or its failure to act in a timely manner .
The following delays are not compensable : • Acts or omissions of the Contractor , its agents , employees , subcontractors or suppliers or causes within their control ; or conditions that the Contractor could reasonably have fore- seen or avoided .
• Floods , tidal waves , tornadoes , hurricanes , lightning strikes , earthquakes , ﬁres , epidemics , or similar natural phenomena .
• Normal adverse weather .
• Extraordinary , unforeseen , and unavoidable delays in material deliveries .
• Acts of government entities other than the Department .
• Unforeseen and unavoidable industry-wide labor strikes affecting the Contractor or its subcontractors ’ or suppliers ’ workforce that are beyond the Contractor ’ s control .
• Actions of third parties that are not the responsibility of the Contractor or within it ’ s or the Department ’ s control .
• Civil disturbances or sovereign acts of the State , including but are not limited to states of emergency or epidemic or quarantine restrictions .
To request payment for a compensable delay , the Contractor shall within 14 days after the end date of a delay event , unless directed otherwise in writing by the Engineer , submit a written request for a change order for the Engineer ’ s approval .
With the request , the Contractor shall submit a Schedule Impact Analysis ( SIA ) and all supporting data to objectively substantiate its request .
The Engineer will evaluate the Contractor ’ s SIA and all supporting data to determine entitlement and the appropriate amount of compensation , according to the following : 1 .
Field Ofﬁce Overhead ( FOOH ) a. FOOH is the extended project ﬁeld ofﬁce overhead and site costs and expenses that are not attributable to speciﬁc Contract pay items , but are incurred in support of the project as a result of a delay , which include : ( 1 ) Extended site supervision costs such as salaries for project ﬁeld superintendent and administrative staff .
( 2 ) Extended site ofﬁce costs such as utilities , trailers , ﬁeld ofﬁce , ofﬁce equipment , and sanitary and toilet facilities .
( 3 ) Extended site equipment and tool costs for support equipment and tools that are not used for speciﬁc Contract pay items .
b .
The Contractor is entitled to FOOH only for compensable delays for which the Engineer has granted a Contract time extension .
The Contractor is not entitled to ad- ditional compensation for FOOH for delays that are caused by extra work performed on a Force Account basis or for increased quantities .
109.05 136 c. The Contractor ’ s agreed amount of compensation for FOOH shall be based on the project daily FOOH rate derived from the Contractor ’ s Itemized Project FOOH Costs set out on the Department ’ s form or other format acceptable to the Engineer .
The Contractor shall submit the form to the Engineer no later than 30 days after the Notice to Proceed date or on a date approved by the Engineer .
On the form , the Contractor shall list each project FOOH item , the total estimated costs or expenses for each FOOH item for the original Contract time , the total project FOOH , and the project daily FOOH rate based on the total project FOOH divided by the original Contract duration .
The compensation for FOOH will be calculated as follows : ( Daily FOOH Rate ) x ( No .
of Days of Compensable Delay ) = ( Amount of FOOH Liquidated Damages ) 2 .
Home Ofﬁce Overhead ( HOOH ) HOOH is the Contractor ’ s allowable home ofﬁce overhead costs and expenses that can not be attributed and are not billed to a particular project , but are incurred in support of all of the Contractor ’ s projects , including but not limited to rent , ofﬁce equipment and furnishings , insurance , ofﬁce supplies , depreciation , taxes , and utilities , as well as executive salaries , ad- ministrative staff salaries , project support staff salaries , and accounting and payroll services .
a .
The Contractor is entitled to payment of HOOH only for compensable delays for which the Engineer has granted a Contract time extension and only when the Con- tractor could not reasonably recoup its HOOH while its workforce was idled by the delay because the Contractor was required to remain on standby , ready to resume work , and unable to perform other work at the project or elsewhere during the delay .
The Contractor is not entitled to compensation for HOOH for delays that are caused by extra work performed on a Force Account basis or by increased quantities .
b .
The agreed amount of compensation for extended or unabsorbed HOOH for a compensable delay will be determined as follows : ( A×C ) B = D D×E = F Where : A = Original total Contract amount B = Original Contract duration ( number of calendar days between and inclusive of the Contract Notice to Proceed ( NTP ) date and the original Contract Completion Date ) C = 6 % ( Agreed allowable HOOH percentage ) D = Daily allowable HOOH rate E = Number of days of compensable delay F = Agreed amount of compensation for HOOH 3 .
When to Audit to Determine FOOH and HOOH The Contractor may propose a higher rate determined according to Federal Acquisition Regulations 48 CFR § 31 or other accounting standard if the Contractor determines that the agreed allowable HOOH percentage is insufﬁcient .
109.05 137 The Itemized Project FOOH Costs ( IPFC ) and FOOH shall be subject to ﬁeld veriﬁcation and Department audit , at any time , as determined by the Engineer , if the Engineer deter- mines that the rate the Contractor submits is not an accurate representation of the Contrac- tor ’ s actual FOOH at the time of occurrence of the delay .
If the Engineer determines the daily FOOH rate is not an accurate representation of the Contractor ’ s actual FOOH , the Contractor shall submit its actual project FOOH records at the time of occurrence of the delay , as requested by the Engineer .
The Department may perform an audit of the Contrac- tor ’ s records as necessary to verify the Contractor ’ s actual project FOOH .
Adjustments to the daily FOOH rate may be made upon veriﬁcation or Department audit of the Contrac- tor ’ s actual project FOOH .
The project daily FOOH rate will then be calculated utilizing the rate determined by the audit .
The Department may also elect to perform an audit of the Contractor ’ s actual project FOOH at the completion of the Contract , as determined by the Engineer , in which case the project FOOH paid previously by change order may be adjusted based on the rate determined by the audit .
The Contractor ’ s actual extended FOOH are deﬁned to be those costs and expenses in- curred from the original Contract time limit to the actual ﬁnal acceptance of the project as documented by timesheets , payroll records , accounting records , contracts , invoices , bills , receipts , tickets , cancelled checks , and similar business records showing the costs and expenses actually incurred for the project ﬁeld supervision and administrative staff , project ﬁeld ofﬁce , and overhead items submitted in accordance with this provision ; and the records must be accurate and auditable .
If the total sum of the extended project FOOH and unabsorbed or extended HOOH for all approved change orders exceeds 20 percent of the original Contract amount , the Depart- ment may at its option calculate the amount of FOOH and HOOH based on a Department audit of the Contractor ’ s actual project FOOH and HOOH records .
In such event , the De- partment will perform the audit according to Section 103.08 at the Department ’ s expense .
The Department audit may begin on 10-days notice to the Contractor , its subcontractors , and suppliers .
The Contractor , subcontractors , and suppliers shall make a good faith effort to cooperate with the auditors .
4 .
Other Delay Costs The Contractor may incur costs attributable to compensable delays in addition to FOOH and HOOH .
These costs include , but are not limited to , labor cost escalation , material costs escalation , idle equipment costs , and idle labor costs .
These costs shall be deter- mined according to the applicable provisions herein .
109.06—Common Carrier Rates The common carrier rates and taxes thereon that are current on the date of the opening of bids shall be considered applicable to all items subject to transportation charges thereunder .
If such rates or taxes are thereafter increased by public authority on any materials entering into and forming a part of the Contract , an amount equal to the sum of all such increases , when evidenced by receipted common carrier bills , will be paid the Contractor by the Department .
Requests for such payments shall be made not later than 60 days after ﬁnal acceptance .
If , after the date of the opening of bids , such rates or taxes are reduced by public authority on any materials entering into and forming a part of the Contract , an amount equal to the sum of all such decreases , when evidenced by receipted common carrier bills , will be deducted by the Department from the monies due the Contractor for the work performed under the Contract .
109.06 138 The carrier rates for petroleum tank truck carriers , as deﬁned in the Code of Virginia , that are in effect on the date of the opening of bids for the project shall be considered effective for at least one year after that date .
After one year from that date , the Department will pay the Contractor additional compensation equal to the cost of any carrier rate increases , subject to a maximum of eight percent of the original car- rier rate for any materials ordered , delivered , and actually incorporated into the work after the one year period .
However , the Contractor shall advise the Engineer in writing of his intent to request additional compensation attributable to carrier rate changes at the time of occurrence and shall submit receipted carrier bills and all relative information concerning the original and current carrier rates as they pertain to the project .
If carrier rates are decreased after the one year period , the Department will deduct from mon- ies due the Contractor an amount equal to the cost of any carrier rate decreases , subject to a maximum of eight percent of the original carrier rate , for any materials ordered , delivered , and actually incorporated into the work , based on receipted carrier bills that shall be furnished by the Contractor .
On each succeed- ing year of the Contract , a maximum difference of eight percent of the original rate will be considered for increases or decreases in compensation under these terms and conditions .
Except for the aforementioned carriers , additional compensation attributable to changes in hauling rates of other contract carriers will not be allowed .
109.07—Eliminated Items If all or a part of any Contract item is determined to be unnecessary for the proper completion of the Work , the Department may , upon written notice to the Contractor and issuance of an appropriate change order , eliminate all or part of such item from the Contract .
Payment will not be made for such item except that the Contractor will be compensated for the actual cost of any work performed for such item and the net cost of materials purchased , including freight and tax costs , as evidenced by invoice .
No additional compensation will be made for overhead or anticipated proﬁt .
109.08—Partial Payments ( a ) General Partial payments will be based on a monthly progress estimate consisting of approximate quan- tities and value of work performed as determined by the Engineer .
When the method of mea- surement for a Contract item is in units of each or lump sum , the value of work accomplished for partial payment will be determined on a pro rata basis .
Partial payments will be made once each month for the work performed in accordance with the Contract requirements .
The Contractor will be given the opportunity to review the monthly progress estimate prior to each partial payment .
Upon ﬁnal acceptance , one last monthly estimate will be prepared and any additional payment due will be vouchered for payment .
The monthly progress estimates will be prepared in accordance with the following schedule : 1 .

The Contractor ’ s bonding company shall be responsible for insuring payment in accordance with this Section and Section 107.01 .
( c ) Retainage If the Engineer determines the Contractor ’ s progress is unsatisfactory according to Section 108.03 or other applicable Contract documents , the Engineer will send a notice of unsatis- factory progress to the Contractor advising him of such determination .
This notiﬁcation will also advise the Contractor that ﬁve percent retainage of the monthly progress estimate is being withheld and will continue to be withheld for each month the Contractor ’ s actual progress is determined to be unsatisfactory .
When the Engineer determines that the Contractor ’ s progress is satisfactory in accordance with these requirements , the 5 percent retainage previously withheld because of unsatisfactory progress will be released in the next monthly progress estimate , and the remaining month- ly progress estimates will be paid in full provided the Contractor ’ s progress continues to be satisfactory .
109.09—Payment for Material on Hand When requested in writing by the Contractor , payment allowances may be made for materials secured for use on the project and required to complete the project .
Such material payments will be made for only those actual quantities of materials identiﬁed in the Contract , approved change orders , or otherwise authorized and documented by the Engineer based on delivery tickets , bills of lading , or paid invoices .
All such payments shall be in accordance with the following terms and conditions : ( a ) Structural Steel or Reinforcing Steel : An allowance of 100 percent of the cost to the Contrac- tor for structural steel or reinforcing steel materials secured for fabrication not to exceed 60 per- cent of the Contract price may be made when such material is delivered to the fabricator and has been adequately identiﬁed for exclusive use on the project .
The provisions of this section for steel reinforcement will only apply where the quantity of steel reinforcement is identiﬁed as a separate and distinct bid item for payment .
An allowance of 100 percent of the cost to the Contractor for superstructure units and reinforcing steel , not to exceed 90 percent of the Contract price , may be made when fabrication is complete .
Prior to the granting of such allowances , the materials and fabricated units shall have been tested or certiﬁed and found acceptable to the Department and shall have been stored in accordance with the requirements speciﬁed herein .
Allowances will be based on invoices , bills , or the estimated value as approved by the Engineer and will be subject to the retainage requirements of Section 109.08 .
For the purposes of this section fabrication is deﬁned as any manufacturing process such as bending , forming , welding , cutting or coating with paint or anti-corrosive materials which alters , converts , or changes raw material for its use in the permanent ﬁnished work .
( b ) Other Materials : For aggregate , pipe , guardrail , signs and sign assemblies , and other nonper- ishable material , an allowance of 100 percent of the cost to the Contractor for materials , not to exceed 90 percent of the Contract price , may be made when such material is delivered to the project and stockpiled or stored in accordance with the requirements speciﬁed herein .
Prior to the granting of such allowances , the material shall have been tested and found acceptable to the Department .
Allowances will be based on invoices , bills , or the estimated value of the material as approved by the Engineer and will be subject to the retainage provisions of Section 109.08 .
109.08 141 ( c ) Excluded Items : No allowance will be made for fuels , form lumber , falsework , temporary structures , or other work that will not become an integral part of the ﬁnished construction .
Additionally , no allowance will be made for perishable material such as cement , seed , plants , or fertilizer .
( d ) Storage : Material for which payment allowance is requested shall be stored in an approved manner in areas where damage is not likely to occur .
If any of the stored materials are lost or become damaged , the Contractor shall repair or replace them at no additional cost to the Department .
Repair or replacement of such material will not be considered the basis for any extension of Contract time .
If payment allowance has been made prior to such damage or loss , the amount so allowed or a proportionate part thereof will be deducted from the next progress estimate payment and withheld until satisfactory repairs or replacement has been made .
When it is determined to be impractical to store materials within the limits of the project , the Engineer may approve storage on private property or , for structural units and reinforcing steel , on the manufacturer ’ s or fabricator ’ s yard .
Requests for payment allowance for such stored material shall be accompanied by a release from the owner or tenant of such property or yard agreeing to permit the removal of the materials from the property without cost to the Common- wealth .
The Department must be allowed access to the materials for inspection during normal business hours .
( e ) Materials Inventory : If the Contractor requests a payment allowance for properly stored material , he shall submit a certiﬁed and itemized inventory statement to the Engineer no earlier than 5 days and no later than 2 days prior to the progress estimate date .
The statement shall be submitted on forms furnished by the Department and shall be accompanied by supplier ’ s or manufacturer ’ s invoices or other documents that will verify the material ’ s cost .
Following the initial submission , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a monthly-certiﬁed update of the itemized inventory statement within the same time frame .
The updated inventory state- ment shall show additional materials received and stored with invoices or other documents and shall list materials removed from storage since the last certiﬁed inventory statement , with appropriate cost data reﬂecting the change in the inventory .
If the Contractor fails to submit the monthly-certiﬁed update within the speciﬁed time frame , the Engineer will deduct the full amount of the previous statement from the progress estimate .
At the conclusion of the project , the cost of material remaining in storage for which payment allowance has been made will be deducted from the progress estimate .
109.10—Final Payment When ﬁnal acceptance has been duly made by the Engineer as provided for in Section 108.09 the Engineer will prepare the ﬁnal statement of the quantities of the items of work performed .
Thereafter , the Contractor will be afforded 10 days in which to review the ﬁnal estimate before payment .
The time may be extended by mutual agreement , and the extension added to the 90-day criteria set forth within this Section .
Prior partial estimates and payments shall be subject to correction in the ﬁnal estimate and payment .
For Contracts not requiring a payment bond , the Contractor shall certify to the Department that he has paid or made satisfactory arrangements for settling all bills for materials , labor , equipment , supplies , and other items entering into or used on the work and shall furnish other certiﬁcates as are required by the Department as a prerequisite to the issuance of ﬁnal payment .
109.10 142 Failure by the Contractor to provide required information and certiﬁcations will extend the 90-day period for ﬁnal payment by the number of days equivalent to the delay attributable to the Contractor .
Upon review of the ﬁnal estimate by the Contractor and approval by the Engineer , the Contractor will be paid the entire sum due after previous payments are deducted and other amounts are retained or de- ducted under the provisions of the Contract .
Final payment will become due within 90 days after ﬁnal acceptance .
Interest will accrue on the amount the Department owes to the Contractor that remains unpaid after 7 days following the 90-day payment date .
The rate of interest will be the base rate on corporate loans ( prime rate ) at large U.S. money center commercial banks as reported daily in The Wall Street Journal .
When a split rate is published , the lower of the two rates shall be used .
The rate effective on the 91st day following ﬁnal acceptance will be applicable throughout the period of time for which interest is paid .
However , in no event shall the rate of interest paid exceed the rate of interest established pursuant to the Code of Virginia .
The period subject to payment of interest will begin on the 91st calendar day after ﬁnal acceptance and will extend through the date of the payment of the ﬁnal estimate .
When the payment date is delayed beyond the 90-day period by the fault of the Contractor and monies are due the Commonwealth , the Contractor will be assessed annual interest on the balance due the Com- monwealth for the time delay attributable to the Contractor .
The rate of interest will be determined as speciﬁed hereinbefore .
The Department may deduct monies owed to the Commonwealth from the ﬁnal payment .
If the ﬁnal payment is insufﬁcient , monies owed to the Commonwealth will become due and payable within 30 days of Contractor ’ s receipt of a certiﬁed letter giving notiﬁcation of the amount owed .
The Contractor will be assessed annual interest at the rate determined as speciﬁed within this Section for any balance that remains unpaid after 37 days from receipt of the letter .
After ﬁnal acceptance and prior to ﬁnal payment , the Contractor may request reimbursement for addi- tional performance and payment bond premiums , but only to the extent that the ﬁnal Contract amount exceeds the original Contract amount .
If the Contractor requests reimbursement on such additional bond premiums the Contractor shall submit to the Department a written request for reimbursement , together with a notarized statement from the surety , or its agent that certiﬁes the Contractor ’ s actual bond premium rate for any increase in the amended Contract amount above the original Contract amount .
Such request shall also contain the Contractor ’ s calculation of the additional premium requested for reimbursement as veriﬁed by the surety or its agent .
Upon submission of such request from the Contractor , the Department will calculate the additional bond premium payment due the Contractor by multiplying the difference between the ﬁnal Contract amount , including all change orders , overruns , and adjustments , and the original Contract amount , times the percentage bond premium rate provided by the Contractor and certiﬁed by the surety or its agent .
The additional premium amount will be paid to the Contractor on the ﬁnal estimate .

Field SUPERPAVE tests will be performed by the Department in accordance with AASHTO R35 during the production of the approved job mixes designed by the SUPERPAVE method .
Aging , as described in AASHTO R30 , will not be performed .
Should any ﬁeld SUPERPAVE test fail with regard to the limits speciﬁed in Table II-14 , the Department may require that production be stopped until necessary correc- tive action is taken by the Contractor .
The Engineer will investigate and determine the acceptability of material placed and represented by failing ﬁeld SUPERPAVE test results .
Should visual examination by the Engineer reveal that the material in any load or portion of the paved roadway is obviously contaminated or segregated , that load or portion of the paved roadway will be re- jected without additional sampling or testing of the lot .
If it is necessary to determine the gradation or asphalt content of the material in any load or portion of the paved roadway , samples will be taken and tested and the results will be compared to the requirements of the approved job-mix formula .
The results obtained in the testing will apply only to the material in question .
211.09—Adjustment System If a lot of material does not conform to the acceptance requirements of Section 211.08 , the Department will determine adjustment points as follows : Adjustment Points for Each 1 % the Gradation Is Outside the Process Tolerance Permitted In Table II-15 Sieve Size ( Applied in 0.1 % increments ) 1 1/2 in 1 1 in 1 3/4 in 1 1/2 in 1 3/8 in 1 No .

If the total adjustment for a lot is greater than 25 points , the Contractor shall remove the failing material from the road .
If the total adjustment is 25 points or less and the Contractor does not elect to remove and replace the material , the unit price for the material will be reduced 1 percent of the unit price bid for each adjustment point the material is outside of the process tolerance .
The Engineer will apply this adjustment to the tonnage represented by the sample ( s ) .
If the Engineer applies adjustment points against two successive lots , the Contractor shall ensure plant adjustment is made prior to continuing production .
The Contractor shall control the variability of the Contractor ’ s product in order to furnish a consistently uniform mix .
When the quantity of any one type of material furnished to a project exceeds 4,000 tons , the variability of the total quantity furnished will be determined on the basis of the standard deviation for each sieve size and the asphalt content .
If the standard deviation is within the ranges speciﬁed in Table II-16 , the Engineer will adjust the unit bid price for the material as indicated herein .
The Engineer will not make adjustments for standard deviation computations on more than two job mixes for the same type of material .
The Engineer will reduce the unit bid price by 0.5 percent for each adjustment point applied for standard deviation .

2 It should be noted that the pH and soluble salt content of the amended soil mix is more relevant to the establishment and growth of a particular plant , than is the pH or soluble salt content of a speciﬁc com- post ( soil conditioner ) used to amend the soil .
Each speciﬁc plant species requires a speciﬁc pH range .
Each plant also has a salinity tolerance rating , and maximum tolerable quantities are known .
Most ornamental plants and turf species can tolerate a soil/media soluble salt level of 2.5 dS/m and 4 dS/m , respectively .
Seeds , young seedlings and salt sensitive species often prefer soluble salt levels at half the aforementioned levels .
When specifying the establishment of any plant or turf species , it is important to understand their pH and soluble salt requirements , and how they relate to existing soil conditions .
3 Stability/Maturity rating is an area of compost science that is still evolving , and as such , other various 282 244.02 test methods could be considered .
Also , never base compost quality conclusions on the result of a single stability/maturity test .

All other pipe shall be considered pipe culverts .
Post installation inspections shall be performed on straight line and radial installations .
A minimum of one pipe culvert installation for each size of each material type used on the project will be randomly selected by the Engineer for inspection ; however , in no case will the amount of pipe subject to inspection be less than ten percent of the total contract amount for the size and material type indicated .
Where the pipe or culvert ’ s size , orientation , or location permit deﬂection to be easily visually identiﬁed , ( as veriﬁed with the Engineer ) the Contractor may perform visual inspections in lieu of video inspections .
If defects as described herein are noted during the inspection , the Engineer may require additional pipe installations of that size and/or material be inspected .
The Contractor shall coordinate and schedule all post installation inspections so that these are made in the presence of the Engineer .
The post installation inspec- tion shall be performed no sooner than 30 days after completion of the pipe installation and placement of ﬁnal cover ( except for pavement structure ) .
The Contractor shall issue a report detailing all issues or deﬁciencies noted during the inspection ( including a remediation plan for each deﬁciency noted where applicable ) no later than 5 days after completion of the inspection .
The post installation inspection shall be performed prior to paving unless project scheduling dictates that a particular site be paved before the end of the 30 day period .
In such cases , a pre- liminary inspection of the pipe shall be made prior to paving over it , to insure that the pipe has been properly installed and is performing well .
Performing such a preliminary inspection prior to paving will not relieve the Contractor from the requirement to perform the post installation inspection after the 30 day period .
The Contractor ’ s inspection report shall identify and address any of the following items ob- served during the post installation inspection including identifying any proposed remedia- tion measures the Contractor plans to perform where applicable .
Remediation measures may consist of repairing or replacing the defective pipe section ( s ) or a combination of the two where differing conditions exist within the same run of pipe .
Where permitted as an option , remediation methods for the various installation defects shall be proposed by the Contractor , reviewed with the Engineer and must have the Engineer ’ s approval prior to implementation of the corrective action .
Remediation shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor .
Further , if remediation measures are shown to be necessary , any time associated with such measures 302.03 338 shall be reﬂected in the impact to the Contractor ’ s progress schedule ( may take the form of a time impact analysis , where required by the scheduling requirements ) and will not relieve the Contractor of his responsibilities to ﬁnish the work required by the contract within the contract time limits or form the basis for any claim of delay where such remediation measures are determined to be a result of the Contractor ’ s fault , omission or negligence .
Upon completion of any corrective remedial measures , the corrected installations are to be re-inspected prior to ﬁnal acceptance of the project using the test methods identiﬁed in VTM 123 .
The following criteria shall form the basis for inspections for the respective pipe or culvert types listed : 1 .
All pipe and culvert types : Misalignment : Vertical and horizontal alignment of the pipe culvert or storm drain pipe barrel shall be checked by sighting along the crown , invert and sides of the pipe , and by checking for sagging , faulting and invert heaving .
Faulting is deﬁned herein as differential settlement between joints of the pipe , creating a non-uniform proﬁle of the pipe .
The per- son assigned by the Contractor to perform the inspection should take into account pipe or culvert laid with a designed camber or grade change in accordance with Contract or site requirements .
Horizontal alignment shall be checked for straightness or smooth curva- ture .
Any issues involving incorrect horizontal and/or vertical alignment shall be noted in the inspection report .
If any vertical and/or horizontal misalignment problems are visually noted by the Engineer or in the inspection report , a further evaluation will be conducted by the Engineer to determine the impact of the misalignment on the joints and wall of the pipe to ascertain what corrective actions are needed .
All corrective actions determined necessary by the Engineer that are a result of the Contractor ’ s negligence , omission or fault shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to remedy .

Completed Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form for each proposed pile hammer and pile type combination .
2 .
At each driving test location , where different subsurface conditions exist , the Contractor shall furnish a Wave Equation Analysis of pile driving performed by a Professional Engi- neer experienced in such work , demonstrating that the piles can be driven with reasonable effort to the required penetration , length and capacity without damage .
This analysis shall include the following : Copies of computer input and output sheets and graphs showing soil resistance ver- sus blow count as well as maximum tensile and compressive stresses versus blow count .
Analyses shall be run at the estimated tip elevation as well as other higher elevations to deﬁne maximum stress levels in the pile during driving or a drivability analysis can be performed .
Soil setup ( pile freeze effect ) may be considered when establishing initial driving criteria .
If soil setup is considered , two wave equation analyses , one modeling initial drivability and the second modeling the beginning of restrike conditions , must be performed .
However , hammers requiring the consideration of soil setup for approval may require restrikes of the driving test piles , at the Contractors expense , for veriﬁcation purposes .
After the driving test piles have been installed , if initial parameters selected are judged to be inappropriate , the Contractor may be required to submit a reﬁned wave equation analysis along with the pile order list .
The reﬁned analysis shall include any modiﬁcations or changes deemed appropriate .
The Engineer will determine driving resistance criteria and/or minimum tip elevations to be used for production piles from the above information .
( d ) Dynamic Formula A dynamic formula should not be used if the required nominal resistance is more than 600 kips .
When a dynamic formula is speciﬁed to establish the driving criterion , the FHWA Gates For- mula speciﬁed here in should be used .
The nominal pile resistance as measured during driving using this method shall be taken as follows : Rndr = 1.75 ( Ed ) 0.5 log10 ( 10Nb ) -100 where : Rndr = nominal pile resistance measured during pile driving ( kips ) 461 403.08 Ed = developed hammer energy .
This is the kinetic energy in the ram at impact for a given blow .
If ram velocity is not measured , it may be assumed equal to the potential energy of the ram at the height of the stroke , taken as the ram weight times the actual stroke ( ft-Ibs ) Nb = number of hammer blows for 1.0 in .
of pile permanent set ( blows/in . )
If a dynamic formula other than those provided herein is used , it shall be calibrated based on measured static load test results to obtain an appropriate resistance factor , consistent with Article CI0.5.5.2 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Speciﬁcations .
This formula is applicable only when ( 1 ) the hammer has a free fall , ( 2 ) the head of the pile is not broomed or crushed , ( 3 ) the penetration is reasonably quick and uniform , or ( 4 ) a follower is not used .
If the Engineer determines that energy losses attributable to pile rebound exceed the nominal values assumed in this formula , the nominal pile resistance shall be reevaluated by wave equa- tion analysis that rationally considers energy losses in the cap , pile , and soil .
403.08—Driving Criteria : ( a ) Bearing : Bearing resistance values for concrete and steel piles shall be determined by the loading tests speciﬁed in 403.07 ( a ) .
In the absence of loading tests , nominal pile resistance may be determined using a dynamic pile test during pile driving speciﬁed in 403.07 ( b ) or results of wave equation analysis in 403.07 ( c ) .
In the absence of loading tests , wave equation analysis , or a dynamic test , the nominal pile resistance may be approximated by using the pile formula speciﬁed in 403.07 ( d ) .
The character of the soil penetrated ; conditions of driving ; followers ; size , length , and weight of the piles ; and computed load per pile shall be given due consideration in determining the nominal pile resistance .
Bearing piles shall be driven until the blow count determined to produce the required nominal pile resistance has been continuously maintained for 2 feet or to practical refusal , whichever occurs ﬁrst .
( b ) Practical Refusal : Practical refusal is deﬁned as twice the blow count required to produce nominal pile resistance .
In the case of driving to a very dense or hard stratum , the driving criterion should be based on blows per inch criterion and should address limiting the blows following an abrupt refusal to prevent damage .
In no case shall driving continue for more than 3 inches at practical refusal driving conditions .
Based on the results of the wave equation , dynamic analysis and/or the driving test , the Engi- neer may elect to adjust the criteria for practical refusal but in no case shall practical refusal be greater than 20 blows per inch .
( c ) A pile shall not be driven above the blow count where wave equation analysis or dynamic testing results indicates that maximum stress levels will be exceeded .
( d ) When dynamic testing is not required , the Engineer may direct that a pile be restruck with the same hammer and cushion system used for the initial driving .
Pile restrike shall be at least 24 hours after initial driving .
A cold hammer shall not be used for the restrike .
The hammer shall be warmed up prior to restrike by striking at least 20 blows on a pile that is at least 25 feet from the pile to be restruck .
The maximum amount of penetration required during restrike shall be 6 inches or the maximum total number of hammer blows shall be 50 , whichever occurs ﬁrst .
462 403.08 ( e ) At the Contractor ’ s option , piles reaching the driving resistance required for nominal pile resistance with heads above the cutoff grade may be driven to the cutoff grade provided driving is less than practical refusal and no damage to the piles occur .

This speciﬁcation implements the provisions and requirements of 23 CFR , Part 230 , Subpart A , Appendix B .
518.02—Procedures The Contractor shall provide each trainee with a copy of the speciﬁc training program and a certiﬁcate showing the type and duration of training satisfactorily completed upon completion of the training pro- gram .
The Contractor shall maintain records and furnish periodic reports to the Engineer documenting compliance with the requirements herein .
( a ) Number of Trainees : The number of trainees for each contract shall be as speciﬁed in the Contract .
The number of trainees is determined by the District Civil Rights Manager ( DCRM ) .
If the Contractor sublets a portion of the Contract , the Contractor shall determine how many trainees are to be trained by the subcontractor .
The Contractor shall retain the primary respon- sibility for conforming to the training requirements imposed by this speciﬁcation .
The Con- tractor shall ensure that these same training requirements are included and made applicable to the subcontract .
Where feasible , 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their ﬁrst year of apprenticeship or training .
( b ) Distribution of Trainees : The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work classiﬁ- cations on the basis of the Contractor ’ s needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classiﬁcations within a reasonable area of recruitment .
The Contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by the Contractor or approved subcontractors under the Contract who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program .
The enrollment of minorities , women , and other disadvantaged persons is approved and moni- tored by the DCRM .
Trainees will be enrolled and approved by the DCRM on Form C-65 prior to the start of training .
( c ) Minorities and Women : Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen status are primary objectives under this program .
The Contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority and women trainees by conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women trainees to the extent such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment .
The Contractor shall demonstrate the steps taken in pursuit thereof prior to a determination as to whether or not the Contractor is in compliance with the requirements herein .
This training commitment shall not be used to discriminate against any applicant for training , whether a member of a minority group or not .
( d ) Use of Journeymen : No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classiﬁcation in which the person has successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status or has been employed as a journeyman .
The Contractor shall satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions on the employee application or by other suitable means .
The Contractor ’ s records shall document the ﬁndings in each case .
733 518.03 ( e ) Length and Type of Training : The minimum length and type of training for each classiﬁcation shall be established in the training program selected by the Contractor and approved by the DCRM .
The DCRM will approve a program if it is reasonably calculated and designed to meet the EEO obligations of the Contractor and qualify the average trainee for journeymen status in the indicated classiﬁcation by the end of the training period .
Apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor , Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training , or with a state apprenticeship program ( Virginia Department of Labor & Industry ) recognized by the U.S. De- partment of Labor , Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training , will also be considered acceptable in meeting the trainee contract goal provided they are being administered in a manner consistent with the EEO obligations of the Contract .
Approval of a training program shall be obtained from the DCRM prior to the commencement of work in the classiﬁcation covered by the program .
Training shall be provided in the construction trade classiﬁcations indicated in the On the Job Training ( OJT ) Manual for Standard Pre-Approved Job Classiﬁcations .
The Contractor shall provide all training on state or federally funded projects of the Department .
( f ) Commencement of Training : It is normally expected that a trainee will begin training on the project as soon as is feasible after the start of the work that requires the skill involved and will remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in the work classiﬁcation or until the trainee has completed the training program .
It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire duration of the contract .
The number trained will be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled under the contract for the entire contract period .
( g ) Payment to Trainees : Trainees shall be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate prevailing minimum journeyman ’ s rate for the ﬁrst half of the training period , 75 percent for the third quarter of the training period , and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period unless apprentices in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on the project .
In such cases , the appropriate rates approved by the DCRM in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classiﬁcation who are covered by these requirements .
( h ) Failure to Provide Required Training : The Contractor ’ s failure to provide the required training damages the effectiveness and integrity of this Afﬁrmative Action Program and circumvents the Department ’ s federal mandate to bring women and minorities into the highway construction industry .
Therefore , if the Contractor has failed by the end of the project to meet the required trainee contract goal , the Contractor shall submit written good faith documentation indicating the reasons the trainee goal was not attained .
This documentation shall be submitted to the DCRM , and should it be determined insufﬁcient , the lack of commitment to this Afﬁrmative Action Program will be relayed to the Engineer for inclusion in the Contractor ’ s Performance Evaluation Report for the project .
Efforts taken by a Contractor that result in the OJT contract goal being exceeded will be recog- nized for the Contractor ’ s support of the Department ’ s commitment to assuring skill improve- ment opportunities for minorities and women in highway construction .
To exceed an OJT goal is to enroll and graduate more trainees than the number speciﬁed in the contract .
518.03—Measurement and Payment The Contractor will be paid $ 3.00 per hour for each employee who is trained in accordance with the approved training program , except as otherwise noted hereinafter .
The DCRM can request approval by the Engineer that 734 518.03 a Contractor be paid for training persons in excess of the trainee contract goal speciﬁed or for trainees enrolled on a contract without a trainee goal .
If approved , this payment will be made even though the Contractor re- ceived additional training program funds from other sources provided such other sources do not speciﬁcally prohibit the Contractor from receiving other payments .
The Department will pay the Contractor stipend $ 3.00 per training hour for training occurring on state or federally funded Department projects .
The Contractor will be credited for each apprentice/trainee employed on the project and will be reim- bursed on the basis of hours worked listed on certiﬁed payrolls and the weekly submittal of trainee Form C-67 .
This form will serve as a record of trainee hours completed under the Contract .
If , in the judgment of the Contractor , Engineer , and DCRM , a trainee becomes proﬁcient enough to qualify as a journeyman before the end of the prescribed training program and the Contractor so employs the trainee , full credit will be given toward the attainment of the trainee goal ; however , the Contractor will be paid only for the actual trainee hours completed .
The Department will pay the Contractor for only those training hours completed if the trainee does not complete training due to lay-off , termination , or resignation .
No payment will be made to the Contractor should the required training not be provided or the trainee is not hired as a journeyman and there is evidence of a lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor in complying with the requirements speciﬁed herein .

Sound barrier walls subject to lateral earth pressure shall have those portions so loaded , designed in accordance with the aforementioned AASHTO speciﬁcations .
In all cases , settlement shall also be considered .
2 .
Unless speciﬁed otherwise , this paragraph governs the selection of wind pressure coefﬁcients in Virginia .
Any sound barrier wall ( structure or ground mounted ) to be con- structed within one half mile of the shore of the Chesapeake Bay or the Atlantic Ocean shall be designed for exposure category D. All other ground-mounted sound barrier walls shall be designed for exposure category B2 , and all other structure-mounted sound barrier walls shall be designed for exposure category C. The wind pressure to be applied to the full height of the wall shall be based on the height to the centroid of the loaded area .
For structure-mounted walls , this height shall be measured from the surface of the feature over which the bridge or structure crosses ( e.g .
mean sea level of the Chesapeake Bay , normal water level at stream crossings , roadway surface on the low shoulder at highway intersections ) or in the case of sound barrier walls mounted on retaining walls , measured from the prevailing ground elevation in the vicinity of the sound barrier wall .

6 .
Anchor rod performance shall be evaluated against the net area of the anchor rod after reduction to account for threads .
Anchor rods shall be checked against the effect of 736 519.01 combined stresses in accordance with the following formula ( found in the 2013 AASHTO Standard Speciﬁcation for Structural Supports for Highway Signs , Luminaires , and Trafﬁc Signals ) : ( fv ) 2 + ( ft ) 2 ≤ 1.0 Fv Ft Where : Ft is the allowable normal stress on the rod , 0.5 x Fy ft is the predicted normal stress on the rod due to direct compression or tension and bending : ft = fa + fb where : fa is the predicted stress on the rod due to direct compression or tension fb is the predicted stress on the rod due to bending about the rod ’ s neutral axis fb shall be included in the computation of ft whenever the clearance between the bottom of the leveling nuts and the top of the concrete foundation is greater than or equal to the diameter of the rod Fv is the allowable stress on the rod due to direct shear , 0.3 x Fy fv is the predicted stress on the rod due to direct shear Note : All stresses are based on the applied load acting on the net area after consideration for the reduction due to the presence of the threads .
e.g .
Net Area = 0.7854 ( D – 0.9743 ) 2 and Sx = 0.0982 ( D – 0.9743 ) 3 n n where “ D ” is the diameter of the rod in inches and “ n ” is the number of threads per inch .
No mortar , grout or concrete shall be placed between the bottom of the base plate and the top of the concrete .
7 .

Total ver- tical deﬂection of the caisson head , from settlement and elastic shorting of the caisson , is limited to one ( 1 ) inch under service axial design loads .
737 519.01 The minimum area of longitudinal reinforcement for caisson type foundations shall be one percent of the gross area of the foundation section .
In caissons where the wall post/ beam is embedded to the bottom of the caisson , no reinforcement is required .
The required allowable stresses for steel and concrete in the caisson may be modiﬁed by the allowable overstress permitted in the wind load condition .
9 .
The Brom ’ s method may be used for the design of laterally loaded caissons less than twenty ( 20 ) feet in length .
For Group II and Group IV , where wind is a contributing load , a minimum safety factor of 2.25 shall be used if soil parameters are based on the results of standard penetration tests .
When parameters are based on the results of subsurface exploration and laboratory testing programs as detailed in the current AASHTO Standard Speciﬁcations for Highway Bridges , or are set by the Department , a safety factor of 2.0 may be used .
The preferred method of analyses for the design of laterally loaded caissons is the “ p-y curve ” method for the design and analysis of caissons under lateral loads , using public domain computer program such as COM624P or commercially available software .
The caisson embedment shall provide a length where the second point of zero deﬂection is reached .
The second point of zero deﬂection may be assumed to be the point on the deﬂec- tion curve where the deﬂection is decreasing and becomes less than 0.02 inch .
The total horizontal deﬂection at the head of the caisson is limited to 0.5 inch .
Temporary casing may be used to stabilize a drill hole ; however , the Contractor shall re- move the temporary casing immediately prior to or while placing the concrete .
If the drill hole can not be maintained , the Contractor shall employ other methods of stabilizing the excavation such as wet hole construction with slurry .
If , at the time of placing concrete , water in the hole exceeds ﬁve ( 5 ) feet or 20 % of the caisson length , whichever is greater , the Contractor shall install the concrete by pump or tremie .
