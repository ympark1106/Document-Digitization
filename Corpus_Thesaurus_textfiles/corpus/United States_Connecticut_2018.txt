It is the responsibility of each bidder and all other interested parties to obtain all bidding related information and documents from the Department of Administrative Services ( DAS ) State Contracting Portal .
Connecticut Department of Transportation bidding and other information and documents which are obtained from any other source must not be submitted to the Department .
Reproduced , reformatted or altered forms of documents are not authorized or acceptable .
For information about the bidding and award of Department construction contracts , consult the “ State of Connecticut Department of Transportation Construction Contract Bidding and Award Manual , ” available from the Division of Contracts and at the following link : Construction Contract Bidding and Award Manual .
In order to be eligible for award of a Department construction contract , a bidder must follow the requirements of this Bid Manual , and all bidding and award matters regarding Department construction contracts shall be governed by the terms of the Bid Manual , unless treated otherwise in the Contract , including these Specifications .
1.02.02—Vacant 1.02.03—Interpretation of Estimate : The quantities shown on the proposal form are approximate only and are given as a basis for the pricing upon which the award of the Contract will be made .
The Department does not warrant that these quantities shall remain unchanged in the actual construction , and the Contractor may not plead misunderstanding or deception because of any variation between estimated and final quantities .
The Engineer reserves the right to increase or decrease any or all of the quantities shown on the proposal form as may be necessary to properly complete the Project .
14 1.02.04 The Department will pay for the actual quantity of authorized and accepted work done or material furnished under each of the items .
1.02.04—Examination of Plans , Specifications , Special Provisions and Site of Work : The bidder is required to examine carefully the site of the Contract work and the proposal form , plans , special provisions , specifications , supplemental specifications , Contract form and other Contract documents for the work contemplated , as well as any permits or permit applications that are likely to affect the Contract work .
The bidder must judge for itself and satisfy itself as to the conditions to be encountered ; the character , quality and quantities of the work to be performed ; the materials to be furnished ; and the requirements of the above documents , particularly the requirements under each Contract item , under the general cost of the work , or under other applicable , but more general , provisions , of the Contract .
The subsurface information furnished in the Contract is based on the interpretation , by the Department , of investigations made only at the specific locations indicated ; and the Department gives no assurance that the conditions discovered are typical of the conditions at other Project site locations or that those conditions will have remained unchanged since the field data were obtained .
The Department also gives no assurance that the presence or absence of subsurface water at the time and locations of these explorations will be representative of actual conditions at the time of construction .
Such subsurface information as was obtained by the Department for its use in the design of the Project will be available for inspection by bidders through the Division of Contracts .
Also , bidders may arrange through the Division of Contracts an opportunity to examine , in advance of bidding , at a location to be specified by the Department , any available samples of the materials encountered in the Department ’ s subsurface explorations .
The Contractor shall be solely responsible for all assumptions , deductions , or conclusions it may make or derive from its examination of any Department subsurface information , document or sample .
In furnishing or making available such information , the Department makes no warranty or representation as to the actual conditions that may be encountered or actual quantities or distribution of quantities of work that will be required in the course of the Project .
The Department does not intend or warrant that plan sheets furnished to the State by utility companies whose facilities may be affected by the proposed construction will show all proposed utility work that will be done by utility companies or municipal authorities or both before , during , or after the life of this Contract .
In addition to the work indicated on such plan sheets , the utility companies and authorities may make adjustments to or remove certain of their installations other than those indicated on the plans , or may install facilities not so indicated .
Bidders must inform the Department in writing , at the earliest opportunity , of any and all omissions , errors , or discrepancies that the bidder discovers within or among the plans , specifications , and bidding documents .
Information and inquiries concerning such matters , and any other information or inquiry concerning the conditions of bidding or award or the interpretation of contract documents , must be transmitted in writing to the Manager of Contracts , Connecticut Department of Transportation , P. O .
Box 317546 , Newington , Connecticut 06131-7546 .
The Department can not ensure a response to inquiries received later than 10 days prior to the scheduled opening of the related bid .
When the Department deems it warranted , responses to such inquiries that relate to 15 1.02.13 changes in or interpretations of the Project documents ( plans and specifications ) will be issued to all bidders in the form of addenda and made a part of the Contract .
Bidders are responsible for ensuring that they are aware of all addenda .
Failure by the Department or postal or other courier services to deliver addenda or other information regarding a Contract being bid does not release the bidder from any obligations under said addenda or the conditions of the bid .
1.02.05—Vacant 1.02.06—Vacant 1.02.07—Vacant 1.02.08—Vacant 1.02.09—Vacant 1.02.10—Vacant 1.02.11—Vacant 1.02.12—Vacant 1.02.13—Knowledge of Applicable Laws : Bidders shall be deemed to know and understand all federal , state and local laws , ordinances and regulations and municipal bylaws which in any manner apply to projects for which they bid ; such legal requirements shall include , but not necessarily be limited to , those which apply to the conduct of the Contract work , the equipment and materials to be used on the Project , or the treatment of individuals or classes of individuals in relationship to their involvement with the Project .
A Contractor ’ s ignorance of such requirements shall not , in any internal Department proceeding or in any claims or other legal proceeding , constitute justification for the Contractor ’ s failure to consider such requirements in formulating a bid proposal , or for the Contractor ’ s failure to ensure that such legal requirements are met with regard to any Department project in which that Contractor participates .
The Contractor agrees that if it should be awarded the contract for any project supported at least in part by federal funding , the Contractor will not knowingly enter into any lower- tier transaction on that project with a person ( including entities ) who , by virtue of federal law or regulation , or by voluntary agreement , is currently ineligible to participate in such a project , unless after disclosure of such ineligibility , such participation is authorized by appropriate federal and State authorities .
The Department expects the Contractor to obey municipal laws and regulations and cooperate with municipal officials .
In some instances , however , municipal laws or regulations , or the orders of municipal officials , may conflict with necessary Project activities .
In most such cases , the municipality does not have the legal power to enforce its laws and regulations upon the State or upon a State project .
This is because the State is protected by its sovereign immunity .
If local police or other authorities should attempt to stop the Contractor from carrying out activities that are necessary in order for the Contractor to comply with Contract requirements , the Contractor should politely inform the municipal authorities that they probably do not have jurisdiction over the State ’ s project , and the Contractor should immediately inform the Engineer of the attempted interference with Project activities .
If the municipal authorities continue to insist upon preventing the Contractor from carrying out Project activities , the Contractor should not 16 1.02.14 defy the authorities , but , to the extent possible , should await directions from the Engineer .

January 2017 SECTION 1.04 SCOPE OF WORK 1.04.01—Intent of Contract 1.04.02—Changes in Quantities of Pay Items , Including Elimination of Such Items 1.04.03—Changes in Quantities and Significant Changes in the Character of Work 1.04.04—Differing Site Conditions 1.04.05—Extra Work 1.04.06—Removal and Disposal of Structures on the Work Site 1.04.07—Rights in and Use of Materials Found on the Work Site 1.04.01—Intent of Contract : The Contract directs and obliges the Contractor to perform the Project described in strict compliance with the Contract terms , including its specifications , plans , special provisions , and other Contract documents .
If the Engineer revises any of those terms in writing during the life of the Contract , the Contractor must comply with said revised terms .
Among other things , the Contract obliges the Contractor to perform all Project work in conformity with the lines , grades , typical cross-sections , dimensions , and other data shown on the plans and other Contract documents .
The Department will pay the Contractor only for work ( including materials necessary for that work , whether or not they are incorporated into that work ) that the Contractor has actually performed under a Contract pay item , and only if the Engineer has accepted said work .
( See 1.02.03 herein . )
( The Contract as it existed when first duly executed by the Engineer is sometimes referred to herein as “ the original Contract. ” ) 1.04.02—Changes in Quantities of Pay Items , Including Elimination of Such Items : The quantities given in the original Contract for Contract pay items are only estimated of the quantities of those items that may be required for Project completion .
( The quantities for given pay items in the original Contract are sometimes referred to herein as the “ estimated quantities ” or “ original quantities. ” ) A change in the original quantity of a Contract pay item ( whether an increase or decrease of the quantity ) shall be deemed to have occurred when the Engineer explicitly orders said change of quantity or when the change of quantity has been necessitated by a construction order or other written direction issued by the Engineer to the Contractor .
A Contract pay item shall be deemed a Major Item if the item ’ s lump sum price in the original Contract , or its original quantity multiplied by its unit price in the original Contract , is equal to or greater than 10 % of the original Contract ’ s total bid price .
All other Contract items shall be deemed Minor Items .
The provisions of 1.04.03 herein shall govern changes in compensation related to a “ significant change ” in Contract work ( as such changes are defined in 1.04.03 ) necessitated by a written order of the Engineer .
The provisions of 1.04.04 herein shall govern changes in compensation related to any differing site condition encountered by the Contractor that affects its performance of Contract work .
The provisions of 1.04.03 and 1.04.04 shall govern in any case in which they conflict with another provision of the Contract .
If the Engineer and the Contractor together determine that a particular change in compensation to the Contractor should be made due to a change in a Contract pay item quantity ( including an item ’ s complete elimination ) , they may make that change in compensation by a written agreement to do so .
22 1.04.03 Rev .
January 2017 ( a ) Quantity Increases of More Than 25 % over Original Quantity : If the actual quantity of work authorized and accepted by the Engineer under a Contract pay item exceeds the item ’ s original quantity by 25 % , the Department will pay for the quantity in excess of 125 % of the original quantity in one of the following three ways .
( One-time fixed costs for which the Department has already reimbursed the Contractor in paying for 125 % of the original quantity shall not be included in a calculation of the actual cost of the excess units . )
( 1 ) Pay for the aggregate excess units on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.09.04 .
( 2 ) Adjust the unit price by the increase or decrease in the unit price for the excess units , which shall be the difference between the original Contract unit price and the actual unit cost ( calculated on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.09.04 ) of the excess units , said difference to be calculated as of the time when work under the item was completed .
( 3 ) Pay for the units in any other manner agreed on in writing by the Engineer and the Contractor .
If , however , the aggregate payment for the units in excess of 125 % is less than $ 25,000 ( using the original Contract unit price for the calculation ) the Engineer will not adjust that unit price .
( b ) Quantity Decreases of More Than 25 % below Original Quantity : If the actual quantity of a Contract pay item authorized and accepted by the Engineer is less than 75 % of the original quantity , the Engineer will not adjust the original Contract unit price for said item unless the Contractor makes a written request to the Engineer for such an adjustment and the Engineer grants it in writing .
If the Engineer grants such a request , the Engineer will adjust the price for each accepted unit of said item performed or provided in one of the following three ways : ( 1 ) Pay for the total item units actually performed or provided in the aggregate units on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.09.04 .
( 2 ) Adjust the unit price by any increase in the unit price for the deficit units , which shall be the difference between the original Contract unit price and the actual unit cost ( calculated on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.09.04 ) of the total units performed or provided , said difference to be calculated as of the time when work under the item was completed .
( 3 ) Pay for the item units performed or provided in any manner agreed on in writing by the Engineer and the Contractor .
In no instance however , shall the unit price paid for the number of units performed or provided , when their quantity has been decreased by more than 25 % of the original quantity , be less than their original unit price ; and in no instance shall the aggregate payment for such a decreased quantity of items be more than the Engineer would have paid for the performance or provision of 75 % of the original quantity at the original unit price .
Regarding treatment of eliminated Contract items , refer to 1.09.05 herein .
1.04.03—Changes in Quantities and Significant Changes in the Character of Work : ( i ) The Engineer reserves the right to make , in writing , at any time during the work , such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project .
Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the surety , and the Contractor agrees to 23 1.04.05 Rev .
January 2017 perform the work as altered .
( ii ) If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the Contract , whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work causes such other work to become significantly different in character , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made to the contract .
The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work .
If a basis can not be agreed upon , then an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable .
( iii ) If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the Contract , the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the Contract .
( iv ) The term “ significant change ” shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances : ( A ) When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction or ( B ) When a Major Item of work , as defined elsewhere in the Contract , is increased in excess of 125 % or decreased below 75 % of the original Contract quantity .
Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 % of original Contract item quantity , or in case of a decrease below 75 % , to the actual amount of work performed .
1.04.04—Differing Site Conditions : ( i ) During the progress of the work , if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the Site differing materially from those indicated in the Contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature , differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the Contract , are encountered at the Site , the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before the Site is disturbed and before the affected work is performed .
( ii ) Upon written notification , the Engineer will investigate the conditions , and if it is determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the Contract , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
( iii ) No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
( iv ) No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any effects caused on unchanged work .
1.04.05—Extra Work : Unforeseen work made necessary by the Engineer ’ s changes of the Contract plans or specifications , or work that is necessary for completion of the Project , but for which no price is provided in the Contract , shall be done in accordance with the requirements of the specifications and as directed by the Engineer .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the necessity for such extra work , stipulating its character and extent , and will notify the Contractor as to whether the Engineer wants the Contractor 24 1.04.06 Rev .
January 2017 to propose a unit price or , lump sum price , or to perform the extra work on a cost-plus basis in accordance with 1.09.04 .
The Engineer need not solicit any price for the extra work from the Contractor , but may , in any event , simply order the Contractor to perform the extra work on a cost-plus basis .
If the Engineer does solicit from the Contractor a unit or lump sum price for the extra work , the Contractor must propose such a price in writing within 5 days of the Engineer ’ s request for one .
The Contractor ’ s price proposal shall be itemized and reasonably detailed , and shall include all known or anticipated direct and indirect costs of the work , including but not limited to , the costs of all safety and other equipment , small tools , labor , subcontractor quotes , consumables , field office overhead , home office overhead , insurance , bonding , and profit .
The character and extent of the extra work , together with the basis of compensation , shall be communicated to the Contractor by means of a construction order which , when signed by the Engineer , shall become a part of the Contract .
If a Contractor objects to any portion of a construction order submitted to it , the Contractor must , within 15 days of its receipt of said order , return the order with a letter to the Department ’ s Assistant District Engineer administering the Contract , describing specifically what portions of the order the Contractor finds objectionable , the nature of its objections , and the bases for its objections .
If the Contractor does not do so , it shall be deemed to have accepted the terms of the construction order .
If the Engineer changes the scope of Contract work , the Contractor shall submit a proposed revised schedule and a cost revision proposal , which takes all such changes into account , if the Contractor believes that such revisions are warranted .
If the schedule is to be revised , it will be revised in accordance with 1.08.08 .
1.04.06—Removal and Disposal of Structures on the Work Site : All structures on the Project site which are not to remain on the Project site after completion of the Project shall be removed from said site and disposed of by the Contractor once it is no longer needed for the Project , and any such structure shall then become the property of the Contractor , except as otherwise required or provided by 1.10.07 .
1.04.07—Rights in and Use of Materials Found on the Work Site : Upon written request of the Contractor and with the written approval of the Engineer , subject to limitations which may be set forth within such approval , any stone , gravel , sand , topsoil or any material from existing bridge substructures , buildings , or other structures , found within the limits of the Project may be excavated or removed and used by the Contractor on the Project , provided that said materials meet the requirements of the specification for such materials .
Any materials excavated or removed shall not be taken off the Project site unless the Engineer in writing specifically authorizes such action .
The following conditions shall govern these matters : 1 .
Excavation or removal of materials that would necessarily be excavated or removed in making the improvement will be paid for at the applicable Contract unit prices ; and , in addition , the item for which this material is used will also be paid for at its Contract unit price .
The Contractor will not be charged for such materials .
The Contractor shall , without compensation , place in the embankment or elsewhere , as appropriate , sufficient suitable material to fill the space that the excavated materials would have occupied , unless otherwise directed by the Engineer .
25 1.04.07 2 .

The Contractor ’ s representative must have full authority to promptly execute and carry out the orders and directions of the Engineer within the terms of the Contract , and to supply such materials , equipment , tools , labor and incidentals as may be required by the Contract or by the Engineer .
Voluntary Partnering : The Connecticut Department of Transportation ( “ Department ” ) wants to establish a cohesive partnership with the Contractor and its principal subcontractors on the Project , so that the partnership can draw on the strengths of each organization in order to identify and pursue the partners ’ mutual Project goals .
Chief among those will be the effective and efficient completion of the Project , within budget , on schedule , and in accordance with applicable plans , specifications , and other Contract provisions .
If the Contractor believes at any point before or during Project construction that the creation of formal partnering between itself and the Department , with the use of a third-party facilitator , would help the Contractor and the Department ( “ Partners ” ) to reach these goals , the Contractor may submit a written request to the District Engineer of the District in which the Project will be constructed for the establishment of formal partnering between the Parties .
If the Contractor makes such a request , the Department will engage in that partnering .
Any costs incurred by the Partners jointly in connection with Project partnering activities , to the extent that those costs are recognized as legitimate and appropriate by both Partners , will be shared equally between them .
Any other costs incurred because of partnering activities will be borne by the Partner that incurred them .
If the Contractor and the Department decide to pursue a formal partnering initiative , they Contractor and The Department will arrange first to meet in order to select a third- party partnering facilitator and to plan a partnering development and team-building workshop .
After they agree upon the services to be performed by the facilitator and the range of compensation for the facilitator that would be acceptable to them , the Contractor will contract accordingly for the services of said facilitator .
The Department will reimburse the Contractor for 50 % of the payments made under that contract , so long as the activities paid for were appropriate and within the contemplation of the Partners .
At the Partners ’ initial partnering meeting , the Partners will also determine who should 32 1.05.06 attend the first partnering workshop , what the workshop ’ s agenda will be , how long the workshop should last , and when and where it will be held .
Unless the Partners agree otherwise , attendance at the first partnering workshop will be mandatory for the Department ’ s District Engineer for the Project and the Department ’ s other key Project personnel , the Contractor ’ s on-Site Project manager and other key supervisory Project personnel , and , if the Contractor agrees to it , the key supervisory personnel of the Contractor ’ s principal Project subcontractors .
The Partners will also request that the Project design engineers and key local government personnel send Regional/District and Corporate/State-level managers to the workshop and direct them to participate in Project partnering activities as and when requested to do so by the Partners .
With the agreement of the Partners , follow-up Project partnering workshops will be held periodically until the Department closes out the Contract .
If the Partners agree on a formal partnering charter for the Project , the establishment of that charter will not change the legal relationship of the Partners to the Contract ; it will not alter , supplement , or eliminate any of the Partners ’ rights or obligations under the Contract .
1.05.06—Cooperation with Utilities ( Including Railroads ) : The Engineer may anticipate that a Project construction activity will require the removal , repair , replacement or relocation of a utility appurtenance .
In such an instance , the Engineer , in advance of the commencement of such activity , will notify the affected utilities , either directly or through the local government , of the anticipated nature and timing of said activity .

Payment for work that has been performed by a subcontractor does not eliminate the Contractor ’ s responsibilities for all the work as defined in 1.07.12 , “ Contractor ’ s Responsibility for Work. ” Payment for work that has been performed by a subcontractor also does not release the subcontractor from its responsibility for maintenance and other periods of subcontractor responsibility specified for the subcontractor ’ s items of work .
Failure of a subcontractor to meet its maintenance , warranty or defective work responsibilities may result in administrative action on future Department contracts .
For any dispute regarding prompt payment , the alternate dispute resolution provisions of this article shall apply .
The above requirements are also applicable to all sub-tier subcontractors and the above provisions shall be made a part of all subcontract agreements .
Failure of the Contractor to comply with the provisions of this Section may result in a finding that the Contractor is nonresponsible as a bidder for a Department contract .
1.08.02—Establishment of Construction Field Office : Prior to the start of Project construction , and within 10 calendar days after the signing of the Contract by the parties , the Contractor shall propose in writing to the Engineer a field office location .
The proposal shall include the office telephone number to be used , the nearest utility pole number , and the distance from that pole to the proposed field office .
The office shall be made acceptable to the Engineer and available for use , including all utility hookups , local permits and inspections , within 30 days of the Engineer ’ s order to establish the office .
Such order shall not be deemed the “ Notice to Proceed. ” 1.08.03—Prosecution of Work : The Contractor shall commence construction operations with that part of the Project designated for such commencement in the progress schedule which it has submitted to the Department , unless the Engineer directs the Contractor to commence with a different part of the Project .
The work shall be conducted in such manner and with sufficient materials , equipment and labor as are necessary to ensure completion of the Project in accordance with the Contract within the time set forth in the Contract .
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer of its intention to commence or recommence any Project operation at least 48 hours in advance of doing so .
The Contractor shall also give the Engineer such advance notice of any intent to discontinue any Project operation , unless emergency conditions make it impracticable to give such notice so far in advance .
The Engineer retains the right to disallow such commencement , recommencement or discontinuance of operations .
1.08.04—Limitation of Operations : The Contractor shall plan and perform the Project work in such a manner and in such sequence as will cause as little interference as is practicable with vehicular , railroad , aircraft , pedestrian or other traffic .
The Contractor shall cooperate with any utilities involved in or affected by the Project operations , and shall schedule its operations in accordance with 1.05.06 .
58 1.08.05 The Contractor shall give the Engineer 7 days ’ advance written notice of any proposed changes in Project activities that will alter vehicular traffic patterns , causing lane shifts , detours , temporary closure of a lane , permanent closure of a lane or lane reductions , or any other alteration of railroad , aircraft , pedestrian or other traffic patterns affecting usage of such a transportation facility by the traveling public .
This advance notification will allow the Department to publish news releases and provide public radio announcements to inform the public of revised traffic patterns or possible traffic delays .
Failure of the Contractor to provide such timely notice will subject the Contractor to stop work orders until such time as the 7 days of required notice have run from either the Contractor ’ s giving of the relevant notice or the Department ’ s discovery of the pertinent alteration of traffic conditions .
1.08.05—Personnel and Equipment : The Contractor shall assign to the Project only personnel who are careful and competent .
The Engineer may demand the removal of any person employed by the Contractor on the Project who is , in the opinion of the Engineer , guilty of misconduct on a Department project or incompetent or negligent in the performance of his duties on a Department project or any portion thereof , or who neglects or refuses to comply with directions given by the Engineer in connection with the Project .
Following such a demand for his removal , such person shall not work again on the Project without the prior written consent of the Engineer .
Should the Contractor , following such a demand for removal , continue to employ or again employ such person on any Department project without the required consent of the Engineer , the Commissioner may withhold all estimated payments that are or may become due to the Contractor for the Project , or the Engineer may shut down the Project until the Contractor has complied with the Engineer ’ s orders concerning that person .
The use of convict labor on projects funded in whole or in part by the federal government is prohibited .
The Contractor shall furnish whatever equipment is necessary for the Project to be performed in a manner and at a rate of progress that is acceptable to the Engineer .
Equipment used on any portion of the Project shall not be used in any way that may cause injury to the roadway , adjacent property , or other property on or adjacent to the Project site , unless such damage is allowed by the Engineer for the performance of the Project .
The Contractor may submit to the Engineer a request to use equipment or methods other than those specified in the Contract .
If the Engineer so directs , there shall be a trial of such equipment or methods .
If the results of the trial are satisfactory to the Engineer , the Contractor may begin using the proposed equipment or method on the Project .
Failure of the equipment or method to meet the specified Contract performance standards in the course of the specified trial , or , in the absence of such standards , a failure to perform to the satisfaction of the Engineer , shall be cause for rejection of any such method or equipment , and any work performed with either .
Such rejected equipment or work shall be removed immediately from the Project site .
1.08.06—Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer : The Engineer may suspend the Project wholly or in part , for such period or periods as he considers to be in the best interests of the State , including , but not limited to , the interests of public necessity , convenience , or safety .
During such periods of suspension , and subject to any related directions from the Engineer , the Contractor shall store all materials and equipment in a way that will keep 59 1.08.07 them from obstructing or impeding the traveling public unnecessarily , and that will keep the materials from being damaged ; shall take all reasonable measures to prevent damage to the work performed ; shall provide suitable drainage of the roadway and Project site by opening ditches , shoulder drains , etc. , as appropriate ; and shall erect temporary structures to prevent damage to the Project or to other property , and to protect the public , where and when necessary .
The Contractor shall maintain the Project site and all roadways and buildings thereon in a condition safe for travel or occupancy , and shall maintain all required barricades , signs , and lights during the period of suspension : ( 1 ) If the Engineer orders in writing that performance of all or any portion of the Project shall be suspended , or that it shall be delayed for an unreasonable period of time ( not customary , within the scope of possibilities that an experienced contractor should know might occur on a construction project , or inherent in the nature of construction activities ) , and if the Contractor believes that additional compensation or Contract time is due to it as a result of such suspension or delay , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for a related Contract adjustment within 7 calendar days of the Contractor ’ s receipt of a direction from the Engineer to resume work .
The request shall set forth the specific reasons and support for the requested adjustment .
( 2 ) Upon receipt of the Contractor ’ s request , the Engineer will evaluate the request .
If the Engineer agrees that the expenditures or time required for the Contractor ’ s performance of the Contract have increased as a result of such suspension or delay , and if the suspension or delay was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor , its suppliers , or subcontractors at any approved tier , and was not caused by weather , the Engineer will make an appropriate adjustment ( excluding any profit ) of the written terms of the Contract .
The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the determination as to whether or not the requested adjustment of the Contract is warranted and will be made .
( 3 ) No Contract adjustment will be made unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed .
( 4 ) In addition to the other limits and requirements imposed by this article , no Contract adjustment will be allowed under this article to the extent ( a ) that the Project work would have been suspended or delayed by any cause other than the ones identified in the Contractor ’ s request , or ( b ) that the requested adjustment or type of adjustment is provided for or barred by another provision of the Contract .
( With regard to Items 1-4 above , refer to 23 CFR , Section 635.109 , “ Standardized Changed Condition Clauses , ” Required FHWA Contract Specification . )
1.08.07—Determination of Contract Time : Unless the Contract requires the Project completion by a specified date , the number of calendar days allowed for the completion of the Project will be fixed by the Department , will be stated in the Contract , and will be known ( with any subsequent adjustments ) as the “ Contract time. ” If at any time the Contractor submits a schedule showing completion of the work more than 30 calendar days in advance of the Contract completion date , the Department will issue a no-cost construction order revising the allowable Contract time to that shown on the Contractor ’ s schedule .
60 1.08.08 Rev .
January 2017 When the Contract time is stated on a calendar-day basis , that time shall be the number of consecutive calendar days contained in the Contract period designated in the Contract , excluding the time period from each December 1 through the following March 31 ( the “ winter shutdown period ” ) .
The Contract time will begin to run on the date designated in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice to Proceed ” as the date for commencement of the Project , and the time will be computed as herein provided on a consecutive-day basis , including all Saturdays , Sundays , holidays , and non-work days from April 1 through November 30 of each included year .
Time will not be charged for days in the winter shutdown period , except for time used in working on planting projects and any other projects with regard to which the Standard Specifications or Project bid documents provide otherwise .
If the Engineer so approves , the Contractor may work on the Project during the winter shutdown period with no charge being made against the Contract time .
If the time specified for completion of the Project , with time extensions , is due to expire before December 1 of a given year , but the Project has not been completed by that December 1 , the time charged to the Contractor will continue through the winter shutdown period .
The total elapsed time in calendar days , computed as described above , from the commencement date specified in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice to Proceed ” to the “ Substantial Completion ” date specified in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice of Substantial Completion ” shall be considered as the time used in the performance of the Contract work .
Suspension involving cessation of work on all items , except minor construction not affected by or connected with the cause of suspension , shall be considered as total suspension .
In case of a total suspension of the Project ordered by the Engineer , not due to any fault of the Contractor , the elapsed time during which the Project is suspended will not be charged against the Contract time .
Work of an emergency nature ordered by the Engineer for the convenience or safety of the public or the protection of the Project work , if performed during a period of total suspension , will not be charged against Contract time .
No such time allowance will be granted in case of partial suspension ; provided , however , that the Contractor may request and the Engineer may grant permission to perform specific limited operations during such a partial suspension , in which case Contract time chargeable for those operations shall be negotiated and agreed to in writing before such operations may commence .
1.08.08—Extension of Time : The Contractor may present to the Engineer a request in writing for an extension of Contract time if the time necessary for completion of the Project has been increased due to extra or added work or delays resulting from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor , except for weather or seasonal conditions ( unless extraordinary and catastrophic ) .
Such causes include , but are not limited to , natural catastrophes , acts of the State in either its sovereign or contractual capacity , acts of another contractor in the performance of a contract with the State , the presence of utility facilities ( including railroads ) , fires , strikes , floods , or delays by suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or such suppliers .
The Contractor ’ s plea that insufficient Contract time was allowed under the Contract before commencement of the Project is not a valid reason for extending the Contract 61 1.08.08 Rev .
January 2017 time .
Requests for an extension of time with adequate substantiation must be presented within 60 calendar days from the event that is the basis of the request or from the first effect of such an event on the Project .
The Contractor will be responsible for providing all the documentation necessary to support the reasonableness of the additional time requested .
This shall include a Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis and accompanying narrative that includes the specific dates and number of days for which the extension is sought , the basis or bases for the extension , and the schedule analysis illustrated in a graphic representation of the schedule impacts such as a bar chart or other type of graphical schedule .
The critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
Such requests will be considered by the Engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
Requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the Contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time , or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the Contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the Project as to materials , labor , or equipment .
For all Project delays or time increases , except as provided below , additional Contract time is the sole remedy that the Contractor may have , and such periods of additional Contract time shall be deemed “ Non-Compensable Delays. ” For delays caused by the State in its Contractual capacity , the Contractor may , in addition to a time extension , request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay , and such periods of extended Contract time may be deemed “ Compensable Delays. ” The period of compensable delay is limited as follows : ( 1 ) It may not include time more than 60 days prior to the Engineer ’ s receiving written notice from the Contractor , with adequate substantiation , of its intent to claim damages for the delay , and ( 2 ) It may not include periods of delay for which the State was responsible , but during which the Contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the State was not responsible .
Damages for periods of Project delay for which the State had sole responsibility shall be limited to the increased costs incurred by the Contractor ( which shall not include lost profits ) , which the Contractor substantiates and which the Contractor shows were caused by such delays .
If an approved extension of Contract time extends beyond November 30 , the number of days of the approved extension remaining on that date will not begin to run again until the following April 1 .
The Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis shall include at a minimum : 1 .
The manner in which the Contractor planned to construct the Project , in terms of activities , logical interrelationships of activities , work sequences , activity durations , and calendars .
2 .
The actual duration and sequences of the activities , based on what actually occurred on the Project .
3 .
The variances between the planned and actual performance of the work , listed in a chronological and cumulative manner , summing to the net total delay on the Project at the time of the request .
a .
The causes of the variances between the planned and actual performance 62 1.08.09 Rev .
January 2017 & Errata July 2017 of the work , specifically allocating legal responsibility for each to either the Department or the Contractor .
b .
The effects of the variances in work sequences , activity durations , manpower , and resources on the incurred costs of the affected party or parties .
4 .
An identification analysis of the causes of any concurrent delays on the Project .
5 .
Statements as to whether the time extension days sought are compensable or non-compensable , along with a specific statement of any compensation requested in connection with the time extension .
Any request for a time extension that does not include a corresponding request for compensation will be assumed to be a request for a non-compensable time extension .
6 .
All associated analysis documents , worksheets , schedules and contemporaneous documents supporting the Critical Path Method Schedule Delay Analysis .
1.08.09—Failure to Complete Work on Time : Time is an essential element of the Contract .
Since the prosecution of the Project may obstruct traffic , interfere with business , and otherwise inconvenience the public , it is important that the Project be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the Contract , including engineering , inspection and supervision , will also be increased as the time for Project completion is lengthened .
Therefore , for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the Contract time has expired , the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the Contract shall be deducted from any money due to the Contractor .
Liquidated damages are not a penalty , but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .
If the last day of the initial Contract time or the initial Contract date determined for Substantial Completion is before December 1 in the given year , liquidated damages as specified in the Contract shall be assessed against the Contractor per calendar day ( including any days during a winter shutdown period ) from that day until the date on which the Project is substantially completed .
The Engineer has the right to deduct the amount of the liquidated damages assessed against the Contractor from any estimated payment for work performed under the Contract or under any other State contract , or from any other sums owed by the State to the Contractor ; or to claim and recover such sums by process of law .
1.08.10—Termination of Contract for Cause : The Commissioner may give notice in writing to the Contractor and its surety of any delay , neglect , or default of the Contractor which the Commissioner believes has occurred , including one or more of the following : 1 .
Failure to begin the Project on the date specified in the Notice to Proceed .
2 .
Failure to perform the Project with sufficient personnel , equipment or materials to ensure timely Project completion .
3 .
Unsuitable performance of the Project or failure to perform Project work in accordance with the Contract .
4 .
Failure or refusal to remove or correct work rejected by the Engineer .
5 .
Discontinuance of suitable prosecution of the Project for a period of 72 hours , excluding Sundays and holidays , without written authorization to do so from the Engineer .
6 .
Failure to recommence discontinued work within 48 hours ( excluding Sundays and 63 1.08.11 Errata July 2017 holidays ) after being ordered to do so by the Engineer .
7 .
Insolvency , filing for bankruptcy , or any act or occurrence which may render the Contractor financially incapable of completing the Project .
8 .
Failure to satisfy any final judgment for a period of 30 calendar days .
9 .
Making of any assignment for the benefit of creditors .
10 .
Violation of any provisions of the Contract .
11 .
Any other cause which , in the judgment of the Commissioner , warrants termination , including , but not limited to , violations of the antitrust or criminal laws , and attempts to deceive or defraud the Department in material matters .
If the Contractor or surety within a period of 10 calendar days after such notice does not proceed in conformance with the directions set forth in the notification , or fails to present a remedial plan of operation satisfactory to the Commissioner , then the Commissioner may , at his discretion , order the surety to complete the Project or , without violating the Contract , take the right to control and prosecute the Project out of the hands of said Contractor and surety .
No termination of the Contract for such cause will be deemed to have occurred , however , unless the Commissioner himself or herself ( and not merely a designated representative of his or hers ) expressly declares it in a writing to the Contractor .
The Department may acquire or rent whatever materials or equipment are necessary in order to complete the Project and may seize and use for purposes of the Project ( with any appropriate compensation to the Contractor ) any material or equipment that the Contractor acquired or purchased expressly for the Project in accordance with a specific Contract requirement .
The Department may also enter into an agreement , either by negotiation or public letting , for the completion of the Contract according to the terms and provisions thereof , or use such other methods or combinations thereof as in the Commissioner ’ s opinion shall be required or desirable for the completion of the Contract in an acceptable manner .
All costs and charges incurred by the Department , in connection with completing the Project under the Contract , or as a result of the Contractor ’ s default , shall be deducted from any monies due to or which may become due to the Contractor .
In case such expense exceeds the sum which would have been payable under the Contract , then the Contractor and the surety shall be liable for , and shall pay to the State , the amount of the excess .
1.08.11—Final Cleaning Up : The Project will not be considered complete and will not be accepted until the rights of way , borrow pits , and all other ground , both public and private , occupied by the Contractor in connection with the Project has been cleared of all surplus and discarded materials , rubbish and temporary structures .
The Contractor must drain all borrow pits where practicable .
All property , both public and private , which has been damaged during the prosecution of the Project , shall be restored by the Contractor to an appearance and condition acceptable to the Engineer .
All ditches , waterways , drainage structures and culverts constructed under the Contract shall be cleaned and cleared of obstructions by the Contractor , and shall be left in a condition acceptable to the Engineer .
When so directed by the Engineer , the Contractor shall clean all existing ditches , waterways , drainage structures and culverts of obstructions resulting from Project operations .
64 1.08.12 1.08.12—Final Inspection : If the Engineer determines that the work may be substantially complete , a Semi Final Inspection will be held as soon as practical .
After the Semi Final Inspection is held and the Engineer determines that the requirements for Substantial Completion have been satisfied the Engineer will prepare a “ Notice of Substantial Completion. ” When the Contractor has completed all work listed in the “ Notice of Substantial Completion ” the Contractor shall prepare a written notice requesting a Final Inspection and a “ Certificate of Acceptance of Work. ” The Engineer will hold an Inspection of the Project as soon as practical after the Engineer determines that the Project may be completed .
If the Engineer deems the Project complete , said inspection shall constitute the Final Inspection , and the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing that the Final Inspection has been performed .
If the inspection discloses any unsatisfactory or incomplete Project work , the Engineer will notify the Contractor of such deficiencies .
The Contractor shall immediately correct the deficiencies .
Upon such correction , another inspection will be made that shall then constitute the Final Inspection , provided that the work has been satisfactorily completed .
On projects consisting of two or more individual , geographically-separated sections of roadways , sites , or physically-separated buildings or portions of buildings , a partial final inspection of individual , fully-completed sections will be performed by the Engineer if the Contractor so requests .
If at any time during the prosecution of the Project the Contractor substantially completes a unit or portion of the Project , such as , but not limited to , a structure , an interchange , a building , a portion of a site , a branch circuit in highway illumination that has been in satisfactory and continuous operation for a period of at least 30 days , or a section of road or pavement , then , to the extent that said portion ’ s stability and integrity are not dependent upon the completion of other Contract work , the completed unit or portion of the Project may be opened : ( 1 ) to vehicular or pedestrian traffic under the provisions of 1.07.11 ; or ( 2 ) to railroad , aircraft , pedestrian or other traffic , or to occupancy , at the direction of the Engineer .
A final inspection of the substantially-completed unit or portion of the Project will be arranged by the Engineer .
Upon evidence of such completion , including issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for any building , and upon agreement by the Engineer , the Contractor will be relieved of the responsibility for that work which was placed upon it by 1.07.12 .
The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages to the completed unit or portion of the Project that may be caused by or that may result from the operations of the Contractor or its subcontractors , or their employees ; and the Contractor shall take such precautions and shall provide such protection as may be necessary to avoid possible damage to said unit or portion of the Project .
The acceptance of the completed unit or portion shall in no way affect any other requirements governing the completion and acceptance of the Project as a whole .
1.08.13—Termination of the Contractor ’ s Responsibility : The Contractor ’ s responsibility for non-administrative Project work will be considered terminated when the final inspection has been held , any required additional work and final cleaning-up have been completed , all final operation and maintenance manuals have been submitted , and all of the Contractor ’ s equipment and construction signs have been removed from the 65 1.09.02 Project site .
When these requirements have been met to the satisfaction of the Engineer , the Commissioner will accept the work by certifying in writing to the Contractor that the non-administrative Project work has been completed .
1.08.14—Acceptance of Project : The Project will be accepted by the Commissioner when all Project work has been completed , as defined by the requirements of 1.08.13 , and the following have been submitted to the satisfaction of the Engineer : 1 .
Supporting information necessary to substantiate pay quantities , such as cost-plus backup documentation ; 2 .
Reports and forms required on all Federal Aid Projects ; 3 .
Warranties , guaranties , final operation and maintenance manuals , and documentation to the effect that training and start-up support required by the Contract have been completed ; 4 .
Any other documents required by the Contract .
SECTION 1.09 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT 1.09.01—Measurement of Quantities 1.09.02—Value Engineering Change Proposal 1.09.03—Increased or Decreased Quantities 1.09.04—Extra and Cost-Plus Work 1.09.05—Eliminated Items 1.09.06—Partial Payments 1.09.07—Final Payment 1.09.08—Payment of Costs Owed to the State 1.09.01—Measurement of Quantities : Work completed in compliance with the Contract will be measured by the Engineer according to U.S .
Customary standard measures , and quantities of work performed shall be computed based on such measurements made in accordance with the methods of measurement described herein under provisions regarding the applicable Contract item .
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Contract , only work that is within the payment limits prescribed by the Contract or ordered by the Engineer will be measured for payment .
No payment will be made for work that is not actually performed .
Structures shall be measured and quantities computed according to the neat lines shown on the plans ( as those plans may be revised by authorization of the Engineer ) , or as may otherwise be required by the Contract .
Quantities of materials measured for payment by net weight shall be measured in tons , while contained in hauling vehicles on scales furnished by and at the expense of the Contractor .
The scales shall be satisfactory to the Engineer and shall be sealed .
When required by the Engineer , an inspector will be appointed and compensated by the Department to check the weight of all materials to be incorporated into the Project .
The tare weight of trucks used to haul materials being paid for by weight shall be taken at such times as the Engineer directs .
1.09.02—Value Engineering Change Proposal : These Value Engineering Change Proposal ( VECP ) provisions apply as encouragement to the Contractor to initiate , develop , and present to the Department for consideration cost- or time-reduction 66 1.09.02 proposals or a combination of both conceived by the Contractor , involving changes to the drawings , designs , specifications , or other requirements of the Contract .
These provisions do not apply unless the proposal submitted is specifically identified by the Contractor as being presented for consideration as a VECP .
All such proposals must be made on the Department ’ s VECP form , copies of which are available from the Department .
The Department reserves the right to decline to review , or to reject after initial review , any VECP .
Before expending considerable funds in development of a formal VECP , the Contractor shall submit a conceptual Proposal to the Department on Department-provided forms .
The proposals which may be considered as VECPs are those which , if implemented , ( a ) would require modification of the Contract by construction order ; ( b ) would produce a savings to the Department by calling for the use of items or methods less costly than those specified in the Contract ; ( c ) would not alter necessary standardized features of the original Project ; and ( d ) would not impair essential functions or characteristics of the construction called for by the original Contract , such as service life , reliability , economy of operation , and ease of maintenance .
Material substitution alone will not be considered as a VECP .
A VECP may shorten Contract time , however , acceleration alone will not be considered as a VECP .
Cautions and Conditions : 1 .
The Contractor is cautioned not to base any bid or bid price on the anticipated approval of a VECP and to recognize that such Proposal may be rejected .
The Contractor will be required to perform the Contract in accordance with the existing Contract plans and specifications at the prices bid unless and until the Department formally accepts , in writing , the Contractor ’ s VECP .
2 .
In order for the Department to consider such a Proposal , the savings likely to be generated by the Proposal must be sufficient , in the sole judgment of the Department , to warrant its review and processing by the Department .
All costs resulting from such review or processing will be borne by the Department .
Before any VECP will be considered by the Department , the Department must determine , in its sole judgment , that implementation of the Proposal would result in a total cost savings of more than $ 100,000.00 , reflecting a savings of at least $ 50,000.00 for the Department .
The Department will not consider any VECP that would require an increase in Contract time .
3 .
All VECPs apply only to the ongoing Contract , and whether approved or not , such Proposals become the property of the Department .
Such Proposals shall contain no restrictions imposed by the Contractor on their use or disclosure by the State .
The Department will have the right to use , duplicate and disclose in whole or in part any data necessary for the use or implementation of the Proposal .
The Department retains the right to use any accepted Proposal or part thereof on any other current or subsequent Department projects without any obligation to the Contractor for such use .
This provision is not intended to deny rights provided by law with respect to patented materials or processes .
4 .
If the Department already has under consideration certain revisions of the Contract or has approved certain changes in specifications or standard drawings for general use 67 1.09.02 which subsequently appear in a VECP , the Department may reject the Contractor ’ s Proposal and may proceed with such revisions without any obligation to the Contractor .
5 .
The Proposal must be presented and approved in writing prior to the Contractor ’ s undertaking any work on the Contract items involved in the proposal .
Savings due to a reduction in quantities or deletion of items which result solely from adjustments to field conditions , and Proposals which would only waive specification or other Contract requirements , are not considered to be VECPs .
6 .
The Contractor shall have no claim against the Department for any costs or delays due to the Department ’ s review or rejection of a VECP , including , but not limited to , development costs , anticipated profits , or increased material or labor costs resulting from delays in the review or rejection of such Proposal .
7 .
The Department will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a Proposal and of the estimated net savings in construction costs that would result from adoption of all or any part ( s ) of such Proposal .
In determining such estimated net savings , the Department reserves the right to disregard the Contract bid prices if , in the judgment of the Engineer , such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of work to be performed or deleted under the Proposal .
Errors in the estimated quantities in the bid proposal form for the Contract shall be corrected by the Department prior to calculating the savings that would likely result from adoption of the VECP .
8 .
The Engineer may reject all or any portion of work performed pursuant to an approved VECP if the Engineer determines that unsatisfactory results are being obtained because of the Proposal ’ s implementation with regard to that work .
The Engineer may direct the removal of such rejected work and require the Contractor to proceed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
Where modifications of the VECP have been approved in order to adjust to field or other conditions , payment will be limited to the total amount payable for the work at the Contract bid prices , as if the pertinent work had been constructed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
The Contractor waives the right to use such rejection or limitation of reimbursement as the basis of any claim against the State for delay damages or for any other damages or costs .
9 .
VECPs must meet the requirements of the specifications or standards of the Department .
The standards governing the original design of the Contract will be the minimal standard allowed .
10 .
If additional information is needed in order for the Department to evaluate Proposals , the Contractor must provide the Department with this information within 14 calendar days of such request or within such other time period as may be approved by the Department .
Failure to do so will result in rejection of the Proposal .
11 .
The Contractor shall provide revised Project plans , specifications and estimates to the Department in construction order format , reflecting such changes as would be required for implementation of the VECP .
The Contractor shall be solely responsible for any errors or omissions resulting from such revisions .
12 .
Savings not directly related to the Contract , such as , but not limited to , reductions in inspection or testing costs or Department overhead , will not be included in the savings calculation for any VECP .
After the Contractor submits a conceptual Proposal , they will be notified in writing 68 1.09.02 of the acceptability of the conceptual Proposal or the reason ( s ) for its rejection .
The Department retains the right to reject the formal Proposal even if the conceptual Proposal was determined acceptable .
VECPs will be processed in the same manner as are alterations of the Contract that require a construction order .
VECP Submittal Requirements : 1 .
A statement that the Proposal is being submitted as a VECP .
2 .
A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirements and the proposed change ( s ) , and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each , taking into account considerations of service life , economy of operations , ease of maintenance , desired appearance , safety , and environmental impacts or necessary permit changes .
When an item ’ s function or characteristics would be altered by implementation of the Proposal , a justification of the anticipated effects of the alteration on the end item ’ s performance must be included in the Proposal .
A life- cycle cost analysis must be included for items involving alteration of functional characteristics .
Factors for determining future worth will be provided by the Department .
3 .
Complete plans , specifications , and computations signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of Connecticut , showing that the proposed Contract revisions would incorporate the same design criteria and restrictions that applied to the original Contract features and requirements .
Said revisions shall be submitted by the Contractor in the Department ’ s construction order format consisting of 1 paper copy of the plans and 1 electronic copy of the plans as a portable document format ( PDF ) file , indicating ( a ) quantity increases and decreases by item number , with associated cost ; ( b ) new items , with their quantities and costs ; ( c ) specifications in contract format ; and , if needed , ( d ) compliance permit applications and revisions in accordance with 1.10 .
4 .
A complete analysis of the probable cost effects of the proposed changes on Project construction , future operations in connection with the completed Project , maintenance and durability of completed Project construction , and other aspects of the Project , as appropriate .
5 .
The date by which the Proposal would have to be implemented in order for the Department to obtain the maximum cost reduction from the Proposal ’ s implementation .
The period established by the date must allow the Department ample time for review and processing of the Proposal .
Should the Department find that it does not have sufficient time for such review and processing , it may reject the Proposal solely on such basis .
If the Department fails to respond to the Proposal by said date , the Contractor shall consider the Proposal to be rejected and shall have no claims against the State as a result thereof .
6 .
A description of the effect that the implementation of the Proposal would likely have on the time required to complete the Project .
Payment for accepted VECPs : 1 .
The changes resulting from a VECP will be incorporated into the Contract by construction order and shall reflect the changes in existing unit bid item quantities , or any new agreed price items , cost-plus lump sum , or any combination thereof , 69 1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 & Errata July 2017 as appropriate , in accordance with the Specifications and as determined by the Department .
Any lump sum submission shall be accompanied by a schedule of payment values .
2 .
The Contract prices for the revised Project work will be paid directly as accomplished .
In addition to such payment , the Department will pay the Contractor , under a separate item or a Value Engineering Incentive item , 50 % of the total savings obtained by the State as a result of its implementation of the VECP .
An estimate of said savings is to be calculated by the Department within 1 week prior to the Proposal ’ s acceptance , by ( a ) estimating what it will cost the Department to carry out the Project as revised according to the VECP ; ( b ) estimating what it would have cost the Department to carry out the Project under the terms of the Contract as modified by any construction orders as of the time that the Department accepted the Proposal ; and ( c ) subtracting the sum estimated as per ( a ) from the sum estimated as per ( b ) .
When the implementation of the Proposal , including all related construction , has been completed , the Department will calculate the actual savings that resulted from it .
The Department will then distribute half of the actual savings less any previous payments to the Contractor .
3 .
The Contractor ’ s costs for development , design , submission and processing of the VECP are not eligible for reimbursement .
4 .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor based on any cost savings not identified in the VECP prior to its acceptance .
5 .
The cost savings from a VECP that is exclusively time reduction shall be calculated as the number of Contract days reduced multiplied by the amount of liquidated damages for 1 day under the Contract .
1.09.03—Increased or Decreased Quantities : Whenever the quantity of any item as given in both the bid proposal form and Contract is increased or decreased , the Department will pay for such item at the Contract price , on the basis of the actual quantity completed , except as otherwise expressly authorized under the provisions of 1.04.02 , 1.04.03 or 1.04.04 .
1.09.04—Extra and Cost-Plus Work : Extra work shall be performed only under the conditions and subject to the requirements outlined in 1.04.05 .
Payment for extra work may be made on any unit price or lump sum price or other basis to which the Engineer and the Contractor agree in writing , or the Engineer may order that the Contractor will be paid for the work on the cost-plus basis described in this Article .
The following sets forth the components of the cost-plus basis for making payments : ( a ) Labor : ( 1 ) For all labor used by the Contractor for the subject work , the Department will pay the Contractor the wage rate that it actually paid for same , as shown by its certified payroll , which shall be at least the minimum rate established for the Project by the CT Department or the U.S. Department of Labor .
For all foremen in direct charge of Project work , the Department will pay the Contractor the actual wage paid to the foremen as shown on the Contractor ’ s certified payroll .
( 2 ) The Department will reimburse the Contractor for the actual costs paid to , or on 70 1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 behalf of , workers by reason of allowances , health and welfare benefits , pension fund benefits and other such benefits in connection with the subject work , when such amounts are required by a collective bargaining agreement or another employment contract generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the Project .
The Contractor shall certify all such costs in writing to the Engineer .
( 3 ) For property damage , liability and workmen ’ s compensation insurance premiums , unemployment insurance contributions and social security taxes on Project cost- plus work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for its actual Project costs .
The Contractor shall provide documentation to the Engineer , satisfactory in form and substance , of all such costs .
( 4 ) The Department will also pay to the Contractor an amount equal to 20 % ( 15 % for overhead , 5 % for profit ) of the total sums described in ( a ) ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) above .
No part of the salary or expenses of anyone connected with the Contractor ’ s forces above the grade of foreman , who provides general supervision of Project work , will be included in the above payment calculations , except when the Contractor ’ s organization is entirely occupied with cost-plus work , in which case the salary of a superintendent may be included in said labor item when the nature of the pertinent Project work is such that , in the opinion of the Engineer , a superintendent was required for that work .
The Engineer and the Contractor may agree in writing to the allowable rate of pay for such superintendent , or the Engineer may make payment based on such rate as he deems reasonable The Engineer reserves the right to determine the number and type of personnel to be employed for the cost-plus Project work .
( b ) Specialized Work : When the Engineer directs the Contractor to perform specialized work requiring skills , tools and equipment substantially unlike those ordinarily used by the Contractor or its authorized Project subcontractors , the Department will pay the Contractor for the use of a specialist to perform the specialized work .
For such specialized services , including materials incorporated into the Project , the Department will pay the Contractor its actual costs , plus additional compensation in accordance with subparagraph ( e ) below .
If so requested by the Engineer , the Contractor shall obtain and submit to the Engineer , prior to performing such specialized work , a minimum of three price quotes for the work .
( c ) Materials : For all materials necessary for cost-plus Project work , the Department will pay the Contractor its actual cost for such materials , including delivery charges as shown by original receipted bills , plus 15 % of the sum of said cost and charges .
In lieu of receipted bills for materials used for the Project , but which were not specifically purchased for the Project , but rather were taken from the Contractor ’ s stock , the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer an affidavit certifying that such materials were not purchased for the Project , that the materials were taken from the Contractor ’ s stock , that the quantity claimed to have been used on the Project was actually so used , and that the price claimed for the materials reflects their fair market value at the time of their use on the Project .
The Department will pay for costs of transporting the materials to the Project site , in accordance with subparagraphs ( a ) and ( d ) hereof .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor for any penalty or charge incurred by the Contractor due to the Contractor ’ s late or delayed payment for the pertinent materials .
( d ) Equipment : All equipment used for cost-plus Project work must , in the judgment 71 1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 of the Engineer , be in good working condition and suitable for its Project purpose ; and the Engineer reserves the right to determine the size and number of units of equipment to be used for such work .
The manufacturer ’ s ratings shall be the basis for all Rental Rate Blue Book classifications used for payment purposes .
( “ Rental Rate Blue Book ” as used in these specifications refers to the current edition of the Rental Rate Equipment Watch Blue Book Services , taking into account all current Rate Adjustment Tables , and amendments thereof . )
Trucks will be classified by cubic-yard capacity .
No percentage mark-up will be added for payment purposes to amounts charged by the Contractor based on equipment rental rates .
The Department will not pay rental rates for small tools needed to complete the cost- plus Project work .
For payment purposes , estimated operating costs per hour from the Rental Rate Blue Book will apply only to the actual time during which the equipment is actively being used to perform cost-plus Project work .
For equipment that is also being used for non-cost-plus Project work , the Department will pay the applicable hourly rate only for the actual time that the equipment was assigned to cost-plus Project work .
The applicable period of assignment for each piece of equipment shall start when the equipment commences to be used for cost-plus Project work ordered by the Engineer , and shall end at the time designated by the Engineer .
For equipment brought to the Site exclusively for cost-plus work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for loading and unloading costs and costs of transporting such equipment to and from the Project site ; provided , however , that payment for return transportation from the Site shall not exceed the cost of moving the equipment to the Site .
If such a piece of equipment is self-propelled , and is driven to the Site under its own power , then the Department will pay only operating costs and labor costs for its transport to and from the Project site .
The Department will not , however , pay for any loading , unloading and transportation costs if the equipment is used for any Project work on the Site other than cost-plus work .
( 1 ) Owned Equipment : The Department will pay the Contractor the applicable rental rate as set forth in the Rental Rate Blue Book for any equipment ( 1 ) which the Contractor uses , with the Engineer ’ s authorization , to perform cost-plus Project work , and ( 2 ) which is owned by the Contractor or a subsidiary , affiliate , or parent company of the Contractor ( no matter how far up or down the chain of ownership from the Contractor ) .
The maximum hourly rate to be used in paying for Contractor-owned equipment assigned to cost-plus work shall be the applicable monthly rate in the Rental Rate Blue Book , divided by 176 ( 176 being the number of working hours per month ) .
Should the proper completion of the cost-plus Project work require equipment of a type not covered by the Rental Rate Blue Book , the Engineer will determine , and the Department will make payment to the Contractor at , a reasonable rental rate based on relevant rates prevailing in the area of the Project .
If practicable , such rates shall be determined by the Engineer before the affected work is begun .
If the Contractor proposes that the Engineer use a particular rate in such an instance , the Contractor must disclose to the Engineer the specific sources of , or support for , said rate .
If a piece of equipment owned by the Contractor is assigned to cost-plus Project 72 1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 work , but remains idle for some portion of the period of the cost-plus work , the Department will pay for that idle time at 50 % of the applicable rental rate ( exclusive of operating costs ) in the Rental Rate Blue Book .
For payment purposes , the period of equipment usage shall be deemed to start when the Contractor begins to use the equipment for cost-plus Project work and shall be deemed to end when the equipment is released by the Engineer from use for such work .
Any hours during which the equipment is used for work other than cost- plus Project work will be deducted from the pertinent payment period .
For any piece of Contractor-owned equipment assigned to cost-plus Project work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for an aggregate minimum of 8 hours ( of use time , idle time , or a combination thereof ) in each 24-hour day ( measured from one midnight to the following midnight ) during the assignment period .
No such reimbursement will be made , however , for Saturdays , Sundays and legal holidays during which the Contractor does no Project work , or for any other day on which the Engineer orders the Contractor to do no Project work .
If the equipment is used to perform cost-plus Project work for more than 8 hours in a day , the Department will pay the Contractor at the applicable hourly rate computed on a monthly basis for the actual time of use ; however the Department will not pay the Contractor for more than 8 hours of idle time for a piece of equipment during a given day .
The Department shall have the right to limit its aggregate Project payments for idle time for a given piece of equipment to the replacement value of that equipment .
( 2 ) Rented Equipment : If the Engineer determines that in order to perform the cost- plus Project work the Contractor must rent certain machinery , trucks or other equipment not owned by the Contractor or a subsidiary , affiliate , or parent company of the Contractor ( no matter how far up or down the chain of ownership from the Contractor ) , the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer in writing , in advance of such rental ; ( 1 ) the specific nature of the rental ( s ) , ( 2 ) the reasons for its need for such rental ( s ) , ( 3 ) the anticipated or proposed rental rate ( s ) , and ( 4 ) the estimated duration for the use of each piece of such rented equipment .
Proposed rates for such rented equipment must be based on the following : —A daily rate per hour when the equipment is to be specifically assigned to Project work by the Engineer for a period of 7 consecutive calendar days or less .
—A weekly rate per hour when such assigned time exceeds 7 consecutive calendar days , but does not exceed 21 consecutive calendar days .
—A monthly rate per hour when such assigned time exceeds 21 consecutive calendar days .
The applicable daily , weekly , or monthly rate will be determined at the expiration of 21 calendar days or upon release of the equipment by the Engineer , whichever occurs first .
Interruptions of the rental period , when equipment is used for work other than assigned cost-plus work , will not entitle the Contractor to payment at a rental rate that would be applicable to a shorter period that might arguably have been occasioned by such interruptions .
If so requested by the Engineer , the Contractor shall , prior to renting such 73 1.09.05 Rev .
January 2017 equipment , obtain and submit in writing to the Engineer a minimum of three rate quotes for rental of the equipment .
The Department will pay the Contractor for such rental at the rate actually paid by the Contractor , provided that the given use and rental rate are acceptable to the Engineer .
In order to obtain such payment , the Contractor must provide the Engineer with a copy of the original receipted bill for the rental expenses incurred .
( e ) Administrative Expense : When extra work is performed on a cost-plus basis by a subcontractor acceptable to the Engineer , the Department will pay the Contractor an additional 7.5 % for that work ; such payment will be in addition to the percentage payments described in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) above , as a reimbursement for the Contractor ’ s administrative expense in connection with such work .
The Engineer will approve such additional payments only if and when the Contractor provides to the Engineer receipted invoices for all relevant costs .
( f ) Miscellaneous : The compensation provided for in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) above shall be deemed to be payment in full for the extra work , and shall be deemed as full compensation for same , including costs of superintendence , use of small tools , equipment for which no rental is allowed , safety equipment , consumables , field office overhead , home office overhead , bonding , other insurance , and profit .
The Contractor ’ s representative and the Engineer shall compare their respective records related to the extra work done on a cost-plus basis at the end of each day .
Copies of these records shall be signed by both the Engineer and the Contractor ’ s representative .
The Engineer will then forward a copy of same to the Contractor and to any affected subcontractor in accordance with Department procedures .
Upon payment of such costs by the Contractor , the Contractor shall immediately furnish the Engineer with original receipted bills covering the costs , including transportation charges , for all materials used for such work .
1.09.05—Eliminated Items : The Engineer may eliminate from the Contract any pay unit item , or any portion of Project work contained in a lump sum item by giving written notice of said elimination to the Contractor .
Such elimination shall in no way invalidate the Contract .
The Engineer will make final payment to the Contractor for materials at the actual cost of the materials and any applicable material markup for eliminated pay unit items , or portions of work contained in a lump sum item only under the following terms and conditions : 1. the materials were ordered by the Contractor prior to the Engineer ’ s issuance to the Contractor of a written notice of the unit or work ’ s elimination ( as evidenced by a dated invoice from the vendor ) ; 2. the materials conformed to all Contract requirements ; and 3. the Contractor could not have canceled its order within 2 days after the issuance of the elimination notice .
Any materials paid for by the Department on these conditions shall then be the property of the State , and the State will assume , or will reimburse the Contractor for , the actual cost of any further handling necessary to deliver said materials to a location designated by the Engineer .
If the relevant materials purchased by the Contractor are returnable to their vendor and if the Engineer so directs , the Contractor shall return the materials to the vendor , in which case the Department will reimburse the Contractor for any reasonable charges 74 1.09.06 Rev .
January 2017 made to the Contractor by the vendor for the return of the materials , and for the actual costs to the Contractor of its handling the materials in returning them to the vendor .
Such reimbursements by the Department shall be computed as though the work were being paid for on a cost-plus basis under 1.09.04 .
If the Engineer determines that an elimination of a pay unit item , or portion of work contained in a lump sum item constitutes a “ significant change ” in the character of the Contract work , as defined under 1.04.03 necessitated by a written order of the Engineer , the terms of 1.04.03 shall govern the payment to be made in relation to the eliminated item or work .
1.09.06—Partial Payments : A .
Monthly and Semi-monthly Estimates : 1 Once each month , the Engineer will make , in writing , current estimates of the value of work performed in accordance with the Contract , calculated at Contract unit prices , including but not limited to the value of materials complete in place and materials not yet incorporated into the Project , but approved by the Engineer for payment ( as provided for elsewhere in this article ) .
Retainage will not be held .
Exceptions may be made as follows : ( a ) When not in conflict with the interests of the State , the Contractor may request , and the Engineer may make , semi-monthly estimates for payment .
( b ) If , in the judgment of the Assistant District Engineer , the Project is not proceeding in accordance with the Contract the Engineer may decline to make a payment estimate .
( c ) If the total value of the Project work complete since the last estimate amounts to less than $ 2,500 , the Engineer also may decline to make a payment estimate .
2 The Engineer may also make payment at Contract unit prices for the number of units that represent the value of the Project work performed to date , if said units are essentially , though not totally , complete .
B .
Payment for Stored Materials : Non-perishable materials that are required for Project construction and that the Contractor has produced or purchased specifically for incorporation into the Project , but which have not yet been so incorporated , may be included in a payment estimate if ( i ) the materials meet all applicable Contract specifications , ( ii ) the materials have been delivered to the Project site or to another location approved by the Engineer , and ( iii ) the Contractor has submitted to the Engineer , as evidence of the Contractor ’ s purchase of the materials , either a copy of a receipted bill for same or a Certificate of Title to the materials , in the form approved by the Department , duly-executed by the Contractor and the Vendor .
The Engineer will decide at what fair and appropriate fraction of the applicable Contract price such materials may be included in a payment estimate .
Offsite storage may be approved by the Engineer , provided that the materials proposed for payment are segregated from other materials , clearly labeled as being owned by the Department for use on the identified Project , otherwise handled in compliance with 1.06.03 , and stored in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s recommendations .
All such materials must be readily-available for inventory and inspection by the Engineer .
Storage outside of the State of Connecticut may be considered only when a representative of the 75 1.10.01 Department is able to verify that the above requirements have been satisfied .
For items requiring extended fabrication , manufacturing or assembly time , the Contractor may propose to the Engineer a schedule of values for the related material costs .
If the Engineer approves such a schedule of values , it shall become the Basis of Payment for the stored materials , so long as all other pertinent Contract requirements have been satisfied .
Generic materials having a use on many projects will be considered for payment prior to their incorporation into the Project only if stored in unopened packaging or in large lots .
Stock and raw materials will not be considered for such advance payment without the Engineer ’ s prior written consent thereto .
In no case shall material payments exceed the Contract unit price or lump sum price less the actual value of delivery and installation of the materials ; if they do exceed such a price , the Engineer reserves the right to reduce any related payment accordingly .
Such reductions in payment shall in no way affect the Department ’ s ownership interest in the stored materials .
1.09.07—Final Payment : When the Commissioner has accepted the Project in accordance with 1.08.14 , the Engineer will prepare a final payment estimate .

A Contractor ’ s ignorance of such requirements shall not , in any internal Department proceeding or in any claims or other legal proceeding , constitute justification for the Contractor ’ s failure to consider such requirements in formulating a bid proposal , or for the Contractor ’ s failure to ensure that such legal requirements are met with regard to any Department project in which that Contractor participates .
The Contractor agrees that if it should be awarded the contract for any project supported at least in part by federal funding , the Contractor will not knowingly enter into any lower- tier transaction on that project with a person ( including entities ) who , by virtue of federal law or regulation , or by voluntary agreement , is currently ineligible to participate in such 104 1.20-1.02.14 Rev .

This is because the State is protected by its sovereign immunity .
If local police or other authorities should attempt to stop the Contractor from carrying out activities that are necessary in order for the Contractor to comply with Contract requirements , the Contractor should politely inform the municipal authorities that they probably do not have jurisdiction over the State ’ s project , and the Contractor should immediately inform the Engineer of the attempted interference with Project activities .
If the municipal authorities continue to insist upon preventing the Contractor from carrying out Project activities , the Contractor should not defy the authorities , but , to the extent possible , should await directions from the Engineer .

If the Engineer revises any of those terms in writing during the life of the Contract , the Contractor must comply with said revised terms .
Among other things , the Contract obliges the Contractor to perform all Project work in conformity with the lines , grades , typical cross-sections , dimensions , and other data shown on the plans and other Contract documents .
The Department will pay the Contractor only for work ( including materials necessary for that work , whether or not they are incorporated into that work ) that the Contractor has actually performed under a Contract pay item , and only if the Engineer has accepted said work .
( See 1.02.03 herein ) ( The Contract as it existed when first duly executed by the Engineer is sometimes referred to herein as “ the original Contract. ” ) 1.20-1.04.02—Facilities Construction - Changes in Quantities of Pay Items Including Elimination of Such Items : The quantities given in the original Contract for Contract pay items are only estimates of the quantities of those items that may be required for Project completion .
( The quantities for given pay items in the original Contract are sometimes referred to herein as the “ estimated quantities ” or “ original quantities. ” ) A change in the original quantity of a Contract pay item ( whether an increase or decrease of the quantity ) shall be deemed to have occurred when the Engineer explicitly orders said change of quantity or when the change of quantity has been necessitated by a construction order or other written direction issued by the Engineer to the Contractor .
A Contract pay item shall be deemed a Major Item if the item ’ s lump sum price in the original Contract , or its original quantity multiplied by its unit price in the original Contract , is equal to or greater than 10 % of the original Contract ’ s total bid price .
All other Contract items shall be deemed Minor Items .
The provisions of 1.20-1.04.03 herein shall govern changes in compensation related to a “ significant change ” in Contract work , ( as such changes are defined in 1.04.03 ) necessitated by a written order of the Engineer .
The provisions of 1.20-1.04.04 herein shall govern changes in compensation related to 112 1.20-1.04.02 Rev .
January 2017 any differing site condition encountered by the Contractor that affects its performance of Contract work .
The provisions of 1.20-1.04.03 or 1.20-1.04.04 shall govern in any case in which they conflict with another provision of the Contract .
If the Engineer and the Contractor together determine that a particular change in compensation to the Contractor should be made due to a change in a Contract pay item quantity ( including an item ’ s complete elimination ) , they may make that change in compensation by a written agreement to do so .
Changes in Quantities to Minor Items : ( a ) Quantity Increases of More Than 25 % over Original Quantity : If the actual quantity of work authorized and accepted by the Engineer under a Contract pay item exceeds the item ’ s original quantity by 25 % , the Department will pay for the quantity in excess of 125 % of the original quantity in one of the following three ways .
( One-time fixed costs for which the Department has already reimbursed the Contractor in paying for 125 % of the original quantity shall not be included in a calculation of the actual cost of the excess units . )
( 1 ) Pay for the aggregate excess units on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.20-1.09.04 .
( 2 ) Adjust the unit price by the increase or decrease in the unit price for the excess units , said difference to be calculated as of the time when work under the item was completed .
( 3 ) Pay for the units in any other manner agreed on in writing by the Engineer and the Contractor .
If , however , the aggregate payment for the units in excess of 125 % is less than $ 25,000 ( using the original Contract unit price for the calculation ) the Engineer will not adjust that unit price .
( b ) Quantity Decreases of More Than 25 % below Original Quantity : If the actual quantity of a Contract pay item is less than 75 % of the item ’ s original quantity , the Engineer will not adjust the original Contract unit price for said item unless the Contractor makes a written request to the Engineer for such an adjustment and the Engineer grants it in writing .
If the Engineer grants such a request , the Engineer will adjust the price for each accepted unit of said item performed or provided in one of the following three ways : ( 1 ) Pay for the total item units actually performed or provided in the aggregate units on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.20-1.09.04 .
( 2 ) Adjust the unit price by any increase in the unit price for the deficit units , which shall be the difference between the original Contract unit price and the actual unit cost ( calculated on a cost-plus basis as provided in 1.20-1.09.04 ) of the total units performed or provided , said difference to be calculated as of the time when work under the item was completed .
( 3 ) Pay for the item units performed or provided in any manner agreed on in writing by the Engineer and the Contractor .
In no instance however , shall the unit price paid for the number of units performed or provided , when their quantity has been decreased by more than 25 % of the original quantity , be less than their original unit price ; and in no instance shall the aggregate payment for such a decreased quantity of items be more than the Engineer would have 113 1.20-1.04.04 Rev .
January 2017 paid for the performance or provision of 75 % of the original quantity at the original unit price .
Regarding treatment of eliminated Contract items , refer to 1.20-1.09.05 herein .
1.20-1.04.03—Facilities Construction - Changes in Quantities and Significant Changes in the Character of Work : ( i ) The Engineer reserves the right to make , in writing , at any time during the work , such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project .
Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the surety , and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as altered .
( ii ) If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the Contract , whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such other work to become significantly different in character , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profit , will be made to the Contract .
The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work .
If a basis can not be agreed upon , then an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable .
( iii ) If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the Contract , the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the Contract .
( iv ) The term “ significant change ” shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances : ( A ) When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction ; or ( B ) When a Major Item of work , as defined elsewhere in the Contract , is increased in excess of 125 % or decreased below 75 % of the original Contract quantity .
Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 % of original Contract item quantity , or in case of a decrease below 75 % , to the actual amount of work performed 1.20-1.04.04—Facilities Construction - Differing Site Conditions : ( i ) During the progress of the work , if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the Site differing materially from those indicated in the Contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature , differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the Contract , are encountered at the Site , the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before the Site is disturbed and before the affected work is performed .
( ii ) Upon written notification , the Engineer will investigate the conditions , and if it is determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the Contract , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of his/her determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
( iii ) No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed 114 1.20-1.04.05 Rev .
January 2017 unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
( iv ) No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any effects caused on unchanged work .

This advance notification will allow the Department to publish news releases and provide public radio announcements to inform the public of revised traffic patterns or possible traffic delays .
Failure of the Contractor to provide such timely notice will subject the Contractor to stop work orders until such time as the 7 days of required notice have run from either the Contractor ’ s giving of the relevant notice or the Department ’ s discovery of the pertinent alteration of traffic conditions .
1.20-1.08.05—Facilities Construction - Personnel and Equipment : The Contractor shall assign to the Project only personnel who are careful and competent .
The Engineer may demand the removal of any person employed by the Contractor on the Project who is , in the opinion of the Engineer , guilty of misconduct on a Department project or incompetent or negligent in the performance of his duties on a Department project or any portion thereof , or who neglects or refuses to comply with directions given by the Engineer in connection with the Project .
Following such a demand for his removal , such person shall not work again on the Project without the prior written consent of the Engineer .
Should the Contractor , following such a demand for removal , continue to employ or again employ such person on any Department project without the required consent of the Engineer , the Commissioner may withhold all estimated payments that are or may become due to the Contractor for the Project , or the Engineer may shut down the Project until the Contractor has complied with the Engineer ’ s orders concerning that person .
The use of convict labor on projects funded in whole or in part by the federal government is prohibited .
The Contractor shall furnish whatever equipment is necessary for the Project to be performed in a manner and at a rate of progress that is acceptable to the Engineer .

( With regard to Items 1-4 , refer to 23 CFR , Section 635.109 , “ Standardized Changed Condition Clauses , ” Required FHWA Contract Specification . )
1.20-1.08.07—Facilities Construction - Determination of Contract Time : Unless the Contract requires the Project completion by a specified date , the number of calendar days allowed for the completion of the Project will be fixed by the Department , will be stated in the Contract , and will be known ( with any subsequent adjustments ) as the “ Contract time. ” If at any time the Contractor submits a schedule showing completion of the work more than 30 calendar days in advance of the Contract completion date , the Department will issue a no-cost construction order revising the allowable Contract time to that shown on the Contractor ’ s schedule .
When the Contract time is stated on a calendar-day basis , that time shall be the number of consecutive calendar days contained in the Contract period designated in the Contract , INCLUDING the time period from each December 1 through the following March 31 .
The Contract time will begin to run on the date designated in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice to Proceed ” as the date for commencement of the Project , and the time will be computed as herein provided on a consecutive-day basis , including all Saturdays , Sundays , holidays , and non-work days .
The total elapsed time in calendar days , computed as described above , from the commencement date specified in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice to Proceed ” to the “ Substantial Completion ” date specified in the Engineer ’ s “ Notice of Substantial Completion ” shall be considered as the time used in the performance of the Contract work .
Suspension involving cessation of work on all items , except minor construction not affected by or connected with the cause of suspension , shall be considered as total suspension .
In case of a total suspension of the Project ordered by the Engineer , not due to any fault of the Contractor , the elapsed time during which the Project is suspended will not be charged against the Contract time .
Work of an emergency nature ordered by the Engineer for the convenience or safety of the public or the protection of the Project work , if performed during a period of total suspension , will not be charged against Contract 172 1.20-1.08.08 Rev .
January 2017 time .
No such time allowance will be granted in case of partial suspension ; provided , however , that the Contractor may request and the Engineer may grant permission to perform specific limited operations during such a partial suspension , in which case Contract time chargeable for those operations shall be negotiated and agreed to in writing before such operations may commence .
1.20-1.08.08—Facilities Construction - Extension of Time : The Contractor may present to the Engineer a request in writing for an extension of Contract time if the time necessary for completion of the Project has been increased due to extra or added work or delays resulting from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor , except for weather or seasonal conditions ( unless extraordinary and catastrophic ) .
Such causes include , but are not limited to , natural catastrophes , acts of the State in either its sovereign or contractual capacity , acts of another contractor in the performance of a contract with the State , the presence of utility facilities ( including railroads ) , fires , strikes , floods , or delays by suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or such suppliers .
The Contractor ’ s plea that insufficient Contract time was allowed under the Contract before commencement of the Project is not a valid reason for extending the Contract time .
Requests for an extension of time with adequate substantiation must be presented within 60 calendar days from the event that is the basis of the request or from the first effect of such an event on the Project .
The Contractor will be responsible for providing all the documentation necessary to support the reasonableness of the additional time requested .
This shall include a Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis and accompanying narrative that includes the specific dates and number of days for which the extension is sought , the basis or bases for the extension , and the schedule analysis illustrated in a graphic representation of the schedule impacts , such as a bar chart or other type of graphic schedule .
The critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
Such requests will be considered by the Engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
Requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the Contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time , or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the Contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the Project as to materials , labor , or equipment .
For all Project delays or time increases , except as provided below , additional Contract time is the sole remedy that the Contractor may have , and such periods of additional Contract time shall be deemed “ Non-Compensable Delays. ” For delays caused by the State in its Contractual capacity , the Contractor may , in addition to a time extension , request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay , and such periods of extended Contract time may be deemed “ Compensable Delays. ” The period of a compensable delay is limited as follows : ( 1 ) It may not include time more than 60 days prior to the Engineer ’ s receiving written notice from the Contractor , with adequate substantiation , of its intent to claim damages for the delay , and ( 2 ) It may not include periods of delay for which the State was responsible , but during which the Contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the State 173 1.20-1.08.09 Rev .
January 2017 was not responsible .
Damages for periods of Project delay for which the State had sole responsibility shall be limited to the increased costs incurred by the Contractor ( which shall not include lost profits ) , which the Contractor substantiates and which the Contractor shows were caused by such delays .
The Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis shall include at a minimum : 1 .
The manner in which the Contractor planned to construct the Project , in terms of activities , logical interrelationships of activities , work sequences , activity durations , and calendars .
2 .
The actual duration and sequences of the activities , based on what actually occurred on the Project .
3 .
The variances between the planned and actual performance of the work , listed in a chronological and cumulative manner , summing to the net total delay on the Project at the time of the request .
a .
The causes of the variances between the planned and actual performance of the work , specifically allocating legal responsibility for each to either the Department or the Contractor .
b .
The effects of the variances in work sequences , activity durations , manpower , and resources on the incurred costs of the affected party or parties .
4 .
An identification analysis of the causes of any concurrent delays on the Project .
5 .
Statements as to whether the time extension days sought are compensable or non-compensable , along with a specific statement of any compensation request in connection with the time extension .
Any request for a time extension that does not include a corresponding request for compensation will be assumed to be a request for a non-compensable time extension .
6 .
All associated analysis documents , worksheets , schedules and contemporaneous documents supporting the Critical Path Method Schedule Delay Analysis .
1.20-1.08.09—Facilities Construction - Failure to Complete Work on Time : Time is an essential element of the Contract .
Since the prosecution of the Project may obstruct traffic , interfere with business , and otherwise inconvenience the public , it is important that the Project be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the Contract , including engineering , inspection and supervision , will also be increased as the time for Project completion is lengthened .
Therefore , for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the Contract time has expired , the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the Contract shall be deducted from any money due to the Contractor .
Liquidated damages are not a penalty , but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .
Liquidated damages as specified in the Contract shall be assessed against the Contractor per calendar day from that day until the date on which the Project is substantially completed .
The Engineer has the right to deduct the amount of the liquidated damages assessed against the Contractor from any estimated payment for work performed under the Contract or under any other State contract , or from any other sums owed by the State to the Contractor ; or to claim and recover such sums by process of law .

These separate items will be measured for payment on a unit price or lump sum basis ( whichever is applicable ) for which a separate bid price is required , at the quantities indicated in the Bid Proposal Form .
Each item to be measured is more specifically described in a corresponding Standard Specification or a special provision .
Standard Items are referenced by their item numbers ; refer to the applicable article for the requirements for this item .
Special provisions are referenced by their item number followed by an “ A ” suffix ; refer to the special provisions for the requirements for this item .
All work depicted on the Contract Plans and described in the Contract Specifications , including mobilization and project closeout , is included in the MLSI of the Project , with the exception of the unit price or other lump sum items listed in the Bid Proposal Form .
Any work incidental to an item which is not specifically described or included in the item , but which is required for performance and completion of the work required under the Contract , is included in the MLSI .
1.20-1.09.01—Facilities Construction - Measurement of Quantities : Work completed in compliance with the Contract will be measured by the Engineer according to U.S .
Customary standard measures , and quantities of work performed shall be computed based on such measurements made in accordance with the methods of measurement described herein under provisions regarding the applicable Contract item .
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Contract , only work that is within the payment limits prescribed by the Contract or ordered by the Engineer will be measured for payment .
No payment will be made for work that is not actually performed .
Structures shall be measured and quantities computed according to the neat lines shown on the plans ( as those plans may be revised by authorization of the Engineer ) , or as may otherwise be required by the Contract .
Quantities of materials measured for payment by net weight shall be measured in tons , while contained in hauling vehicles on scales furnished by and at the expense of the Contractor .
The scales shall be satisfactory to the Engineer and shall be sealed .
182 1.20-1.09.02 When required by the Engineer , an inspector will be appointed and compensated by the Department to check the weight of all materials to be incorporated into the Project .
The tare weight of trucks used to haul materials being paid for by weight shall be taken at such times as the Engineer directs .
1.20-1.09.02—Facilities Construction - Value Engineering Change Proposal : These Value Engineering Change Proposal ( VECP ) provisions apply as encouragement to the Contractor to initiate , develop , and present to the Department for consideration cost- or time- reduction proposals or a combination of both conceived by the Contractor , involving changes to the drawings , designs , specifications , or other requirements of the Contract .
These provisions do not apply unless the proposal submitted is specifically identified by the Contractor as being presented for consideration as a VECP .
All such proposals must be made on the Department ’ s VECP form , copies of which are available from the Department .
The Department reserves the right to decline to review , or to reject after initial review , any VECP .
Before expending considerable funds in development of a formal VECP , the Contractor shall submit a conceptual Proposal to the Department on Department-provided forms .
The proposals which may be considered as VECPs are those which , if implemented , ( a ) would require modification of the Contract by construction order ; ( b ) would produce a savings to the Department by calling for the use of items or methods less costly than those specified in the Contract ; ( c ) would not alter necessary standardized features of the original Project ; and ( d ) would not impair essential functions or characteristics of the construction called for by the original Contract , such as service life , reliability , economy of operation , and ease of maintenance .
Material substitution alone will not be considered as a VECP .
A VECP may shorten Contract time , however , acceleration alone will not be considered as a VECP .
Cautions and Conditions : 1 .
The Contractor is cautioned not to base any bid or bid price on the anticipated approval of a VECP and to recognize that such Proposal may be rejected .
The Contractor will be required to perform the Contract in accordance with the existing Contract plans and specifications at the prices bid unless and until the Department formally accepts , in writing , the Contractor ’ s VECP .
2 .
In order for the Department to consider such a Proposal , the savings likely to be generated by the Proposal must be sufficient , in the sole judgment of the Department , to warrant its review and processing by the Department .
All costs resulting from such review or processing will be borne by the Department .
Before any VECP will be considered by the Department , the Department must determine , in its sole judgment , that implementation of the Proposal would result in a total cost savings of more than $ 100,000.00 , reflecting a savings of at least $ 50,000.00 for the Department .
The Department will not consider any VECP that would require an increase in Contract time .
3 .
All VECPs apply only to the ongoing Contract , and whether approved or not , such Proposals become the property of the Department .
Such Proposals shall contain no restrictions imposed by the Contractor on their use or disclosure by the State .
The Department will have the right to use , duplicate and disclose in whole or in part any data necessary for the use or implementation of the Proposal .
The Department 183 1.20-1.09.02 retains the right to use any accepted Proposal or part thereof on any other current or subsequent Department projects without any obligation to the Contractor for such use .
This provision is not intended to deny rights provided by law with respect to patented materials or processes .
4 .
If the Department already has under consideration certain revisions of the Contract or has approved certain changes in specifications or standard drawings for general use which subsequently appear in a VECP , the Department may reject the Contractor ’ s Proposal and may proceed with such revisions without any obligation to the Contractor .
5 .
The Proposal must be presented and approved in writing prior to the Contractor ’ s undertaking any work on the Contract items involved in the proposal .
Savings due to a reduction in quantities or deletion of items which result solely from adjustments to field conditions , and Proposals which would only waive specification or other Contract requirements , are not considered to be VECPs .
6 .
The Contractor shall have no claim against the Department for any costs or delays due to the Department ’ s review or rejection of a VECP , including , but not limited to , development costs , anticipated profits , or increased material or labor costs resulting from delays in the review or rejection of such Proposal .
7 .
The Department will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a Proposal and of the estimated net savings in construction costs that would result from adoption of all or any part ( s ) of such Proposal .
In determining such estimated net savings , the Department reserves the right to disregard the Contract bid prices if , in the judgment of the Engineer , such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of work to be performed or deleted under the Proposal .
Errors in the estimated quantities in the bid proposal form for the Contract shall be corrected by the Department prior to calculating the savings that would likely result from adoption of the VECP .
8 .
The Engineer may reject all or any portion of work performed pursuant to an approved VECP if the Engineer determines that unsatisfactory results are being obtained because of the Proposal ’ s implementation with regard to that work .
The Engineer may direct the removal of such rejected work and require the Contractor to proceed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
Where modifications of the VECP have been approved in order to adjust to field or other conditions , payment will be limited to the total amount payable for the work at the Contract bid prices , as if the pertinent work had been constructed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
The Contractor waives the right to use such rejection or limitation of reimbursement as the basis of any claim against the State for delay damages or for any other damages or costs .
9 .
VECPs must meet the requirements of the specifications or standards of the Department .
The standards governing the original design of the Contract will be the minimal standard allowed .
10 .
If additional information is needed in order for the Department to evaluate Proposals , the Contractor must provide the Department with this information within 14 calendar days of such request or within such other time period as may be approved by the Department .
Failure to do so will result in rejection of the Proposal .
11 .
The Contractor shall provide revised Project plans , specifications and estimates to the Department in construction order format , reflecting such changes as would be 184 1.20-1.09.02 required for implementation of the VECP .
The Contractor shall be solely responsible for any errors or omissions resulting from such revisions .
12 .
Savings not directly related to the Contract , such as , but not limited to , reductions in inspection or testing costs or Department overhead , will not be included in the savings calculation for any VECP .
After the Contractor submits a conceptual Proposal , they will be notified in writing of the acceptability or the reason ( s ) for its rejection .
The Department retains the right to reject the formal Proposal even if the conceptual Proposal was determined acceptable .
VECPs will be processed in the same manner as are alterations of the Contract that require a construction order .
VECP Submittal Requirements : 1 .
A statement that the Proposal is being submitted as a VECP .
2 .
A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirements and the proposed change ( s ) , and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each , taking into account considerations of service life , economy of operations , ease of maintenance , desired appearance , safety , and environmental impacts or necessary permit changes .
When an item ’ s function or characteristics would be altered by implementation of the Proposal , a justification of the anticipated effects of the alteration on the end item ’ s performance must be included in the Proposal .
A life- cycle cost analysis must be included for items involving alteration of functional characteristics .
Factors for determining future worth will be provided by the Department .
3 .
Complete plans , specifications , and computations signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of Connecticut , showing that the proposed Contract revisions would incorporate the same design criteria and restrictions that applied to the original Contract features and requirements .
Said revisions shall be submitted by the Contractor in the Department ’ s construction order format consisting of 1 paper copy of the plans and 1 electronic copy of the plans as a portable document format ( PDF ) file , indicating ( a ) quantity increases and decreases by item number , with associated cost ; ( b ) new items , with their quantities and costs ; ( c ) specifications in contract format ; and , if needed , ( d ) compliance permit applications and revisions in accordance with 1.20-1.10.01 through 1.20-1.10.08 of these specifications .
4 .
A complete analysis of the probable cost effects of the proposed changes on Project construction , future operations in connection with the completed Project , maintenance and durability of completed Project construction , and other aspects of the Project , as appropriate .
5 .
The date by which the Proposal would have to be implemented in order for the Department to obtain the maximum cost reduction from the Proposal ’ s implementation .
The period established by the date must allow the Department ample time for review and processing of the Proposal .
Should the Department find that it does not have sufficient time for such review and processing , it may reject the Proposal solely on such basis .
If the Department fails to respond to the Proposal by said date , the Contractor shall consider the Proposal to be rejected and shall have no claims against the State as a result thereof .
185 1.20-1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 6 .
A description of the effect that the implementation of the Proposal would likely have on the time required to complete the Project .
Payment for accepted VECPs : 1 .
The changes resulting from a VECP will be incorporated into the Contract by construction order and shall reflect the changes in existing unit bid item quantities , or any new agreed price items , cost-plus lump sum , or any combination thereof , as appropriate , in accordance with the Specifications and as determined by the Department .
Any lump sum submission shall be accompanied by a schedule of payment values .
2 .
The Contract prices for the revised Project work will be paid directly as accomplished .
In addition to such payment , the Department will pay the Contractor , under a separate item or a Value Engineering Incentive item , 50 % of the total savings obtained by the State as a result of its implementation of the VECP .
An estimate of said savings is to be calculated by the Department within 1 week prior to the Proposal ’ s acceptance , by ( a ) estimating what it will cost the Department to carry out the Project as revised according to the VECP ; ( b ) estimating what it would have cost the Department to carry out the Project under the terms of the Contract as modified by any construction orders as of the time that the Department accepted the Proposal ; and ( c ) subtracting the sum estimated as per ( a ) from the sum estimated as per ( b ) .
When the implementation of the Proposal , including all related construction , has been completed , the Department will calculate the actual savings that resulted from it .
The Department will then distribute half of the actual savings to the Contractor .
3 .
The Contractor ’ s costs for development , design , submission and processing of the VECP are not eligible for reimbursement .
4 .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor based on any cost savings not identified in the VECP prior to its acceptance .
5 .
The cost savings from a VECP that is exclusively time reduction shall be calculated as the number of Contract days reduced multiplied by the amount of liquidated damages for 1 day under the Contract .
1.20-1.09.03—Facilities Construction - Increased or Decreased Quantities : Whenever the quantity of any item as given in both the bid proposal form and Contract is increased or decreased , the Department will pay for such item at the Contract price , on the basis of the actual quantity completed , except as otherwise expressly authorized under the provisions of 1.20-1.04.02 , 1.20-1.04.03 or 1.20- 1.04.04 .
1.20-1.09.04—Facilities Construction - Extra and Cost-Plus Work : Extra work shall be performed only under the conditions and subject to the requirements outlined in 1.20- 1.04.05 .
Payment for extra work may be made on any unit price or lump sum price or other basis to which the Engineer and the Contractor agreed in writing , or the Engineer may order that the Contractor will be paid for the work on the cost-plus basis described in this Article .
The following sets forth the components of the cost-plus basis for making payments : ( a ) Labor : ( 1 ) For all labor used by the Contractor for the subject work , the Department will pay the Contractor the wage rate that it actually paid for same , as shown by its certified 186 1.20-1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 payroll , which shall be at least the minimum rate established for the Project by the CT Department or the U.S. Department of Labor .
For all foremen in direct charge of Project work , the Department will pay the Contractor the actual wage paid to the foremen as shown on the Contractor ’ s certified payroll .
( 2 ) The Department will reimburse the Contractor for the actual costs paid to , or on behalf of , workers by reason of allowances , health and welfare benefits , pension fund benefits and other such benefits in connection with the subject work , when such amounts are required by a collective bargaining agreement or another employment contract generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the Project .
The Contractor shall certify all such costs in writing to the Engineer .
( 3 ) For property damage , liability and workmen ’ s compensation insurance premiums , unemployment insurance contributions and social security taxes on Project cost- plus work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for its actual Project costs .
The Contractor shall provide to the Engineer documentation , satisfactory to the Engineer in form and substance , of all such costs .
( 4 ) The Department will also pay to the Contractor an amount equal to 20 % ( 15 % for overhead , 5 % for profit ) of the total sums described in ( a ) ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) above .
No part of the salary or expenses of anyone connected with the Contractor ’ s forces above the grade of project superintendent , who provides general supervision of Project work , will be included in the above payment calculations , except when the Contractor ’ s organization is entirely occupied with cost-plus work , in which case the salary of a superintendent may be included in said labor item when the nature of the pertinent Project work is such that , in the opinion of the Engineer , a superintendent was required for that work .
The Engineer and the Contractor may agree in writing to the allowable rate of pay for such superintendent , or the Engineer may make payment based on such rate as he deems reasonable .
The Engineer reserves the right to determine the number and type of personnel to be employed for the cost-plus Project work .
( b ) Specialized Work : When the Engineer directs the Contractor to perform specialized work requiring skills , tools and equipment substantially unlike those ordinarily used by the Contractor or its authorized Project subcontractors , the Department will pay the Contractor for the use of a specialist to perform the specialized work .
For such specialized services , including materials incorporated into the Project , the Department will pay the Contractor its actual costs , plus additional compensation in accordance with subparagraph ( e ) below .
If so requested by the Engineer , the Contractor shall obtain and submit to the Engineer , prior to performing such specialized work , a minimum of three price quotes for the work .
( c ) Materials : For all materials necessary for cost-plus Project work , the Department will pay the Contractor its actual cost for such materials , including delivery charges as shown by original receipted bills , plus 15 % of the sum of said cost and charges .
In lieu of receipted bills for materials used for the Project , but which were not specifically purchased for the Project , but rather were taken from the Contractor ’ s stock , the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer an affidavit certifying that such materials were not purchased for the Project , that the materials were taken from the Contractor ’ s stock , that the quantity claimed to have been used on the Project was actually so used , and that the price claimed for the materials reflects their fair market value at the time of 187 1.20-1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 their use on the Project .
The Department will pay for costs of transporting the materials to the Project site , in accordance with subparagraphs ( a ) and ( d ) hereof .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor for any penalty or charge incurred by the Contractor due to the Contractor ’ s late or delayed payment for the pertinent materials .
( d ) Equipment : All equipment used for cost-plus Project work must , in the judgment of the Engineer , be in good working condition and suitable for its Project purpose ; and the Engineer reserves the right to determine the size and number of units of equipment to be used for such work .
The manufacturer ’ s ratings shall be the basis for all Rental Rate Blue Book classifications used for payment purposes .
( “ Rental Rate Blue Book ” as used in these specifications refers to the current edition of the Rental Rate Equipment Watch Blue Book Services , taking into account all current Rate Adjustment Tables , and amendments thereof . )
Trucks will be classified by cubic-yard capacity .
No percentage mark-up will be added for payment purposes to amounts charged by the Contractor based on equipment rental rates .
The Department will not pay rental rates for small tools needed to complete the cost- plus Project work .
For payment purposes , estimated operating costs per hour from the Rental Rate Blue Book will apply only to the actual time during which the equipment is actively being used to perform cost-plus Project work .
For equipment that is also being used for non-cost-plus Project work , the Department will pay the applicable hourly rate only for the actual time that the equipment was assigned to cost-plus Project work .
The applicable period of assignment for each piece of equipment shall start when the equipment commences to be used for cost-plus Project work ordered by the Engineer , and shall end at the time designated by the Engineer .
For equipment brought to the Site exclusively for cost-plus work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for loading and unloading costs and costs of transporting such equipment to and from the Project site ; provided , however , that payment for return transportation from the Site shall not exceed the cost of moving the equipment to the Site .
If such a piece of equipment is self-propelled , and is driven to the Site under its own power , then the Department will pay only operating costs and labor costs for its transport to and from the Project site .
The Department will not , however , pay for any loading , unloading and transportation costs if the equipment is used for any Project work on the Site other than cost-plus work .
( 1 ) Owned Equipment : The Department will pay the Contractor the applicable rental rate set forth in the Rental Rate Blue Book for any equipment ( 1 ) which the Contractor uses , with the Engineer ’ s authorization , to perform cost-plus Project work , and ( 2 ) which is owned by the Contractor or a subsidiary , affiliate , or parent company of the Contractor ( no matter how far up or down the chain of ownership from the Contractor ) .
The maximum hourly rate to be used in paying for Contractor-owned equipment assigned to cost-plus work shall be the applicable monthly rate in the Rental Rate Blue Book , divided by 176 ( 176 working hours per month ) .
Should the proper completion of the cost-plus Project work require equipment of a type not covered by the Rental Rate Blue Book , the Engineer will determine , and the Department will make payment to the Contractor at , a reasonable rental rate based on relevant rates prevailing in the area of the Project .
If practicable , such 188 1.20-1.09.04 Rev .
January 2017 rates shall be determined by the Engineer before the affected work is begun .
If the Contractor proposes that the Engineer use a particular rate in such an instance , the Contractor must disclose to the Engineer the specific sources of , or support for , said rate .
If a piece of equipment owned by the Contractor is assigned to cost-plus Project work , but remains idle for some portion of the period of the cost-plus work , the Department will pay for that idle time at 50 % of the applicable rental rate ( exclusive of operating costs ) in the Rental Rate Blue Book .
For payment purposes , the period of equipment usage shall be deemed to start when the Contractor begins to use the equipment for cost-plus Project work and shall be deemed to end when the equipment is released by the Engineer from use for such work .
Any hours during which the equipment is used for work other than cost- plus Project work will be deducted from the pertinent payment period .
For any piece of Contractor-owned equipment assigned to cost-plus Project work , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for an aggregate minimum of 8 hours ( of use time , idle time , or a combination thereof ) in each 24-hour day ( measured from one midnight to the following midnight ) during the assignment period .
No such reimbursement will be made , however , for Saturdays , Sundays and legal holidays during which the Contractor does no Project work , or for any other day on which the Engineer orders the Contractor to do no Project work .
If the equipment is used to perform cost-plus Project work for more than 8 hours in a day , the Department will pay the Contractor at the applicable hourly rate computed on a monthly basis for the actual time of use ; however the Department will not pay the Contractor for more than 8 hours of idle time for a piece of equipment during a given day .
The Department shall have the right to limit its aggregate Project payments for idle time for a given piece of equipment to the replacement value of that equipment .
( 2 ) Rented Equipment : If the Engineer determines that in order to perform the cost- plus Project work the Contractor must rent certain machinery , trucks or other equipment not owned by the Contractor or a subsidiary , affiliate , or parent company of the Contractor ( no matter how far up or down the chain of ownership from the Contractor ) , the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer in writing , in advance of such rental , 1. the specific nature of the rental ( s ) , 2. the reasons for its need for such rental ( s ) , 3. the anticipated or proposed rental rate ( s ) , and 4. the estimated duration for the use of each piece of such rented equipment .
Proposed rates for such rented equipment must be based on the following : —A daily rate per hour when the equipment is to be specifically assigned to Project work by the Engineer for a period of 7 consecutive calendar days or less .
—A weekly rate per hour when such assigned time exceeds 7 consecutive calendar days , but does not exceed 21 consecutive calendar days .
—A monthly rate per hour when such assigned time exceeds 21 consecutive calendar days .
The applicable daily , weekly , or monthly rate will be determined at the expiration of 21 calendar days or upon release of the equipment by the Engineer , whichever 189 1.20-1.09.05 Rev .
January 2017 occurs first .
Interruptions of the rental period , when equipment is used for work other than assigned cost-plus work , will not entitle the Contractor to payment at a rental rate that would be applicable to a shorter period that might arguably have been occasioned by such interruptions .
If so requested by the Engineer , the Contractor shall , prior to renting such equipment , obtain and submit to the Engineer in writing a minimum of three rate quotes for rental of the equipment .
The Department will pay the Contractor for such rental at the rate actually paid by the Contractor , provided that the given use and rental rate are acceptable to the Engineer .
In order to obtain such payment , the Contractor must provide the Engineer with a copy of the original receipted bill for the rental expenses incurred .
( e ) Administrative Expense : When extra work is performed on a cost-plus basis is performed by a subcontractor acceptable to the Engineer , the Department will pay the Contractor an additional 7.5 % for that work ; such payment will be in addition to the percentage payments described in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) above , as a reimbursement for the Contractor ’ s administrative expense in connection with such work .
The Engineer will approve such additional payments only if and when the Contractor provides to the Engineer receipted invoices for all relevant costs .
( f ) Miscellaneous : The compensation provided for in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) above shall be deemed to be payment in full for the extra work , and shall be deemed as full compensation for same , including costs of superintendence , use of small tools , equipment for which no rental is allowed , safety equipment , consumables , field office overhead , home office overhead , bonding , other insurance , and profit .
The Contractor ’ s representative and the Engineer shall compare their respective records related to the extra work done on a cost-plus basis at the end of each day .
Copies of these records shall be signed by both the Engineer and the Contractor ’ s representative .
The Engineer will then forward a copy of same to the Contractor and to any affected subcontractor in accordance with Department procedures .
Upon payment of such costs by the Contractor , the Contractor shall immediately furnish the Engineer with original receipted bills covering the costs , including transportation charges , for all materials used for such work .
1.20-1.09.05—Facilities Construction - Eliminated Items : The Engineer may eliminate from the Contract any pay unit item , or any portion of Project work contained in a lump sum item by giving written notice of said elimination to the Contractor .
Such elimination shall in no way invalidate the Contract .
The Engineer will make final payment to the Contractor for materials at the actual cost of the materials for eliminated pay unit items or portions of work contained in a lump sum item only under the following terms and conditions : 1. the materials were ordered by the Contractor prior to the Engineer ’ s issuance to the Contractor of a written notice of the unit or work ’ s elimination ( as evidenced by a dated invoice from the vendor ) ; 2. the materials conformed to all Contract requirements ; and 3. the Contractor could not have cancelled its order within 2 days after the issuance of the elimination notice .
Any materials paid for by the Department on these conditions shall then be the property of the State , and the State will assume , or will reimburse the Contractor for , the actual cost of any further handling necessary to deliver said materials to a location designated 190 1.20-1.09.06 Rev .
January 2017 by the Engineer .
If the relevant materials purchased by the Contractor are returnable to their vendor and if the Engineer so directs , the Contractor shall return the materials to the vendor , in which case the Department will reimburse the Contractor for any reasonable changes made to the Contractor by the vendor for the return of the materials , and for the actual costs to the Contractor of its handling the materials in returning them to the vendor .
Such reimbursements by the Department shall be computed as though the work were being paid for on a cost-plus basis under 1.20-1.09.04 .
If the Engineer determines that an elimination of a pay unit item or portion of work contained in a lump sum item constitutes a “ significant change ” in the character of the Contract work , as defined under 1.20-1.04.03 , necessitated by a written order of the Engineer , the terms of 1.20-1.04.03 shall govern the payment to be made in relation to the eliminated item or work .
1.20-1.09.06—Facilities Construction - Partial Payments : A .
Monthly and Semi-monthly Estimates : ( 1 ) Once each month , the Engineer will make , in writing , current estimates of the value of work performed in accordance with the Contract , calculated at Contract unit prices , including but not limited to the value of materials complete in place and materials not yet incorporated into the Project , but approved by the Engineer for payment ( as provided for elsewhere in this article ) .
Retainage will not be held .
Exceptions may be made as follows : ( a ) When not in conflict with the interests of the State , the Contractor may request , and the Engineer may make , semi-monthly estimates for payment .
( b ) If , in the judgment of the Assistant District Engineer , the Project is not proceeding in accordance with the Contract the Engineer may decline to make a payment estimate .
( c ) If the total value of the Project work completed since the last estimate amounts to less than $ 2,500 , the Engineer also may decline to make a payment estimate .
( 2 ) The Engineer may also make payment at Contract unit prices for the number of units that represent the value of the Project work performed to date , if said units are essentially , though not totally , complete .
B .
Payment for Stored Materials : Non-perishable materials that are required for Project construction and that the Contractor has produced or purchased specifically for incorporation into the Project , but which have not yet been so incorporated , may be included in a payment estimate if ( i ) the materials meet all applicable Contract specifications , ( ii ) the materials have been delivered to the Project site or to another location approved by the Engineer , and ( iii ) the Contractor has submitted to the Engineer , as evidence of the Contractor ’ s purchase of the materials , either a copy of a receipted bill for same or a Certificate of Title to the materials , in the form approved by the Department , duly-executed by the Contractor and the Vendor .
The Engineer will decide at what fair and appropriate fraction of the applicable Contract price such materials may be included in a payment estimate .
Offsite storage may be approved by the Engineer , provided that the materials proposed for payment are segregated from other materials , clearly labeled as being owned by the 191 1.20-1.09.09 Department for use on the identified Project , otherwise handled in compliance with 1.20- 1.06.03 , and stored in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s recommendations .
All such materials must be readily-available for inventory and inspection by the Engineer .
Storage outside of the State of Connecticut may be considered only when a representative of the Department is able to verify that the above requirements have been satisfied .
For items requiring extended fabrication , manufacturing or assembly time , the Contractor may propose to the Engineer a schedule of values for the related material costs .
If the Engineer approves such a schedule of values , it shall become the Basis of Payment for the stored materials , so long as all other pertinent Contract requirements have been satisfied .
Generic materials having a use on many projects will be considered for payment prior to their incorporation into the Project only if stored in unopened packaging or in large lots .
Stock and raw materials will not be considered for such advance payment without the Engineer ’ s prior written consent thereto .
In no case shall material payments exceed the Contract unit price or lump sum price less the actual value of delivery and installation of the materials ; if they do exceed such a price , the Engineer reserves the right to reduce any related payment accordingly .
Such reductions in payment shall in no way affect the Department ’ s ownership interest in the stored materials .
1.20-1.09.07—Facilities Construction - Final Payment : When the Commissioner has accepted the Project in accordance with 1.20-1.08.14 , the Engineer will prepare a final payment estimate .

No subsequent layer shall be placed until the specified compaction is obtained for the previous layer .
7 .
Stability : If after full compliance with the requirements of these specifications with regard to excavation , placement and compaction density requirements , a stable embankment or subgrade has not been obtained , the Contractor shall proceed to perform such corrective work as is necessary to produce a stable embankment or subgrade .
This work may include , but not necessarily be limited to control of moisture to within limits suitable for obtaining the required stability , blending with rock or granular material from any Project excavation or borrow , or free draining material or any combination thereof ; removal and replacement with acceptably compacted material or a combination of these methods approved by the Engineer .
Any of the foregoing methods may be supplemented by suspending embankment operations and allowing the material to dry .
When embankments are constructed of material from Project excavation and the Engineer determines that the material properly compacted is not sufficiently stabilized , the cost of corrective measures directed by the Engineer shall be paid for at applicable Contract unit prices , or in the absence thereof , as extra work .
If the corrective work on embankments constructed of Project excavation is necessary , and requires departure from the plan for grading operations to obtain material at locations other than shown on the aforementioned plan which result in increased net costs to the Contractor , such increased costs will be paid as extra work , except that no payment will be made for overhaul for any corrective material for the first 1/2 mile of increased hauling distance .
When embankments are constructed of borrow , they shall be stable .
In this case however , the methods and material used to obtain such stability shall be determined by the Contractor and performed at its expense .

Cofferdams which become tilted or displaced prior to the completion of all work to be done within them , shall be righted , reset , or enlarged as may be necessary to provide the clearance for the unobstructed performance of all necessary work , and such corrections and adjustments of cofferdams shall be at the sole expense of the Contractor .
Cofferdams shall be completely dewatered as required to complete the work entirely in the dry , except as specified below .
When conditions are encountered that render it impractical to dewater the cofferdam , the Engineer may require the placing of underwater concrete of such dimensions as will be necessary to allow the Contractor to complete the substructure in the dry .
The placement of underwater concrete shall comply with 6.01.03‑6 .
Cofferdams must be constructed to protect uncured masonry and concrete against damage from a sudden rising of the water and prevent damage to structure foundations by erosion .
No part of the cofferdam which extends into the substructure may be left in place without written permission from the Engineer .
At least 30 calendar days prior to the start of constructing or installing a cofferdam , the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer detailed plans and computations of its proposed cofferdam ( s ) prepared by a professional Engineer licensed in the State .
The furnishing of such plans and methods shall not serve to relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for the safety of the work and the successful completion of the Project .

If the Engineer requires the Contractor to construct an additional cofferdam not shown on the plans , or to enlarge a cofferdam beyond the dimensions of same as designated on the plans , or if the Engineer accepts the Contractor ’ s proposal to do so as being essential for the purposes of the Contract , the Department will revise the Contract to indicate those changes and to designate the revised dimensions of cofferdam deemed necessary by the Engineer .
If the total number of linear feet of any given cofferdam as designated in the revised Contract is greater than the quantity as designated on the original Contract plans , the Department will pay the Contractor for the revised quantity of such linear feet at the Contract unit price , subject to the provisions of 1.04.02 and 1.04.03 .
To the extent that the Engineer allows the addition or enlargement of a cofferdam for the convenience or other benefit of the Contractor , but does not deem that addition or enlargement essential for the performance of the Contract work , the Department will make no additional payment for the cofferdam or portion of the cofferdam which the Engineer does not so deem essential .
The Department will not in any event pay the Contractor for fewer linear feet of a cofferdam than were designated on the original Contract plans unless the Department eliminates that cofferdam in its entirety from the Contract .
Even if , however , the Contractor ’ s plan for an additional cofferdam or enlargement of a cofferdam deemed essential by the Engineer includes a previously‑existing structure , in no case will a previously‑existing natural or built structure , such as an abutment or an embankment , be measured for payment in calculating the revised number of linear feet of cofferdam on the Project .
Any common cofferdam wall required for staged construction will be measured for payment only once .
In no case will a given length or portion of cofferdam be measured for payment purposes more than once .

Mainline pavement is defined as all pavement for traffic lanes and climbing lanes , but excluding concrete base , acceleration and deceleration lanes , and all taper sections , pavement widening , shoulders , and side street returns .
Pavement on horizontal curves having a baseline radius of curvature of 6 degrees or greater and superelevation transitions of such curves will also be excluded .
The surface smoothness of pavement not classified as mainline pavement shall be determined by the Surface Test ( straightedge ) as described hereinafter .
The smoothness of the pavement surface will be determined by using a California Type Profilograph over each designated lane to develop a Profile Index .
The equipment shall be furnished and maintained by the Contractor , and will be operated by the Engineer in accordance with Department test methods .
The Contractor shall furnish paving equipment and employ methods that produce a riding surface having a Profile Index of 12 inches/mile , or less .
The profile will terminate 50 feet from each pressure relief joint or existing pavement which is joined by the new pavement .
Pavement profiles will be taken 3 feet from and parallel to each edge of pavement for pavement placed at a 12 foot width or less .
When pavement is placed at a greater width than 12 feet , the profile will be taken 3 feet from and parallel to each edge and at the approximate locations of each planned longitudinal joint .
Additional profiles may be 262 4.01.03 taken only to define the limits of an out of tolerance surface variation .
During the initial paving operations , either when starting up or after a long shut down period , the pavement surface will be tested with the profilograph as soon as the concrete has cured sufficiently to allow testing .
Membrane curing damaged during the testing operation shall be repaired by the Contractor as directed by the Engineer .
The purpose of this initial testing is to aid the Contractor and the Engineer in evaluating the paving methods and equipment .
Once the initial pavement smoothness , paving methods , and paving equipment are acceptable to the Engineer , the Contractor may proceed with the paving operation .
Subsequent to the aforementioned initial testing , daily profiles of each day ’ s paving will be run as soon as possible , preferably during the next working day following placement of the pavement .
A daily average Profile Index will be determined for each day ’ s paving .
A day ’ s paving is defined as a minimum of 1000 linear feet of full‑width pavement placed in a single day .
If less than 1000 linear feet is paved , the day ’ s production shall be grouped with the subsequent day ’ s production .
If an average Profile Index of 20 inches/mile is exceeded in any daily paving operation , the paving operation will be suspended and will not be allowed to resume until corrective action is taken by the Contractor .
In the event that paving operations are suspended as a result of the average Profile Index exceeding 20 inches/mile , subsequent paving operations will be tested in accordance with the initial paving testing procedures .
For the purpose of determining pavement sections where corrective work or pay adjustments will be necessary , the pavement will be evaluated in 0.1 mile sections .
Within each 0.1 mile section , all areas represented by high points with deviations in excess of 0.5 inch per 25 feet or less shall be removed by the Contractor with an approved grinding device or a device consisting of multiple saws .
The final texture of the concrete pavement shall be such that texture , appearance , and skid resistance are comparable to adjacent sections that do not require corrective work .
The use of a bush hammer or other impact device will not be permitted .
Deviations in excess of 0.5 inch will be determined from the profilogram in accordance with Department Test Methods .
After removing all individual deviations in excess of 0.5 inch per 25 feet , additional cutting shall be performed if necessary to reduce the Profile Index .
On those 0.1 mile sections where corrections are necessary , second profilograph runs will be performed to verify that corrections have produced an average Profile Index 20 inches/mile or less .
If the initial average Profile Index is less than 12 inches/mile , only the areas in excess of 0.5 inch deviations will be re‑profiled for correction verification .
After removing all individual deviations in excess of 0.5 inch , as stated above , additional correction shall be performed if necessary to reduce the average Profile Index to 20 inches/mile or less .
All corrective work shall be completed prior to determinations of pavement thickness .
2 .
Surface Test ( Straightedge ) and Corrections : As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently , the pavement surface , except as specified herein above for mainline pavement , shall be tested by the Contractor with an approved 10 foot straightedge placed both transversely and longitudinally to the centerline at sufficient intervals to check the surface profile .
Areas showing high spots of more than 1/8 inch , exclusive of tining corrugations , shall be marked by the Engineer and removed by the Contractor to an elevation where the area or spot will not show surface deviations in excess of 1/8 inch 263 4.01.04 when tested with a 10 foot straightedge .
Correction of surface irregularities and resulting surface finish shall meet the requirements specified herein for mainline pavement .
E. Flexural Testing of Concrete : The flexural strength of the concrete pavement shall be monitored by the evaluation of compressive strength cylinders .
The compressive strength specimens shall be cast and cured in the field in accordance with ASTM C31 .
After proper curing , these cylinders shall be transported to the Division of Materials Testing for strength evaluation .
F.� Opening�to�Traffic : Vehicular traffic shall be excluded from the pavement until sufficient curing has taken place .
The pavement shall be opened to traffic with the attainment of a compressive strength of 3,500 psi .
Any damage to the pavement from traffic or any other causes , occurring prior to acceptance of this Contract , shall be repaired by the Contractor at its own expense .
In order to expedite the opening of a pavement , or part thereof , to traffic , the Engineer may direct the Contractor to supply a concrete with a higher cement factor , or to substitute TYPE III Portland Cement for the type being used .
The mix design for this concrete must be approved by the Engineer .
The State will only pay the extra cost per ton for the cement used .
If the Contractor wants to increase the early strength of the pavement in order to facilitate its plan for the paving sequence , substitution of TYPE III Portland Cement , or use of a concrete with a higher cement factor may be allowed .
The mix design for these types of concrete must be approved by the Engineer .
The extra costs for the cement used shall be borne by the Contractor .
4.01.04—Method of Measurement : It is the intent of these specifications that the pavement shall be constructed strictly in accordance with the thickness and widths shown on the plans .
The State will not be liable for payment for any thickness and widths in excess of that required .
A .
Pay Adjustment for Surface Smoothness : Payment to the Contractor will be based on the average Profile Index per 0.1 mile section according to the following table : AVERAGE PROFILE INDEX CONTRACT UNIT PRICE ADJUSTMENT Inches per mile per 0.1‑mile section Percentage of pavement unit bid price 0 to 6 106 over 6 to 8 104 over 8 to 10 102 over 10 to 12 100 over 12 to 14 98 over 14 to 16 96 over 16 to 18 94 over 18 to 20 92 over 20 see below When the average Profile Index exceeds 12 inches/mile per 0.1 mile section , but does not exceed 20 inches/mile per 0.1 mile section , the Contractor may elect to accept a Contract unit price adjustment in lieu of reducing the average Profile Index .
The unit bid price adjustment will be computed using the designed thickness of Portland Cement pavement or as adjusted under 4.01.04 .
This unit bid price adjustment will apply 264 4.01.04 to the total area of the 0.1 mile long section for the lane width represented by the profile ( usually 12 feet wide ) .
No payment will be made for any pavement which has an average profile index in excess of 20 inches/mile until corrective work has been completed by the Contractor and the pavement re‑profiled to verify that the average Profile Index has been reduced to 20 inches/mile or less .
B .
Pay Adjustment for Pavement Thickness : 1 .
Determination of Pavement Thickness : The pavement thickness shall be measured after surface correction is completed .

Thickness measurements using cores tested in accordance with AASHTO T 148 shall remain the option of the Engineer .
The thickness of slip form pavement will be determined by average caliper measurements of cores tested in accordance with AASHTO T 148 .
For the purpose of establishing an adjusted unit price for pavement , units to be considered separately are defined at 1,000 lineal feet of pavement in each traffic lane starting at the end of the pavement bearing the smaller station number .
The last unit in each lane shall be 1,000 feet plus the fractional part of 1,000 feet remaining .
A core will be taken at random by the Department in each unit .
When the measurement of the core from a unit is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan thickness , full payment will be made .
When such measurement is deficient more than 0.2 inch and not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness , 2 additional cores at intervals not less than 300 feet will be taken and used in the average thickness for that unit .
If the average measurement of these 3 cores is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan thickness , full payment will be made .
If the average thickness of the 3 cores is deficient more than 0.2 inch , but not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness , an adjusted unit price as provided in 4.01.04‑B.2 will be paid for the area represented by these cores .
Other areas such as intersections , entrances , crossover ramps , etc. , will be considered as a single unit , and the thickness of each unit will be determined separately .
Small irregular unit areas may be included as part of another unit .
At such points as the Engineer may select in each unit , a core will be taken for each 1,000 s.y .
of pavement , or fraction thereof , in the unit .
If the core so taken is not deficient more than 0.2 inch from the plan thickness , full payment will be made .
If the core is deficient in thickness by more than 0.2 inch , but not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness , 2 additional cores will be taken from the area represented and the average of the 3 cores determined .
If the average thickness of the 3 cores is deficient more than 0.2 inch , but not more than 1.0 inch from the plan thickness , an adjusted unit price as provided in 4.01.04‑B.2 will be paid for the area represented by these cores .
In calculating the average thickness of the pavement , measurements that are in excess of the specified thickness by more than 0.2 inch will be considered as the specified thickness plus 0.2 inch , and measurements that are less than the specified thickness by more than 1.0 inch will not be included in the average .
When the measurement of any core is less than the specified thickness by more than 1.0 inch , the actual thickness of the pavement in this area will be determined by taking additional cores at ( not less than ) 10 foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction from the affected location until in each direction a core is found that is not 265 4.01.04 deficient by more than 1.0 inch .
Areas found deficient in thickness by more than 1.0 inch shall be evaluated by the Engineer , and if so judged that the deficient areas warrant removal , they shall be removed and replaced with concrete of the thickness shown on the plans .
Exploratory cores for deficient thickness will not be used in averages for adjusted unit price .
The cost of all thickness measurements made to determine average thickness variation or to isolate areas that are deficient by more than 1.0 inch , including filling holes with concrete , will be deducted from any monies due or that may come due to the Contractor under the Contract at the rate of $ 50.00 per core .

2 .
Prestressing : In all methods of tensioning , stress induced in the strands shall be determined by monitoring applied force and independently by measurement of elongation .
Applied force may be monitored by direct measurement using a pressure gauge piped into the hydraulic pump and jack system , dynamometer or load cell .
The 2 control measurements shall agree with their computed theoretical values , within a tolerance of ± 5 % .
If discrepancies are in excess of 5 % between the 2 calculated forces , determined by elongation measurement and gauge reading , the tensioning operation shall be suspended and the source of error determined and evaluated by qualified personnel before proceeding .
Additionally , the control measurements of force and elongation shall algebraically agree with each other within a 5 % tolerance .
If the measurements do not agree within 5 % , a load cell shall be added at the dead end and , if force measurements agree within 5 % between the gauge at a live end and the load cell at the dead end , the elongation agreement may be waived with permission from the Engineer .
After an initial force has been applied to the tendon , reference points for measuring elongation due to additional tensioning forces shall be established .

Pressure readings can be used directly if the calibration determines a reading is within a ±2 % tolerance of actual load .
Calibrations shall be performed at any time a tensioning system indicates erratic results and , in any case , at intervals not greater than 6 months .
Those producers using multiple strand tensioning systems may use a “ Master Gauge ” monitoring system for ongoing calibration of their systems after an initial calibration as a total system .
The producer shall have a master gauge calibrated every 6 months by an approved testing laboratory , calibration service or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer .
Production gauges shall be checked by plumbing the master gauge adjacent to the production gauge and recording pressures shown on both gauges throughout the normal operating range .
Should the difference in gauge pressures exceed 2 % , the production gauge shall be taken out of service .
This check shall be performed at any time a tensioning system indicates erratic results and , in any case , at intervals not greater than 6 months .
Pressure gauges or other measuring devices , such as digital readout , shall have a full range of measurement of 1 1/2 to 2 times their normal working pressure , whether for initial or final load .
Tensioning methods employing hydraulic gauges shall have appropriate bypass valve snubbers and fittings so that the gauge pointer will not fluctuate but will remain steady until the jacking load is released .
306 5.14.03 In all methods of pretensioning , the load shall be applied in 2 increments .
An initial load is applied to the individual strands to straighten them , eliminate slack , and provide a starting or reference point for measuring elongation .
The final load is then applied for which elongation of strands is computed and measured .
This method of operation shall be mandatory except as noted below in multiple strand tensioning .
Initial tensioning shall not exceed 15 % of the specified tensioning force , or 3,000 lb. , whichever is greater .
In single‑strand tensioning , the initial and final loads may be applied in immediate succession on each strand .

Elongations shall then be accurately measured from these reference points .
Elongations shall be measured as outlined hereinafter .
Elongation measurement shall take into account all operational losses and compensations in the tensioning system .
A .
Final Stressing of Straight Strands : ( 1 ) Single-strand tensioning : After application of the initial load and establishment of reference marks for measuring elongation , the full strand load shall be applied .
Loads indicated by gauging systems shall control the tensioning , with elongation checked on every strand .
An exception is the case of a completely open bed with no headers or other possible sources of friction .
In such instances , strand elongation shall be checked on only the first and last strands and 10 % of all others .
( 2 ) Multiple-strand tensioning : Following application of initial stress and seating of each strand on the anchorage header , reference marks shall be established for measuring elongation and slippage .
Reference marks for slippage shall be made by marking a straight line across the strands in each row along the face of the anchorage .
For uniform application of load to strands , the face of anchorage at final load must be in a plane parallel to its position under initial load .
Parallel movement shall be verified by measurement of movement on opposite sides of the anchorage and a check of its plumb position before and after application of the final load .
B .
Final Stressing of Draped Strands : Draped pretensioning strands may be finally stressed by any of the following methods : ( 1 ) Partial stressing and subsequent strains : In this method , the strands shall be tensioned in a straight position or on a partially draped trajectory to a predetermined , intermediate stress value between initial and final stress .
The final stress shall be induced by strains resulting from lifting or depressing strands at all other points of change in strand alignment .
Final position and stress shall be offset symmetrically about the center of the setup to distribute friction evenly .
Stress and elongation shall be measured as specified for the intermediate stress value .
Suitable stress measurements at each anchorage at each end of the bed shall verify calculated strand stresses within 5 % .
( 2 ) Final stressing in draped position : In this method the strands are stressed to final value in their draped position for the full length of the bed .
The strands shall pass over devices which effectively minimize friction at all deflection points .
Stress and elongation shall be measured as specified .
When final stressing is done by jacking strands from an end of the bed , even when 307 5.14.03 that tensioning is within tolerance , the force shall be measured on at least 2 strands at the far end .
This force shall not be below the theoretical values by more than 5 % .
If the theoretical elongation has not been attained at an end of the bed when the force , as indicated by pressure gauge or load cell , is exceeded by 5 % , the strand shall be jacked from the other end of the bed to the theoretical elongation .
If this requires an overstress as indicated by the gauge in excess of 5 % overload , the number of deflection points on the bed shall be reduced until the elongation can be attained with not more than 5 % overload or the hardware shall be improved to reduce friction .
Remaining deflection points shall then be achieved as outlined .
If elongation is not obtained within 5 % tolerance when theoretical force has been applied , the strand may be temporarily overstressed to overcome friction .
Overstress shall not exceed 80 % of the specified tensile strength of the strand .
Strands shall not be seated in this overstress condition .
Provision shall be made to reduce the force on the strand before anchorage .
Anchorage by seating of strand into chucks shall be done within 5 % tolerance of theoretical force .

In multiple strand detensioning , strands shall be released simultaneously by hydraulically releasing the jack .
The total force shall be taken from the header by the jack , then released gradually .
The overstress required to loosen lock nuts or other anchoring devices at the header shall not exceed the force in the strand by 5 % .
The maximum permissible time for holding tensioned strands in the bed before starting concrete placement is 36 hours .
Prestressing details that have been approved by the Engineer shall not be deviated from unless details of such deviations are approved in advance of use .

The bolts of the connection shall then be tightened in a similar manner as 348 6.03.03 necessary until the connection is properly tensioned .
Nuts shall be located , whenever practical , on the side of the connection which will not be visible from the traveled way .
Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer fastener assemblies shall be brought to full tension immediately following snugging .
Fully tensioned fastener assemblies shall not be reused .
Retightening previously tensioned bolts which may have been loosened by the tensioning of adjacent bolts shall not be considered as reuse .
Rotational‑Capacity Tests : In addition to the certified test reports , on‑Site Rotational‑capacity tests may be required by the Engineer .
This test shall be performed by the Contractor at the location where the fasteners are installed and tensioned .
When performed in the field , the procedure shall meet the requirements of ASTM A325 Appendix A‑1 .
Turn-of-Nut Installation Method : At the start of the work , the Contractor shall demonstrate that the procedure used by the bolting crew to develop a snug condition and to control the turns from a snug condition develops the tension required in Table A .
To verify their procedure , the Contractor shall test a representative sample of not less than 3 complete fastener assemblies of each diameter , length and grade to be used in the work .
This shall be performed at the start of work using a Skidmore .
Periodic retesting shall be performed when ordered by the Engineer .

When significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts , threads , nuts or washers , as determined by the Engineer , wrenches shall be recalibrated .
The Contractor shall verify during the installation of the assembled steel work that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from snug greater than that permitted in Table B .
If manual torque wrenches are used , nuts shall be turned in the tensioning direction when torque is measured .
When calibrated wrenches are used to install and tension bolts in a connection , bolts shall be installed with hardened washers under the element turned to tension the bolts .
Once the connection has been snugged , the bolts shall be tensioned using the calibrated wrench .
Tensioning shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to its free edges .
A calibrated torque wrench shall be used to “ touch up ” previously tensioned bolts which may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tensioning of adjacent bolts until all bolts are tensioned to the prescribed amount .

The load at this condition shall be recorded and the bolt removed from the tension‑measuring device .
The nut shall be able to be run down by hand for the complete thread length of the bolt 351 6.03.03 excluding thread run‑out .
If the nut can not be run down for this thread length , the DTI lot shall be rejected unless the load recorded is less than 95 % of the average load measured in the rotational capacity test of the fastener lot as specified previously in “ Rotational‑ Capacity Tests. ” If the bolt is too short to be tested in the calibration device , the DTI lot shall be verified on a long bolt in a calibrator to determine the number of refusals at the verification tension listed in Table C. The number of refusals shall not exceed the values listed under Maximum Verification Refusals in Table C. Another DTI from the same lot shall then be verified with the short bolt in a convenient hole in the work .
The bolt shall be tensioned until the 0.005 inch feeler gage is refused in all spaces and a visible gap exists in at least 1 space .
The bolt shall then be removed from the tension‑measuring device and the nut shall be able to be run down by hand for the complete thread length of the bolt excluding thread run‑out .

( c ) Mix Status : Each facility will have each type of bituminous concrete mixture evaluated based on the previous year of production , for the next construction paving season , as determined by the Engineer .
Based on the rating a type of mixture receives will determine whether the mixture can be produced without the completion of a Pre-Production Trial ( PPT ) .
Ratings will be provided to each bituminous concrete producer annually prior to the beginning of the paving season .
The rating criteria are based on compliance with Air Voids and Voids in Mineral Aggregate ( VMA ) as indicated in Table M.04.03-3 Superpave Master Range for Bituminous Concrete Mixture Production , and are as follows : Criteria A : Based on Air Voids .
Percentage of acceptance results with passing air voids .
Criteria B : Based on Air Voids and BMA .
The percentage of acceptance results with passing VMA , and the percentage of acceptance results with passing air voids , will be averaged .
The final rating assigned will be the lower of the rating obtained with Criteria A or Criteria B .
Ratings are defined as : “ A ” – Approved : A rating of “ A ” is assigned to each mixture type from a production facility with a current rating of 70 % passing or greater .
“ PPT ” – Pre-Production Trial : Rating assigned to each mixture type from a production facility when : 1. there are no passing acceptance production results submitted to the Department from the previous year ; 2. there is a source change in one or more aggregate components from the JMF on record by more than 10 % by weight ; 598 M.04.03 3. there is a change in RAP percentage ; 4. the mixture has a rating of less than 70 % from the previous season ; 5. it is a new JMF not previously submitted .
Bituminous concrete mixtures rated with a “ PPT ” can not be used on Department projects .
A passing “ PPT ” test shall be performed with NETTCP certified personnel on that type of mixture by the bituminous concrete producer and meet all specifications ( Tables M.04.02-2 to M.04.02-5 ) before production shipment may be resumed .
Contractors that have mix types rated as “ PPT ” may use one of the following three methods to change the rating to an “ A : ” Option A : Schedule a day when a Department inspector can be at the facility to witness a passing “ PPT ” test or , Option B : When the Contractor or their representative performs a “ PPT ” test without being witnessed by an inspector , the Contractor shall submit the test results and a split sample including 2 gyratory molds , 5,000 grams of boxed bituminous concrete , and 5,000 grams of cooled loose bituminous concrete for Gmm determination for verification testing and approval .
Passing verifications will designate the bituminous concrete type to be on an “ A ” status .
Failing verifications will require the contractor to submit additional trials .
Option C : When the Contractor or their representative performs a “ PPT ” test without being witnessed by a Department inspector , the Engineer may verify the mix in the Contractor ’ s laboratory .
Passing verifications will designate the bituminous concrete type to be an “ A ” status .
Failing verifications will require the Contractor to submit additional trials .
When Option A is used and the “ PPT ” test meets all specifications , the “ PPT ” test is considered a passing test and the rating for that mix is changed to “ A. ” When the “ PPT ” test is not witnessed , the “ PPT ” Option B or C procedure must be followed .
If the “ PPT ” Option B procedure is followed , the mixtures along with the test results must be delivered to the Materials Testing Lab .
The test results must meet the “ C ” tolerances established by the Engineer .
The tolerance Table is included in the Department ’ s current QA Program for Materials , Acceptance and Assurance Testing Policies and Procedures .
“ U ” – No Acceptable Mix Design on File : Rating assigned to a type of mixture that does not have a JMF submitted , or the JMF submitted has not been approved , or is incomplete .
A mix design or JMF must be submitted annually , at least 7 days prior to production in order to obtain an “ A , ” or “ PPT ” status for that mix .
A “ U ” will be used only to designate the mix status until the mix design has been approved , and is accompanied with all supporting data as specified .
Bituminous concrete mixtures with a “ U ” can not be used on Department projects .
