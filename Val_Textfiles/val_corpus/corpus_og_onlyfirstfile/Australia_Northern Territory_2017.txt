Carry out additional sweeping necessary to obtain a satisfactory clean surface by hand using stiff brass or similar brooms .
PREVIOUSLY SEALED AREAS Prior to the application of slurry surfacing mix adjoining previously sealed areas sweep the edges of the previously sealed areas to remove loose material for at least mm from the edge .
FOREIGN MATERIAL Remove adherent patches of foreign material from the surface of the road by steel scraper or other suitable methods .
Do not remove any large deposits of foreign material that can not be removed by reasonable use of the mechanical broom steel scrapers or other suitable methods .
Report the existence of any such deposits to the Superintendent prior to the commencement of spreading .
Hold point Do not commence spreading of the slurry surfacing mix until the prepared pavement has been endorsed by the Superintendent .
SET OUT Unless following a satisfactory edge line or centre line place pavement marks on the surface at intervals of not more than metres for the slurry surfacing machine to follow while mixing and spreading . .
APPLICATION Deposit the slurry surfacing mix at the optimum consistency into the spreading box and add nothing more to it .
Ensure that the mixing time is sufficient to produce a complete and uniform coating of the aggregate and direct the mixture into the moving spreader box at a sufficient rate to maintain an ample supply across the full width of the strikeoff squeegee at all times .
SLURRY BUILD UP If required squirt minor amounts of water into the corners of the spreader box to overcome temporary buildup of slurry surfacing mixture .
This has no detrimental effect on the performance of the slurry .
END OF RUN Square off the end of each run at the point where feathering commenced ie .
that point where there is insufficient material in the spreader box to maintain the full width of spread .
Alternatively the successive run may be lapped but by no more than mm if it can be demonstrated that no loss of riding surface or fattiness will result .
INACCESSABLE AREAS Use suitable hand squeegees to spread the mix in areas inaccessible to the machine .
JOINTS Make longitudinal joints coincide with lane or centreline markings .
Provide suitable width spreading equipment to produce a minimum number of longitudinal joints throughout the work .
Half passes and odd width passes may be used where necessary for shape correction but must not be used as the last pass of any paved area .
Do not allow excessive build up or unsightly appearance on longitudinal or traverse joints .
KERBS AND SHOULDERS Take care to ensure straight lines along kerbs and shoulders and do not allow run off on those areas .

WEED SPREAD PREVENTION .
Comply with the requirements of the Weeds Management Act .
Do not spread declared weeds by slashing .
For prevention of weed spread by machinery see the Standard Specification for Environmental Management .
While slashing does not kill weeds if done at the right time it can be an effective measure to reduce seed production especially in infested areas .
Slashing must be planned in conjunction with chemical control .
To reduce flowering of grassy weeds slash at end of rain season as stems are starting to elongate prior to seed maturity .
Slash from clean area to infested area Clean down slasher after working in infested area with leaf blower compressed air or high pressure water It is best practice to control isolated individual plants or clumps in otherwise clean areas with herbicide Most herbicides are absorbed more effectively through green leaves .
Previously slashed weeds may need time to grow green leaves before spraying .

There is a legal obligation to control all declared weeds under the Weeds Management Act see httpwww.lrm.nt.gov.auweedsfind for list .
For Class A declared weeds it is necessary to eradicate them for Class B it is necessary to prevent them from growing and spreading .
..
Treatment Program Hold Point Prepare a Weed Management Plan within weeks of commencement of the contract outlined in the Standard Specification for Environmental Management .
The Weed Management Plan must be signed off by both the Superintendent and Contractor and must refer directly to the Response Schedule and the Request for Tender and this specification .
SLASHING AND WEED CONTROL STANDARD SPECIFICATION FOR ROAD MAINTENANCE NTG REFERENCE TEXT DECEMBER Page Hold Point Submit a Weeds Management Plan for assessment and approval .
A Weed Management Plan is to set practical objectives for each road identified in the Response Schedule andor the RFT and be based on detailed maps of declared weeds present the scope of their infestations and the likelihood of seeds being spread e.g .
proximity to turn off areas .
For example in a road section with isolated individuals the objective might be that all plants are chemically controlled whereas in a core infestation slashing alone may be adequate to prevent weed spread and satisfy obligations under the Weeds Management Act .
Objectives need to be measurable so that effectiveness of control measures and spread prevention can be assessed .
Objectives should be discussed with the Superintendent in conjunction with DENR .
Address seasonal restrictions to weed reproductive cycles to prevent weed seeding .
DARWIN EAST ARNHEM AND KATHERINE REGIONS Time the operations to follow the first storms of the wet season andor before seeds are produced by the target plants .
Timing of seed production is variable depending on rainfall however some wood species eg .
Neem flower and produce seed in the dry season .
ALICE SPRINGS AND TENNANT CREEK REGION Rain can fall in both winter and summer in arid Australia .
Operations should be timed about weeks after a mm rainfall event for broad leaf or grassy weeds .
Woody weeds can be controlled all year round but the herbicide works better after rain .
.. Herbicide Selection Hold Point Hold Point Provide a list of herbicides and chemicals intended for use during the contract to the Superintendent as part of the Weed Management Plan .
Control declared weeds in the road reserve by spraying herbicides and additives as prescribed such as diesel or wetting agents surfactants .
Different herbicides have different modes of action which needs to be considered in selecting suitable herbicides and their application e.g .
foliar vs. basal bark .
Some disrupt the weeds metabolic processes killing the plants whereas others are residual in the soil and interfere with germinating seeds .
See the Department of Land Resource Management Weed Management Handbook httpsnt.gov.auenvironmentweedsweed managementhandbook for appropriate herbicides and application methods for most declared weeds .
For each declared weed species controlled log book records of chemical use should be kept .
Refer to .. Log Books and .. Log Books .
Chemical control should be planned in co ordination with slashing and burning requirements .
Provide an alternative suitable herbicide if during the course of the contract a chemical is withdrawn from the APVMA approved list .
..
Effectiveness of Control and Spread Prevention Effectiveness of control and spread prevention is assessed by a Permanent Monitoring Sites these are established by the Superintendent or his agent in strategic locations known to contain weeds point data and those known to be free of weeds transects at the commencement of the contract .
These will identify changes in weed infestations annually and over the entire period of the contract allow for verification against log books evaluate efficacy of the treatment slashing and chemical control help inform weed control priorities for the next season in conjunction with post season review include areas of known high density weed infestation and also areas known to be free from weeds at the commencement of the contract period .
Provide incentive for the contractor as a result of improved control over the duration of the contract .
b Overall visual assessment of road verge for monitoring according to submission of the log books .
c Specific monitoring for gamba grass control and spread management may be conducted in strategic areas .
..
Determination for Key Performance Indicators Evaluation of the monitoring points will occur at the conclusion of the treatment period wet season annually .
Assessment will be consistent with the WMB data collection requirements httpwww.lrm.nt.gov.auweedsmapping and will allow determination of a Key Performance Indicator KPI based on criteria listed below .
The KPI is linked to final payment schedule .
SLASHING AND WEED CONTROL STANDARD SPECIFICATION FOR ROAD MAINTENANCE NTG REFERENCE TEXT DECEMBER Page The KPI is calculated as the percentage of sites where values of or alive adult seeding gamba grass were recorded indicating that weeds were not managed .
