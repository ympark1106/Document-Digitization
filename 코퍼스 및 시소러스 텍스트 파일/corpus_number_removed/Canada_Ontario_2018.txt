Date OPSS Appendix A November FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS Note This is a nonmandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer during the design stage of a contract on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract .
This appendix does not form part of the standard specification .
Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owners design decisions and methodology .
Designer ActionConsiderations The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents Areas identified for clearing close cut clearing grubbing removal of surface boulders and removal of piled boulders and mechanical stump cutting in addition to those areas required by this specification. . Areas identified as being environmentally sensitive .
.. Areas for clearing and close cut clearing within Crown Land .
.. Areas where cut trees are to be stacked .
..
The areas where work is to be done in or near waterbodies or waterbody banks .
.. Review crown land clearing with Ministry of Natural Resources MNR to determine volume of marketable timber available .
.. Identify holders of sustainable forest licences and their addresses from the MNR and make them available to the Contractor .
..
Method of measurement for clearing close cut clearing and grubbing .
When surface boulders and piled boulders are to be removed that are outside the general grading limits the Removal of Surface Boulders and Removal of Piled Boulders items should be used .
Swamp excavation areas do not require grubbing therefore designers should not include a grubbing quantity in the Contract Documents for these areas .
The designer should include an additional quantity for individual boulders over m in the rock excavation quantity .
..
Mechanical stump cutting should be considered to avoid damage to adjacent structures that may result from grubbing .
Piled boulders greater than m should be designated for removal and be included for payment in the tender item for Removal of Piled Boulders regardless of where they are located .
The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents .

When greater gradation control is required of the final product full depth removal of the concrete pavement and offsite crushing is recommended .
All overlying bituminous material shall be fully removed prior to rubblizing .
Payment for removal of bituminous material shall be under separate items .
The designer should ensure that areas previously repaired with full depth asphalt are removed to ensure uniform performance of the rubblized material .
Proper subgrade support for the rubblizing operation shall be assessed during precontract engineering .
Granular A material for backfill purposes may be substituted with an alternate crushed granular material .
When paving directly on the rubblized surface a hot mix asphalt levelling course is recommended .
If an alternate material is required this must be indicated in the Contract Documents .
The designer should identify the thickness of the concrete slab to be rubblized and identify the type of embedded steel in the concrete slab .
Pavement drainage systems including ditch subdrains and outlets are to be staged so that they are installed and operational prior to rubblizing operations beginning .
Operations should be staged so that the lateral pavement edge support remains in place until the rubblizing operations are completed .
This is to ensure that the maximum impact energy is transferred to the concrete slab .
Since only construction traffic is permitted on the rubblized surface traffic staging should be shown in the Contract Documents .
The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents .

Date OPSS Appendix A November FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS Note This is a nonmandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer during the design stage of a contract on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract .
This appendix does not form part of the standard specification .
Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owners design decisions and methodology .
Designer ActionConsiderations This specification was written to encompass the majority of pipe bursting operations for small and medium sized projects .
However the basic design considerations should always include properly planned entry and exit points grade of existing host pipe adjacent Utilities and connection requirements .
The International Pipe Bursting Association IPBA normally assigns pipe bursting work to one of three classifications .
These following classifications January version are intended for use as general guidelines when considering replacement of existing pipe by pipe bursting techniques .
The classification should be determined based on the more stringent parameter in the table below .
IPBA Classification and Degree of Difficulty Depth of Pipe m Existing Pipe Diameter mm New Pipe Diameter Options Burst Length m Original Trench Width Soil Type A Minimal .
Size on Size Relatively wide trench compared to expander head outside diameter .
Compressible soils outside trench loose sand gravel soft clay .
B Moderate .
to .
Single Upsize Trench width less than wider than the expander head outside diameter .
Moderately compressible soils outside trench medium dense to dense sand medium to stiff clay .
C Comprehensive .
Double Triple Upsize Incompressible soils outside trench .
Constricted trench geometry width less than or equal to outside diameter of bursting head .
D Developmental The designer may consider a prequalification process to ensure that the contractors possess the required capabilities and qualifications to undertake the work required under the contract .
The designer should include the following in the Contract Documents Page Rev .
Date OPSS Appendix A Pipe type class pressure rating and size .
..
Valve type class pressure rating and size .
..
Product ovality .
.. Service connection work .
Benching restoration .
..

..
Product bypass .
..
Joining and pulling product as one length .
Use of a weak link breakway connector or load monitor .
.. Wall restoration .
..
Completion of a CCTV inspection .
..
The designer should give consideration in consultation with the pipe manufacturer to minimum allowable product bending radii commensurate with the pipelines strength .
The designer should give special consideration to the required grades at the entry and exit points .
The designer may undertake a CCTV inspection and location analysis prior to pipe bursting to review the existing line and grade to determine if deviations are acceptable .
Product upsizing by using a pipe bursting technique may induce stresses in the surrounding soil resulting in potential damage to nearby Utilities and foundations .
The degree of distortion on the zone of influence is a function of the degree of upsizing the pipe material of a nearby Utility the location of nearby Utilities in relation to the pipe burst pipe and the soil conditions .
The designer may consider exposure of critical services by nondestructive methods to monitor the pipe bursting progress and impacts .
The designer should consider the need for product bypass temporary potable water supply services or temporary flow stoppage or blockage with inflatable plugs during the pipe bursting operation .
The designer may require that during the execution of the work the flow shall be bypassed around the product being replaced and the continuity of service to each facility connected to the affected section of product be maintained .
The designer should consider what should be done if there is an extended service disruption .
Page Rev .
Date OPSS Appendix A For certain product installations the designer may consider the requirement of a weak link breakaway connector or load monitor to prevent excess pulling force from damaging the product .
The designer should consider the type of interface and the degree of continuity between the product and the existing structure to ensure appropriate anchoring and seals in order to prevent product retraction or inadvertent leaks to the new system .
The designer may specify the completion of a CCTV inspection of the product after installation particularly when grade thresholds are critical .
In smaller diameter product installations when the designer elects to complete a CCTV survey the designer may wish to specify a lighter interior colour of the product installation if available .
Testing of product joining and installation may include hydrostatic air BACTT etc .
Verification record requirements may include such information as reporting information available from the pipe bursting machine daylighting installation of tracer wire with the product the use of acoustic or magnetic locating equipment etc .
Acceptance criteria requirements may include such considerations as successful bursting operation from entry to pull back location CCTV inspection removal of extra coupon pipe length from the pull back pit to view for stresses grade verification etc .
The designer may consider including a process regarding payment for failed pipe bursting attempts in the Contract Documents .
The tender item description for Product Installation by Pipe Bursting should include reference to one or more of the attributes shown i.e .
type of product diameter of product and use of product to be complete .
The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents .
