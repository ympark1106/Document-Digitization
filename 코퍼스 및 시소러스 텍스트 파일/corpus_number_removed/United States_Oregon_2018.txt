It is essential and in the public interest that the Contractor prosecute the Work vigorously to Contract completion and within Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time .
The Agency does not waive any rights under the Contract by permitting the Contractor to continue to perform the Contract or any part of it after the Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time has expired .
b Liquidated Damages Delays in the Contractors performance of the Work will cause the Agency to sustain damages increase risk to inconvenience and interfere with the traveling public and commerce and increase costs to taxpayers .
Because the Agency finds it is unduly burdensome and difficult to demonstrate the exact dollar value of such damages the Contractor agrees to pay to the Agency not as a penalty but as liquidated damages the amounts determined as specified below for each Calendar Day the Work remains incomplete after the expiration of the Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time applicable to that Work .
The liquidated damages shall constitute payment in full only of damages incurred by the Agency due to the Contractors failure to complete the Work on time .
Payment by the Contractor of liquidated damages does not release the Contractor from its obligation to fully and timely perform the Contract according to its terms .
Nor does acceptance of liquidated damages by the Agency constitute a waiver of the Agencys right to collect any additional damages it may sustain by reason of the Contractors failure to fully perform the Contract according to its terms .
If the Contract is terminated according to .a and if the Work has not been completed by other means on or before the expiration of Contract Time or adjusted Contract Time liquidated damages will be assessed against the Contractor for the duration of time reasonably required to complete the Work .
Single Contract Time The liquidated damages per Calendar Day for failure to complete the Work on time as required by .h when a single Contract Time is listed under .h will be established using the following formula The Liquidated Damages per Calendar Day are .
percent of C divided by T as defined in this Section .
C The Contractors Bid amount for the Contract .
T The total Calendar Days between the latest completion date or time listed under .h in the Solicitation Documents and the Bid Opening that will result in the greatest value for T. Calendar Day amounts are applicable when the Contract Time is expressed on the Calendar Day or fixed date basis .
Multiple Contract Times The liquidated damages per Calendar Day for failure to complete the Work on time as required by .h when multiple Contract Times are listed under .h will be established for each individual Contract Time as follows .
The Agencydetermined percentage of the value of all Work required to be complete by a given Contract Time multiplied by the rate determined using the formula specified in .b .
When multiple Contract Times are listed under .h the Agencydetermined percentages of the value of Work required to be complete by the Contract Times listed under .h will be listed in the Special Provisions .
If liquidated damages should become payable concurrently under any combination of liquidated damage rates the rate that will be assessed will be the highest applicable rate .
Calendar Day amounts are applicable when the Contract Time is expressed on the Calendar Day or fixed date basis . .

Provisions and Requirements .
Payment For Changes in Materials Costs On certain projects as identified in the Special Provisions an escalationdeescalation clause with respect to certain materials will be in effect during the life of the Contract. . Steel Material Price EscalationDeEscalation Clause Subsections .
.a .b .c and .d contain the price escalationdeescalation clause relating to steel materials as defined in .d that is included in this Contract .
This exclusive steel material price escalationdeescalation clause and the steel escalationdeescalation program described in .
through .d are in effect for the life of this Contract regardless of the number of steel material Pay Items if any that are included and whether or not the Contractor elects to participate in the steel escalationdeescalation program according to .d .
a Steel Material Price EscalationDeEscalation Participation The Contractor may select individual Pay Items to include in the steel escalationdeescalation program from those Pay Items listed for this Project under .d by following the directions provided in .d .
The Contractor is not obligated to select any Pay Items .
Before or within business days after the date of the preconstruction conference the Contractor shall submit in writing to the Project Manager the Pay Items selected by the Contractor to be included in the steel escalationde escalation program in the manner required under .d .
If the Contractor fails to inform the Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel escalationdeescalation program in the manner and within the time limits stated in .d or the Contractor otherwise elects not to participate in the program the Contractor thereby elects not to participate in the program and forfeits all present and future rights to participate in the program for this Project .
The Agency reserves all of its rights under the Contract including but not limited to its rights for suspension of the Work under .
and its rights for termination of the Contract under .
and this steel material price escalationdeescalation provision will not limit those rights .
Adjustment for fluctuations in the cost of steel material will apply only to the Pay Items individually selected by the Contractor from the Pay Items listed under .d and will be made using the respective steel cost basis CB listed. . b Monthly Steel Materials Value MV and Base Steel Materials Value BV The Monthly Steel Materials Value MV will be established by the Agency from the IDWPUSISTEEL Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS Producer Price Indexes PPI using nonseasonally adjusted indexes only .
Preliminary numbers may be referenced on the IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI for months or more before IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI determines they are final numbers .
The Base Steel Materials Value BV for this Project will be the MV published on the ODOT Estimating website see .e for the month of the Bid Opening for this Project .
The Agency will only publish values on the ODOT Estimating website for use after the IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI establishes the numbers as final numbers .
The final values of MV and BV will be available at the ODOT Estimating website .
The Agency has no control of when the IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI establishes final values .
The Agency steel material price escalationdeescalation adjustments made under .
through .d may not be reflected on payments made to the Contractor for up to months after the IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI applicable values become final .
This timing for steel material price escalationdeescalation adjustments is an agreed term of this Contract and shall not constitute late payment under ORS C. nor shall the Agency be responsible to pay interest on any such steel material price adjustments .
If the Agencyselected index ceases to be available for any reason the Agency in its discretion will select and begin using a substitute price source or index to establish the MV each month .
The MV will only apply to Pay Items selected by the Contractor and provided in writing to the Project Manager from the Pay Item list contained under and in the manner and within the time limits required by .d .
The Agency does not guarantee that steel material will be available at any stated or implied materials price .
c Monthly Steel Materials Price Adjustment If the Contractor has properly informed the Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel escalationdeescalation program as required by .a and .d a price adjustment evaluation will be made for the Pay Items individually selected .
No adjustments will be made using the BV or MV until such time as they are listed as final values by the IDWPUSISTEEL BLS PPI .
The price adjustment as calculated in this provision for a given Pay Item will use the MV for the month the Work associated with that Pay Item is performed and added to the monthly progress estimate .
A price adjustment for that Pay Item will only be made if the MV for the month the Work associated with the Pay Item is performed and added to the monthly progress estimate differs by more than from the BV .
A price adjustment will be made as and when required by .
through .d only for the Pay Items if any that were selected by the Contractor in the manner and within the time limits required under .a and .d .
The Monthly Steel Materials Price Adjustment will be determined as follows If the MV is within of the BV there will be no adjustment .
If the MV is more than of the BV then PA MVBV BV .
x CB x PIP If the MV is less than of the BV then PA MVBV BV .
x CB x PIP Where PA Price Adjustment dollars MV Monthly Steel Materials Value from BLS PPI for the month determined above after becomes final BV Base Steel Materials Value from month of the Bid Opening after becomes final PIP Amount paid for the Pay Item for the month for which the adjustment is made CB Cost Basis for the applicable steel material in percent see .d .
d Steel Materials Pay Item Selection The Agency has a process using estimated quantities to determine which Pay Items containing steel material qualify for the steel escalationde escalation program by meeting a minimum threshold and are therefore included in the eligible Pay Items listed in the Special Provisions .
For purposes of .
through .d steel material means structural and reinforcing steel steel studs sheet piling guardrail ductile iron pipe and other steel products used for the construction reconstruction or major renovation of a road or Highway .
The Contractor may elect to participate in the steel escalationdeescalation program for this Project by marking the list in the Special Provisions checking each box next to each Pay Item the Contractor wants included in the program and submitting this information in writing signed and dated by the Contractor to the Project Manager before or within Calendar Days after the date of the preconstruction conference .
The steel material price escalationdeescalation clause for price adjustments for fluctuations in the cost of steel material will apply only to the Pay Items selected by the Contractor from the Pay Item list included in the Special Provisions and provided in writing to the Project Manager in the manner and within the time limits stated above .
If the Contractor fails to inform the Project Manager of Pay Items to include in the steel escalationdeescalation program in the manner and within the time limits stated above or the Contractor otherwise elects not to participate in the program the Contractor thereby elects not to participate in the program and forfeits all present and future rights to participate in the program for this Contract and this Project. . Changes to Plans or Character of Work a Insignificant Changed Work If the changes made under .
do not significantly change the character or unit cost of the Work to be performed under the Contract the Agency will pay for such Work at the Pay Item price .
If the Work involved in the change is measured on a lump sum basis and its character is not significantly changed payment for the Changed Work will be determined As described in the applicable Section of the Specifications If not described there on a theoretical unit price determined by dividing the Contractors lump sum price by the estimated quantity of the Pay Item listed in the Special Provisions or If neither of the above apply the Engineer will make an equitable adjustment .
b Significant Changed Work If the changes made under .
significantly alter the character unit cost or lump sum cost of the Work the Agency will adjust the Contract .
Adjustments will exclude any loss of anticipated profits .
The parties shall agree upon the basis for payment and the amount of adjustment prior to the Contractor commencing the Changed Work .
If the basis and amount can not be agreed upon the Engineer will make an equitable adjustment which may increase or decrease the Contract Amount and Contract Time .
Any such adjustments may be less than but will not be more than the amount justified by the Engineer on the basis of the established procedures set out in Section for determining rates .
This does not limit the application of Section .
The term Significant Changed Work shall apply only to that circumstance in which the character of the Work as changed differs materially in kind nature or unit cost from that involved or included in the originally proposed construction .
. .
Differing Site Conditions Upon written notification as required in .
the Engineer will investigate the identified conditions .
If the Engineer determines that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required to perform any Work under the Contract an adjustment in the Contract Amount or Contract Time excluding loss of anticipated profits will be made and the Contract modified accordingly in writing .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor as to whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
No Contract adjustment which benefits the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
Any such adjustments will be made according to .. .
Unreasonable Delay by the Agency If the Contractor believes that performance of all or any portion of the Work is suspended delayed or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time in excess of that originally anticipated or customary in the construction industry due to acts or omissions of the Agency or persons acting for the Agency and that additional compensation Contract Time or both are due the Contractor because of the suspension delay or interruption the Contractor shall immediately file a written notice of delay according to ..
The Contractor shall then promptly submit a properly supported request for any additional compensation Contract Time or both according to the applicable provisions in .
through .
and Section .
The Engineer will promptly evaluate a properly submitted request for additional compensation .
If the Engineer determines that the delay was unreasonable and that the cost required for the Contractor to perform the Contract has increased as a result of the unreasonable suspension delay or interruption the Engineer will make an equitable adjustment excluding profit and modify the Contract in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination and whether an adjustment to the Contract is warranted .
Under this provision no Contract adjustment will be allowed Unless the Contractor has provided the written notice required by .
For costs incurred more than Calendar Days before the Engineer receives the Contractors properly submitted written request For any portion of a delay that the Engineer deems to be a reasonable delay or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded under other terms of the Contract or To the extent that performance would nevertheless have been suspended delayed or interrupted by causes other than those described in this Subsection. . Progress Payments and Retained Amounts a Progress Payments The Agencys payment of progress payments or determination of satisfactory completion of Pay Items or Work or release of retainage under .d shall not be construed as Final Acceptance or approval of any part of the Work and shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defective Materials or workmanship or for latent defects and warranty obligations .
The estimates upon which progress payments are based are not represented to be accurate estimates .
All estimated quantities are subject to correction in the final estimate .
If the Contractor uses these estimates as a basis for making payments to Subcontractors the Contractor assumes all risk and bears any losses that result .
If the estimated amount due the Contractor for any given month is less than the Agency will make no payment for that month unless requested by the Contractor. . Progress Estimates At the same time each month the Engineer will make an estimate of the amount and value of Pay Item Work completed .
The amount of Work completed will be the sum of the estimated number of units completed for unit price Pay Items plus the estimated percentage completed of lump sum Pay Items .
The estimated value of the Work completed will then be determined by using the Contract unit price for unit price Pay Items and by using one of the following methods to determine the value of the lump sum Pay Items The theoretical unit price when the Special Provisions contain an estimated number of units A Contractorsubmitted Engineerapproved Schedule of Values when there is no theoretical unit price available or Engineers determination when there is neither an available theoretical unit price nor an approved Contractorsubmitted Schedule of Values .
The amounts to be allowed for lump sum Pay Items in progress payments will not exceed the reasonable value of the Work performed as determined by the Engineer .
Incidentals such as formwork falsework shoring and cribbing shall be included in the unit prices for the various Pay Items requiring their use unless specified as a separate Pay Item .
No payment will be made for Pay Items that include Incidentals until units or portions of such Pay Item Work are in place and completed .
The costs of Incidentals will be paid in proportion to the percentage of Pay Item Work completed .
Value of Materials on Hand The Engineer will also make an estimate of the amount and value of acceptable Materials on hand i.e .
already delivered and stored according to .a to be incorporated into the Work .
Value of Work Accomplished The sum of the values in and above will be collectively referred to in this Subsection as the value of Work accomplished subject to below .
Limitations on Value of Work Accomplished In determining the value of Work accomplished the Engineers estimate will be based on the unit prices for the various Pay Items .
Any amounts not included in progress payments due to substantial mathematical unbalancing of Pay Item prices will be included in the final payment issued according to .b .
Reductions to Progress Payments With each progress payment the Contractor will receive a Contract payment voucher and summary setting forth the value of Work accomplished reduced by the following Amounts previously paid Amounts deductible or owed to the Agency for any cause specified in the Contract Additional amounts retained to protect the Agencys interests according to Subsection e below .
b Retainage The amount to be retained from progress payments will be .
of the value of Work accomplished and will be retained in one of the forms specified in Subsection c below .
If the Agency determines that satisfactory progress is not being made on the Work the Agency may withhold up to of the value of Work accomplished from subsequent progress payments .
No retainage will be withheld from Work performed as Force Account Work escalationde escalation bonuses or other items decided by the Agency. . As provided in .a additional retainage of of amounts earned will be withheld and released according to ORS C. when the Contractor fails to file the certified statements required in ORS C. FHWA Form and .. c Forms of Retainage Forms of acceptable retainage are specified below in Subsections through .
Cash Alternate A is the Agencypreferred form of retainage .
If the Agency incurs additional costs as a result of the Contractors election to use a form of retainage other than Cash Alternate A the Agency may recover such costs from the Contractor by a reduction of the final payment .
Cash Alternate A Retainage will be deducted from progress payments and held by the Agency until final payment is made according to .
unless otherwise specified in the Contract .
The Agency will deposit the cash retainage withheld in an interestbearing account in a bank savings bank trust company or savings association for the benefit of the Agency as provided by ORS C .. Interest earned on the account shall accrue to the Contractor .
Amounts retained and interest earned will be included in the final payment made according to .. Any retainage withheld on Work performed by a Subcontractor will be released to the Contractor according to .d .
Cash Alternate B Retainage Surety Bond Upon receipt of an approved retainage surety bond the Agency will limit the amount of cash retainage withheld to .
The surety bond must be in the bond form provided by the Agency .
The bond must be provided by the same Surety that provides the Performance and Payment Bonds .
If the Contractor elects this form of retainage the Agency will withhold from progress payments up to .
of the value of the Work accomplished as cash retainage until the retained amount equals .
After that amount is retained no further cash retainage will be withheld until the additional required retainage that would have been withheld exceeds the face amount of the retainage surety bond provided .
Thereafter retainage will be withheld from progress payments according to these Specifications .
According to .b if at any time the Agency determines that satisfactory progress is not being made on the Work the Agency may withhold up to of the value of the Work accomplished from subsequent progress payments .
If an acceptable retainage surety bond is provided the Contractor shall notify all Subcontractors of the existence of the retainage surety bond and shall advise them of their rights under ORS C. and ORS ..
Amounts of retainage withheld under the provision will be included in the final payment according to .. Any retainage withheld on Work performed by a Subcontractor shall be released to the Contractor according to .d .
Bonds Securities and Other Instruments In accordance with ORS C. unless the Agency finds in writing that accepting a bond security or other instrument poses an extraordinary risk that is not typically associated with the bond security or other instrument the Agency will approve the Contractors written request to deposit bonds securities or other instruments with the Agency or in a custodial account or other account satisfactory to the Agency with an approved bank or trust company to be held instead of cash retainage for the benefit of the Agency .
In such event the Agency will reduce the cash retainage by an amount .
equal to the value of the bonds securities and other instruments .
Interest or earnings on the bonds securities and other instruments shall accrue to the Contractor .
Bonds securities and other instruments deposited instead of cash retainage shall be assigned to or made payable to the Agency and shall be of a kind approved by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services including but not limited to Bills certificates notes or bonds of the United States Other obligations of the United States or agencies of the United States Obligations of a corporation wholly owned by the federal government Indebtedness of the Federal National Mortgage Association General obligation bonds of the State of Oregon or a political subdivision of the State of Oregon Irrevocable letters of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS ..
The Contractor shall execute and provide such documentation and instructions respecting the bonds securities and other instruments as the Agency may require to protect its interests .
When the Engineer determines that all requirements for the protection of the Agencys interest have been fulfilled the bonds and securities deposited instead of cash retainage will be released to the Contractor .
d Release of Retainage As the Work progresses release of the amounts retained under b above will only be considered for Pay Items that have been satisfactorily completed .
For purposes of this Subsection a Pay Item will be considered satisfactorily completed only if all of the Work for the Pay Item is complete and all contractual requirements pertaining to the Pay Item and Work have been satisfied .
Work not included in a Pay Item or which constitutes part of an uncompleted Pay Item will not be regarded as satisfactorily completed Work for the purposes of this Subsection .
Beginning with the fourth month after First Notification and every third month thereafter the Agency will release retainage for satisfactorily completed Pay Items in the Schedule of Items or for satisfactorily completed Pay Items added by Contract Change Order .
Retainage will be released with the scheduled progress payment for the fourth month after First Notification and with the scheduled progress payment for each third month thereafter .
Within Calendar Days of receipt of retainage the Contractor shall pay to each Subcontractor all such released retainage that pertains to the Work of that Subcontractor .
A determination of satisfactory completion of Pay Items or Work or release of retainage shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the Work and shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defective Materials or workmanship or for latent defects and warranty obligations .
e Withholding Payments The Engineer may withhold such amounts from progress payments or final payment as may reasonably protect the Agencys interests until the Contractor has Complied with all orders issued by the Engineer according to the Specifications and Satisfied all legal actions filed against the Agency the Agencys governing body and its members and Agency employees that the Contractor is obliged to defend .

If there are any spaces between the direct tension indicator protrusions that do not refuse entry to a . inch feeler gauge reinspect all bolts retighten bolts in the joint as required and resubmit the joint for inspection .
TurnofNut Method When all turnofnut tightening activities have been witnessed and are acceptable by the Inspector no additional bolt tightening inspection is required .
If turnofnut tightening has been performed without being witnessed by the Inspector use the following inspection procedure In the presence of the Engineer use an inspection wrench which may be a calibrated torque wrench .
Place three bolts of the same grade diameter and condition as those under inspection individually in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Use a hardened washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt .
Tighten each bolt specified in the paragraph above in the calibration device by any convenient means to an initial condition equal to percent of the required tension and then to a tension not less than percent greater than specified for its size in Table in Section .
Tightening beyond the initial condition shall not produce greater nut rotation than .
times that allowed in Table in Section .
Then apply the inspecting wrench to the tightened bolt and determine the torque necessary to turn the nut or head degrees approximately inch at inches radius in the tightening direction .
Take the average torque measured in the tests of three bolts as the job inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in the next paragraph. . Test bolts that have been tightened in the Structure and are represented by the sample prescribed above with the inspecting wrench .
Apply the job inspecting torque to percent of the bolts but not less than two bolts selected at random .
If no nut or bolt head is turned by this application of the job inspecting torque the connection will be accepted as properly tightened .
If any nut or bolt head is turned by the application of the job inspecting torque test all bolts in the connections .
Retighten all bolts whose nut or head is turned by the job inspecting torque and reinspect .
