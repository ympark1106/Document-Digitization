If the Department accepts the VECP the Department and the Contractor will equally divide the net savings or Contract time or both .
When an accepted VECP includes Contract time savings onehalf of such time savings shall be used to reduce the Contract time and the remaining onehalf of such time savings shall be used exclusively by the Contractor as extra time .
The Contractor shall identify in the SOR a VECP contractor ﬂoat activity for each accepted VECP that includes Contract time savings .
The VECP extra time may be used by the Contractor to mitigate its delays on the project. . Each VECP shall result in a net savings over the Contract cost or Contract time or both with out impairing essential functions and characteristics of the items or of any other part of the project including but not limited to service life reliability economy of operation ease of maintenance aesthetics and safety .
At least the following information shall be submitted with each VECP Statement that the proposal is submitted as a VECP .
Statement concerning the basis for the VECP beneﬁts to the Department and an itemization of the pay items and requirements affected by the VECP .

Unless speciﬁcally provided for in the change order authorizing the VECP acceptance of the VECP and performance of the work thereunder will not change the Contract time limit .
The Department may adopt a VECP for general use in contracts the Department administers if it determines that the VECP is suitable for application to other contracts .
VECPs identical with or similar to previously submitted VECPs will be eligible for consideration and compensation under these provisions if the Department has not previously adopted the VECPs for general application to other contracts the Department administers .
When a VECP is adopted for gen eral use compensation pursuant to these requirements will be applied only to those awarded contracts for which the VECP was submitted prior to the date of adoption of the VECP . .
Proposed changes in the basic design of a bridge or pavement type or those changes that require different right of way limits will not normally be considered an acceptable VECP .
If a VECP is based on or is similar to a change in the plans Speciﬁcations or Special Provisions the Depart ment has adopted prior to submission of the VECP the Engineer will not accept the VECP .
The Engineer will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a VECP .
The requirements herein apply to each VECP initiated developed and identiﬁed as such by the Contractor at the time of its submission to the Engineer .
However nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Engineer to approve a VECP .
Subject to the provisions herein the Department or any other public agency shall have the right to use all or part of an accepted VECP without obligation or compensation of any kind to the Contractor .
If the Department accepts a VECP Section .b herein which pertains to the adjustment of Contract unit prices attributable to alterations of Contract quantities will not apply to the items adjusted or deleted as a result of putting the VECP into effect by a change order .

Speciﬁc methods of measurement shall be as indicated in the speciﬁc Section for the Contract item .
Longitudinal measurements for surface area computations will be made along the surface and transverse measurements will be the surface measure shown on the plans or ordered in writing by the Engineer .
Individual areas of obstructions with a surface area of square feet or less will not be deducted from surface areas measured for payment .
Structures will be measured in accordance with the neat lines shown on the plans .
Items that are measured by the linear foot will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which they are placed. . Allowance will not be made for surfaces placed over an area greater than that shown on the plans or for any material moved from outside the area of the crosssection and lines shown on the plans .
When standard manufactured items are speciﬁed and are identiﬁed by weights or dimensions such identiﬁcation will be considered nominal .
Unless more stringently controlled by toleranc es in cited speciﬁcations manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted .
b Measurement by Weight Materials that are measured or proportioned by weight shall be weighted on accurate scales as speciﬁed in this Section .
When material is paid for on a tonnage basis personnel performing the weighing shall be certiﬁed by the Department and shall be bond ed to the Commonwealth of Virginia in the amount of for the faithful observance and performance of the duties of the weighperson required herein .
The bond shall be executed on a form having the exact wording as the Weighpersons Surety Bond Form furnished by the Depart ment and shall be submitted to the Department prior to the furnishing of the tonnage material .
The Contractor shall have the weighperson perform the following .

Submit by the end of the next working day a summary of the number of loads and total weights for each type of material by Contract .
Trucks used to haul material shall be equipped with a cover suitable to protect the material and to protect the traveling public .
The truck tare to be used in the weighing operation shall be the weight of the empty truck de termined with full tanks of fuel and the operator seated in the cab .
The tare weight of trucks shall be recorded to the nearest pounds .
At the option of the Contractor a new tare may be determined for each load .
When a new tare is obtained for each load the requirement for full tanks of fuel will be waived .
Net rail shipment weights may be used for pay quantities when evidenced by railroad bills of lading .
However such weights will not be accepted for pay quantities of materials that subse quently pass through a stationary mixing plant .
Scales shall conform to the requirements for accuracy and sensitivity as set forth in the Nation al Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook No .
for Speciﬁcation Tolerances and Requirements for Commercial and Weighing Devices .
Scales used in the weighing of materials paid for on a tonnage basis shall be approved and sealed in accordance with the requirements of the policies of the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services or other approved agencies at least once every six months and upon being moved .
Hopper and truck scales shall be serviced and tested by a scale service representative at least once every six months .
Hopper scales shall be checked with a minimum pounds of test weights and truck scales shall be checked with a minimum pounds of test weights . .
Copies of scale test reports shall be maintained on ﬁle at the scale location for at least months and copies of all scale service representative test reports shall be forwarded to the Department .
The quantity of materials paid for on a tonnage basis shall be determined on scales equipped with an automatic printer .
Truck scale printers shall print the net weight and either the gross or tare weight of each load .
Hopper scale printers shall print the net weight of each load .
The weigh ticket shall also show the legal gross weight for material weighed on truck scales and the legal net weight for material weighed on hopper scales .
If the automatic printer becomes inoperative the weighing operation may continue for hours provided satisfactory visual veriﬁcation of weights can be made .
The written permission of the District Materials Engineer shall be required for the operation of scales after hours .
If signiﬁcant discrepancies are discovered in the printed weight the ultimate weight for pay ment will be calculated on volume measurements of the materials in place and unit weights determined by the Engineer or by other methods deemed appropriate to protect the interests of the Commonwealth .
c Measurement by Cubic Yard Material that is measured by the cubic yard loose measurement or vehicular measurement shall be hauled in approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of delivery .
Material measured in vehicles except streambed gravel silt clea nout or other selfconsolidating material will be allowed at the rate of the volume of the vehicle .
The full volume of the vehicle will be allowed for streambed gravel .
Such vehicles may be of any size or type acceptable to the Engineer provided the body is of such shape that the actual contents can be readily and accurately determined .
Unless all approved vehicles are of uniform capacity each vehicle shall bear a plainly legible identi ﬁcation mark indicating the speciﬁc approved capacity .
Each vehicle shall be loaded to at least its water level capacity .
When approved by the Engineer in writing material speciﬁed to be measured by the cubic yard may be weighed and such weights converted to cubic yards for payment purposes .
Factors for conversion from weight to volume measurement will be determined by the Engineer and shall be agreed to by the Contractor before they are used .
d Measurement by Lump Sum When used as an item of payment the term lump sum will mean full payment for completion of the corrrsponding item of work described in the Contract .
When a complete structure or structural unit is speciﬁed as a Contract item the unit of mea surement will be lump sum and shall include all necessary ﬁttings and accessories .
The quanti ties may be shown on the plans for items for which lump sum is the method of measurement .
If shown the quantities are approximate and are shown for estimating purposes only and no mea surement of quantities will be made for payment .
Items that are to be measured as complete units will be counted by the Inspector in the presence of a representative of the Contractor .
e Measurement for Speciﬁc Materials .
Concrete Measured by Volume Measure Concrete will be measured and computed by dividing the work into simple geometrical ﬁgures and adding their volumes . .
Concrete Measured by Square or Lineal Measure Concrete will be measured and computed by dividing the work into simple geometrical ﬁgures and adding their areas or measuring linearly along the items surface .
. . Excavation embankment and borrow In computing volumes of excavation embank ment and borrow methods having general acceptance in the engineering profession will be used .
When the measurement is based on the crosssectional area the average end area method will be used. . Asphalt Asphalt will be measured by the gallon volumetric measurement based on a temperature of degrees F using the following correction factors a. . per degree F for petroleum oils having a speciﬁc gravity degrees F above .
b. . per degree F for petroleum oils having a speciﬁc gravity degrees F between .
and .
c. . per degree F for emulsiﬁed asphalt Unless volume correction tables are available the following formula shall be used in computing the volume of asphalt at temperatures other than degrees F V V x KT Where V volume of asphalt to be corrected V volume of asphalt at degrees F K correction factor coefﬁcient of expansion and T temperature in degrees F of asphalt to be corrected .
When asphalt is delivered by weight the volume at degrees F will be determined by dividing the net weight by the weight per gallon at degrees F. When speciﬁed in the Contract asphalt will be measured by weight .
Net certiﬁed scale weights or weights based on certiﬁed volumes in the case of rail shipments will be used as a basis of measurement subject to correction when asphalt has been lost from the car or the distributor disposed of or otherwise not incorporated in the work .
When asphalt is shipped by truck or transport net certiﬁed weights or volumes subjected to correction for loss or foaming may be used to compute quantities .
Only the quantity of asphalt actually placed in the work and accepted will be considered in determining the amount due the Contractor . .
Timber Timber will be measured in units of foot board measure actually incor porated in the structure .
Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of each piece .
.Plan Quantities When speciﬁed in the Contract Contract items will be measured and paid for on the basis of plan quantities .
The quantities allowed for compensation will be those shown on the plans with deductions from or authorized additions to such quantities resulting from authorized deviations from the plans . .
In the case of excavation only excavation within the cross section prism will be paid for on a plan quantity basis .
If the Contractor believes that any plan quantity is incorrect he may solicit at his own expense the aid of a Professional Engineer liscensed to practice engineering in the Commonwealth of Virginia to check the quantity or he may ask the Department in writing to check computations of the quantity .
Written requests for a quantity check by the Department shall be accompanied by calculations drawings or other evidence indicating why the plan quantity is believed to be in error .
If any item of the Contract is found to be in error and so veriﬁed by the Engineer payment will be made in accordance with the corrected plan quantity .
If the Department determines during construction that there is an error in the plan quantity or that conditions vary from those anticipated in the design to the extent that an actual measurement of a plan quantity item is warranted the Department will make such measurement and will notify the Contractor in writing of the rationale for adjustment .
Payment will then be based on the measured quantity in lieu of the plan quantity .
.Scope of Payment Payments to the Contractor will be made for the actual quantities of Contract items performed in accor dance with the plans and the requirements of the Speciﬁcations and other Contract documents .
If upon completion of the Work the actual quantities vary either by an increase or decrease from the estimated quantities shown in the Contract the Contract unit prices shall prevail and payment will be made for ac tual quantities performed at such unit prices unless the unit prices have been modiﬁed by written change orders according to Sections and .
as determined by the Engineer .
Quantities appearing on the Proposal are estimated quantities for the basic design shown on the plans .
With the Engineers approval the Contractor may furnish other designs that may involve changes in quantities or the use of different materials .
However payment will be made for the original quantities listed in the Contract only and in the units of measure given in the Contract for the basic design unless the dimensions for the basic design are changed by an authorized change order to conform to ﬁeld conditions encountered .
In this event the original quantities listed will be modiﬁed based on the change in dimension and the mod iﬁed quantities will be used for pay quantities at Contract unit prices for the items listed on the Proposal .
The Contractor shall accept the compensation provided for in the Contract as full payment for the following a Furnishing all materials labor tools equipment and incidentals necessary to complete the Work according to the Contract .
b Performing all work speciﬁed in the Contract .

If such delay occurs it will in no way relieve the Contractor of his obligation to meet the .
Contract time limits or other Contract requirements or constitute basis for a Contractor to make a delay claim . .
If the Contractor requests a time extension based on extra work the requested time extension will only be considered if the extra work impacts the critical path a con trolling work item or an interim milestone established in the Contract to the extent that it extends the Completion Date of the project beyond the lattermost of the Contract Completion Date or its most recent extension .
The Contractor shall submit detailed documents and information showing how the extra work or interim milestone impacted the critical path in accordance with Section .. Any time extension given including time extensions in accordance with Section .
must be included in the executed change order . .
Upon receipt and review of the Contractors costs for the proposed extra work if it is found that the Contractors prices or the time differ considerably from the Departments estimate the Engineer may request the Contractor to provide support for his prices or his requested time extension .
Where the Department and the Contractor can determine and agree upon an accurate cost and time estimation for the proposed work the Engineer will issue a Bilateral Change Order to authorize the work .
When the Contractor and the Department can not agree upon the cost or the time estimation for the extra work after the Engineers analysis and subsequent discussion with the Contractor or where due to issues of emergency safety environmental damage other similar critical factors as determined by the Department the Engineer will act unilaterally and issue a Unilateral Change Order to authorize the work .
The issuance of a Unilateral Change Order by the Engineer shall in no way invalidate or relinquish the Contractors rights under Section .. b Payment by Force Account The Department will require the Contractor to proceed with extra work on a force account basis when neither the Department nor the Contractor can ﬁrmly establish a reliable estimate for the cost of the extra work because either the scope or the quantity of work is unknown is of such character that a price can not be determined to a reasonable degree of accuracy or the level of effort required to perform and complete the extra work is unknown or not quantiﬁable at the time of discovery or start of the extra work and will be determined as work progresses .

a .
The Contractor is entitled to payment of HOOH only for compensable delays for which the Engineer has granted a Contract time extension and only when the Con tractor could not reasonably recoup its HOOH while its workforce was idled by the delay because the Contractor was required to remain on standby ready to resume work and unable to perform other work at the project or elsewhere during the delay .
The Contractor is not entitled to compensation for HOOH for delays that are caused by extra work performed on a Force Account basis or by increased quantities .
b .
The agreed amount of compensation for extended or unabsorbed HOOH for a compensable delay will be determined as follows AC B D DE F Where A Original total Contract amount B Original Contract duration number of calendar days between and inclusive of the Contract Notice to Proceed NTP date and the original Contract Completion Date C Agreed allowable HOOH percentage D Daily allowable HOOH rate E Number of days of compensable delay F Agreed amount of compensation for HOOH .
When to Audit to Determine FOOH and HOOH The Contractor may propose a higher rate determined according to Federal Acquisition Regulations CFR or other accounting standard if the Contractor determines that the agreed allowable HOOH percentage is insufﬁcient . .
The Itemized Project FOOH Costs IPFC and FOOH shall be subject to ﬁeld veriﬁcation and Department audit at any time as determined by the Engineer if the Engineer deter mines that the rate the Contractor submits is not an accurate representation of the Contrac tors actual FOOH at the time of occurrence of the delay .
If the Engineer determines the daily FOOH rate is not an accurate representation of the Contractors actual FOOH the Contractor shall submit its actual project FOOH records at the time of occurrence of the delay as requested by the Engineer .
The Department may perform an audit of the Contrac tors records as necessary to verify the Contractors actual project FOOH .
Adjustments to the daily FOOH rate may be made upon veriﬁcation or Department audit of the Contrac tors actual project FOOH .
The project daily FOOH rate will then be calculated utilizing the rate determined by the audit .
The Department may also elect to perform an audit of the Contractors actual project FOOH at the completion of the Contract as determined by the Engineer in which case the project FOOH paid previously by change order may be adjusted based on the rate determined by the audit .
The Contractors actual extended FOOH are deﬁned to be those costs and expenses in curred from the original Contract time limit to the actual ﬁnal acceptance of the project as documented by timesheets payroll records accounting records contracts invoices bills receipts tickets cancelled checks and similar business records showing the costs and expenses actually incurred for the project ﬁeld supervision and administrative staff project ﬁeld ofﬁce and overhead items submitted in accordance with this provision and the records must be accurate and auditable .
If the total sum of the extended project FOOH and unabsorbed or extended HOOH for all approved change orders exceeds percent of the original Contract amount the Depart ment may at its option calculate the amount of FOOH and HOOH based on a Department audit of the Contractors actual project FOOH and HOOH records .
In such event the De partment will perform the audit according to Section .
at the Departments expense .
The Department audit may begin on days notice to the Contractor its subcontractors and suppliers .
The Contractor subcontractors and suppliers shall make a good faith effort to cooperate with the auditors. . Other Delay Costs The Contractor may incur costs attributable to compensable delays in addition to FOOH and HOOH .

If any of the stored materials are lost or become damaged the Contractor shall repair or replace them at no additional cost to the Department .
Repair or replacement of such material will not be considered the basis for any extension of Contract time .
If payment allowance has been made prior to such damage or loss the amount so allowed or a proportionate part thereof will be deducted from the next progress estimate payment and withheld until satisfactory repairs or replacement has been made .
When it is determined to be impractical to store materials within the limits of the project the Engineer may approve storage on private property or for structural units and reinforcing steel on the manufacturers or fabricators yard .
Requests for payment allowance for such stored material shall be accompanied by a release from the owner or tenant of such property or yard agreeing to permit the removal of the materials from the property without cost to the Common wealth .
The Department must be allowed access to the materials for inspection during normal business hours .

The nominal pile resistance as measured during driving using this method shall be taken as follows Rndr .Ed .
log Nb where Rndr nominal pile resistance measured during pile driving kips .

If ram velocity is not measured it may be assumed equal to the potential energy of the ram at the height of the stroke taken as the ram weight times the actual stroke ftIbs Nb number of hammer blows for .
in .
of pile permanent set blowsin .
If a dynamic formula other than those provided herein is used it shall be calibrated based on measured static load test results to obtain an appropriate resistance factor consistent with Article CI of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Speciﬁcations .
This formula is applicable only when the hammer has a free fall the head of the pile is not broomed or crushed the penetration is reasonably quick and uniform or a follower is not used .
If the Engineer determines that energy losses attributable to pile rebound exceed the nominal values assumed in this formula the nominal pile resistance shall be reevaluated by wave equa tion analysis that rationally considers energy losses in the cap pile and soil .
.Driving Criteria a Bearing Bearing resistance values for concrete and steel piles shall be determined by the loading tests speciﬁed in .a .

In the absence of loading tests wave equation analysis or a dynamic test the nominal pile resistance may be approximated by using the pile formula speciﬁed in .d .
The character of the soil penetrated conditions of driving followers size length and weight of the piles and computed load per pile shall be given due consideration in determining the nominal pile resistance .
Bearing piles shall be driven until the blow count determined to produce the required nominal pile resistance has been continuously maintained for feet or to practical refusal whichever occurs ﬁrst .
b Practical Refusal Practical refusal is deﬁned as twice the blow count required to produce nominal pile resistance .
In the case of driving to a very dense or hard stratum the driving criterion should be based on blows per inch criterion and should address limiting the blows following an abrupt refusal to prevent damage .
In no case shall driving continue for more than inches at practical refusal driving conditions .
Based on the results of the wave equation dynamic analysis andor the driving test the Engi neer may elect to adjust the criteria for practical refusal but in no case shall practical refusal be greater than blows per inch .
c A pile shall not be driven above the blow count where wave equation analysis or dynamic testing results indicates that maximum stress levels will be exceeded .

SECTION TRAINEES ON CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS .Description This work shall consist of providing the training speciﬁed herein as part of the Contractors EEO Afﬁrmative Action Program .
This speciﬁcation implements the provisions and requirements of CFR Part Subpart A Appendix B .
.Procedures The Contractor shall provide each trainee with a copy of the speciﬁc training program and a certiﬁcate showing the type and duration of training satisfactorily completed upon completion of the training pro gram .
The Contractor shall maintain records and furnish periodic reports to the Engineer documenting compliance with the requirements herein .
a Number of Trainees The number of trainees for each contract shall be as speciﬁed in the Contract .
The number of trainees is determined by the District Civil Rights Manager DCRM .
If the Contractor sublets a portion of the Contract the Contractor shall determine how many trainees are to be trained by the subcontractor .
The Contractor shall retain the primary respon sibility for conforming to the training requirements imposed by this speciﬁcation .
The Con tractor shall ensure that these same training requirements are included and made applicable to the subcontract .
Where feasible percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their ﬁrst year of apprenticeship or training .
b Distribution of Trainees The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work classiﬁ cations on the basis of the Contractors needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classiﬁcations within a reasonable area of recruitment .
The Contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by the Contractor or approved subcontractors under the Contract who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program .
The enrollment of minorities women and other disadvantaged persons is approved and moni tored by the DCRM .
Trainees will be enrolled and approved by the DCRM on Form C prior to the start of training .
c Minorities and Women Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen status are primary objectives under this program .
The Contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority and women trainees by conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women trainees to the extent such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment .
The Contractor shall demonstrate the steps taken in pursuit thereof prior to a determination as to whether or not the Contractor is in compliance with the requirements herein .
This training commitment shall not be used to discriminate against any applicant for training whether a member of a minority group or not .
d Use of Journeymen No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classiﬁcation in which the person has successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status or has been employed as a journeyman .
The Contractor shall satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions on the employee application or by other suitable means .
The Contractors records shall document the ﬁndings in each case. . e Length and Type of Training The minimum length and type of training for each classiﬁcation shall be established in the training program selected by the Contractor and approved by the DCRM .
The DCRM will approve a program if it is reasonably calculated and designed to meet the EEO obligations of the Contractor and qualify the average trainee for journeymen status in the indicated classiﬁcation by the end of the training period .
Apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or with a state apprenticeship program Virginia Department of Labor Industry recognized by the U.S. De partment of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training will also be considered acceptable in meeting the trainee contract goal provided they are being administered in a manner consistent with the EEO obligations of the Contract .
Approval of a training program shall be obtained from the DCRM prior to the commencement of work in the classiﬁcation covered by the program .
Training shall be provided in the construction trade classiﬁcations indicated in the On the Job Training OJT Manual for Standard PreApproved Job Classiﬁcations .
The Contractor shall provide all training on state or federally funded projects of the Department .
f Commencement of Training It is normally expected that a trainee will begin training on the project as soon as is feasible after the start of the work that requires the skill involved and will remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in the work classiﬁcation or until the trainee has completed the training program .
It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire duration of the contract .
The number trained will be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled under the contract for the entire contract period .
g Payment to Trainees Trainees shall be paid at least percent of the appropriate prevailing minimum journeymans rate for the ﬁrst half of the training period percent for the third quarter of the training period and percent for the last quarter of the training period unless apprentices in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on the project .
In such cases the appropriate rates approved by the DCRM in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classiﬁcation who are covered by these requirements .
h Failure to Provide Required Training The Contractors failure to provide the required training damages the effectiveness and integrity of this Afﬁrmative Action Program and circumvents the Departments federal mandate to bring women and minorities into the highway construction industry .
Therefore if the Contractor has failed by the end of the project to meet the required trainee contract goal the Contractor shall submit written good faith documentation indicating the reasons the trainee goal was not attained .
This documentation shall be submitted to the DCRM and should it be determined insufﬁcient the lack of commitment to this Afﬁrmative Action Program will be relayed to the Engineer for inclusion in the Contractors Performance Evaluation Report for the project .
Efforts taken by a Contractor that result in the OJT contract goal being exceeded will be recog nized for the Contractors support of the Departments commitment to assuring skill improve ment opportunities for minorities and women in highway construction .
To exceed an OJT goal is to enroll and graduate more trainees than the number speciﬁed in the contract .
.Measurement and Payment The Contractor will be paid .
per hour for each employee who is trained in accordance with the approved training program except as otherwise noted hereinafter .
The DCRM can request approval by the Engineer that .
a Contractor be paid for training persons in excess of the trainee contract goal speciﬁed or for trainees enrolled on a contract without a trainee goal .
If approved this payment will be made even though the Contractor re ceived additional training program funds from other sources provided such other sources do not speciﬁcally prohibit the Contractor from receiving other payments .
The Department will pay the Contractor stipend .
per training hour for training occurring on state or federally funded Department projects .
The Contractor will be credited for each apprenticetrainee employed on the project and will be reim bursed on the basis of hours worked listed on certiﬁed payrolls and the weekly submittal of trainee Form C. This form will serve as a record of trainee hours completed under the Contract .
If in the judgment of the Contractor Engineer and DCRM a trainee becomes proﬁcient enough to qualify as a journeyman before the end of the prescribed training program and the Contractor so employs the trainee full credit will be given toward the attainment of the trainee goal however the Contractor will be paid only for the actual trainee hours completed .
The Department will pay the Contractor for only those training hours completed if the trainee does not complete training due to layoff termination or resignation .
No payment will be made to the Contractor should the required training not be provided or the trainee is not hired as a journeyman and there is evidence of a lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor in complying with the requirements speciﬁed herein .
