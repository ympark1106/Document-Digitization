If an acceptable negotiated price can not be established prior to the work being performed the Department may require the contractor to perform the work on a force account basis .
.. Unit Prices When payments are made at the contracts established unit prices and the work requires a material change in construction method or sequence adjustment to the unit prices for or against the contractor shall be made in accordance with .
and ..
Negotiated Prices The Departments objective is to compensate the contractor using the same pricing formulas established by the contractor in determining the original bid contract prices .
Therefore reasonable rates for labor burden company owned equipment internal cost recovery rates jobsite overhead items and rates home office overhead and profit markup on direct costs and other pricing components established by the contractor at the time the original contract bid prices were determined will also be used in determining the negotiated prices for the change order work .
The change order authorizing the work shall include a detail cost breakdown showing direct labor materials equipment and subcontractor costs as well as each of the pricing components listed above .
In order to facilitate the identification of the original contract bid prices and the detailed cost breakdown used in bid preparation the contractor is encouraged to place their original bid estimate preparation documents working papers and notes in escrow upon executing the awarded contract and provide the Department proof of such placement in accordance with ..

Equipment In accordance with TR furnish a DOTD certified inertial profiler for quality control and acceptance testing .
The inertial profiler shall measure both wheel paths simultaneously with laser height sensing equipment at a constant speed within the certified range .
Due to the surface texture of PCCP lasers with a footprint greater than a single point are recommended for accurate readings .
Profilers require a current DOTD decal indicating the date of certification and the profilers system parameter settings .
Furnish a foot metal static straightedge for quality control and acceptance testing for transverse cross slope grade and individual longitudinal bumps in excess of inch in feet .
Additionally bumps are not to exceed inch in feet for nonIRI pavements including but not limited to bike paths detour roads parking areas sidewalks turning lanes turn outs and shoulders .
Quality Control Longitudinal Smoothness Run the certified profiler and evaluate the raw IRI data using the ProVAL foot sliding baseline to identify areas of localized roughness as defined by Table for each wheelpath .
Correct deficiencies in accordance with Table and modify construction operations to mitigate deficiencies .
Any individual bump which is more than inch when tested with a foot metal static straightedge is a deficiency which requires correction .
Have quality control IRI results available for assessment by the engineer as requested .
Correction of Deficient Areas Correct areas to meet the requirements of Table and the inch in feet straight edge bump requirement .
Correct transverse cross slope or grade deficiencies to meet specifications .
Make corrections by removing and replacing the PCCP full depth or by diamond grinding and reestablishing surface texture and depth .
Make corrections at no direct pay .
In cases involving minor dips and extreme vertical curves where grinding will not improve the surface profile provide the engineer a justification plus a ProVAL screen shot for the area showing the foot sliding baseline and corresponding foot profilograph along with a request to accept as constructed .

Submit to the engineer for approval the locations and screen shots for any allowed uncorrected deficiencies in accordance with Although grinding for some areas may be deemed unnecessary by the engineer the measured roughness for such areas will still contribute to the total IRI for the project .
In addition the Department will check for inch bumps at locations determined by the engineer .
Correct deficiencies in accordance with A DOTD inspector will be present for the acceptance testing and will immediately receive a copy of the raw data the .erd file and any files with information about the project the operator the equipment the settings daily pre operation results and a copy of the IRI results via USB flash drive .
In addition to the data transferred by USB storage device provide the engineer a paper copy of the IRI report .
Acceptance for the project will be in accordance with Tables and .
The Department may elect to perform and utilize independent ride quality test results for acceptance at any time .
Exclusions Take the IRI acceptance measurement in its entirety without exclusions .
The Department will then review the profile report obtained for each lane .
In special cases or extenuating circumstances the engineer may isolate or exclude sections of the profile .
These include the following Bridges including the approach slabs Curb and gutter sections just the affected wheel path and adjacent areas Manholes catch basins valve and junction boxes Intersections of a different grade Structures located in the roadway which cause abrupt deviations in the profile Ramps less than feet Sections where the project engineer determines that attaining smoothness is beyond the contractors reasonable control .
The roughness in excluded areas will not be included in the total IRI used for payment purposes but shall meet the requirements of and Table .
The quantity represented by the roadway length excluded will not receive any bonus pay adjustment for surface tolerance .
