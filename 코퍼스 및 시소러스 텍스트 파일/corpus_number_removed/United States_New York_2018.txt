Evidence of such negotiation includes the names addresses and telephone numbers of DMWBEs that were considered a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for DMWBEs to perform the work .
b .
Additional Costs .

VALUE ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSAL VECP .
A .
Purpose and Scope .
The purpose of a Value Engineering Change Proposal VECP is to encourage the use of the Contractors ingenuity and experience in arriving at alternative construction designs methods and procedures that result in a lower direct cost to accomplish a contract requirement .
It is the intent of this provision to share with the Contractor any substantial direct cost savings which may be generated as a result of a VECP offered by the Contractor and approved by the Department .
A VECP is a Contractorinitiated change request .
If approved the changes and payments will be authorized through the change order process .
Before a VECP can be implemented it must pass through three approval processes conceptual approval formal approval and change order approval .
To expedite the review process the Contractor has the option of jointly submitting the conceptual VECP and the formal VECP for simultaneous review .
If the VECP receives formal NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May approval as part of the change order process the Contractor may request that the Department consider granting advanced authorization of extra work .
The VECP should produce direct cost savings to the Department and the public without in the sole judgment of the Department impairing essential functions and characteristics of the facility including but not limited to service life economy of operation ease of maintenance desired appearance and safety .
The Contractor when developing a VECP shall address the designers objectives environmental permit requirements and regulations commitments made to the public to mitigate the impact of construction and other such concerns .
The direct cost savings is the difference of the construction savings generated by implementing the VECP minus reasonable design costs associated with the VECP .
The construction savings is the difference between what it would cost to complete all the contract work without implementing the VECP and the cost to complete all the contract work if the VECP is implemented .
This includes any changes to quantities or unit prices across the entire contract if affected by the VECP .
If the estimated cost to complete all the contract work without implementing the VECP differs from the contract bid amount for the work supporting documentation to explain the variance shall be provided .
Reimbursable design costs are specific to engineering changes examples design changes plan sheet revisions and quantity estimating .
Expenditures toward proposal preparation examples scheduling documentation cost analysis material research etc .
are not reimbursable .
Indirect cost savings time user delay railroad force account costs inspection costs etc .
although considered when reviewing the merits of the VECP are not reimbursed .
A VECP may alter the progress schedule and milestone dates which in turn could affect timerelated contract provisions .
Proposals that reduce the time to complete the contract and only result in indirect cost savings may be accepted based on the mutual benefit derived .
These proposals will be evaluated in accordance with F. Time Savings .
B. Submittal of Conceptual VECP .
A conceptual proposal is required for all VECP .
It should outline the general technical concepts associated with the VECP and the estimated direct cost savings which may result .
Upon review by the Department one of the following actions will be taken Conceptual approval and a request for the Contractor to submit a formal VECP .
Request for additional information Rejection of the VECP The Contractor shall submit an original and three copies of the conceptual VECP to the Engineer along with any additional information requested by the Department .
The conceptual VECP should contain sufficient information for concept review and evaluation including the following as a minimum .

the latest date by which authorization of the VECP extra work must be granted without affecting the schedule .
The draft progress schedule should provide a sufficient level of detail upon which the reasonableness of the VECP can be determined .
Should the Department find that insufficient time is available for review and processing it may reject the VECP solely on such basis .
If the Department fails to respond to the VECP by the date specified the Contractor will consider the VECP rejected and will have no basis for a dispute against the State as a result thereof .
The Department may accept a VECP that requires a contract time extension if sufficient cost savings are anticipated. . Estimate of costs .
The conceptual VECP estimate of costs should include sufficient information to determine the reasonableness of the VECP .

NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May The Department will not formally approve any VECP until all required VECP documentation has been submitted and is acceptable to the Department .
A formal VECP may be submitted concurrently with the conceptual VECP however the Contractor assumes any costs associated with the formal VECP at its own risk .
Reimbursable costs will be considered only if the conceptual VECP is approved .
Clearly identify whether a VECP is being submitted for conceptual approval formal approval or both .
Once a formal VECP has been approved the VECP will then be submitted as an orderon contract and processed accordingly .
If time sensitive requests for advanced authorization of extra work per Changes Contingencies Extra Work and Deductions will be considered but only after formal VECP approval .
The Contractor is responsible for submitting all appropriate information to the Engineer in a timely manner .
D. Conditions .
The Contractor shall not base any bid prices on the anticipated approval of a VECP and should recognize that any VECP may be rejected .
The following terms and conditions apply to VECP .
A VECP will only be considered after the contract is awarded. . A VECP applies only to the contract for which it was submitted .
One VECP shall not be submitted for multiple contracts .
Approval or disapproval of a VECP on one contract does not guarantee approval or disapproval on another contract . .
The VECP becomes the property of the Department and will contain no restrictions imposed by the Contractor on its use or disclosure .
The Department will have the right to use duplicate and disclose in whole or in part any data necessary for the utilization of the VECP .
The Department retains the right to utilize any accepted or rejected VECP or part thereof on any other project without any obligation to the Contractor. . Approval of the conceptual VECP in no way obligates the Department to approve the formal VECP .
The Contractor will have no claim against the Department as a result of the rejection of any such conceptual or formal VECP except as otherwise provided in E .. .
When the Department is in the process of making design and specification revisions and a Contractor submits a VECP with similar revisions the Department will reject the VECP and proceed without any obligation to the Contractor. . A VECP will be considered only if reasonable costeffective options are not provided in the contract documents . .
The Department will be the sole judge as to whether a VECP qualifies for consideration and evaluation .
It may reject any VECP that requires excessive time or costs for design review evaluation andor investigations .
The Department will be the sole judge in determining if the proposed VECP will result in a sufficient amount of direct or indirect cost savings to offset the Departments effort to review the VECP. . A VECP shall be consistent with the Departments design policies and basic design criteria provide the same service life or more facilitate economy of operations ease of maintenance and achieve the desired appearance and safety. . A VECP will not be allowed that changes the type andor thickness of the pavement structure and material or solely substitutes one material for another .
Examples of materials that may fall into this inappropriate substitution situation are drainage pipes bridge coatings pavement NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May markings etc .
The simple elimination of work does not necessarily constitute a VECP however a VECP which introduces a simple material substitution or elimination of work may be considered if it is accompanied by a design change or change in the construction method .
A simple material substitution which introduces a new material to the Department may be also considered . .
The VECP will not be experimental in nature but will have been proven to the Departments satisfaction under similar or acceptable conditions on another Department contract or at another location acceptable to the Department . .
If the Department requires any additional information to evaluate the VECP this information shall be provided in a timely manner .
Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon failure to do so will result in the rejection of the VECP .
An incomplete or a poor quality VECP which hinders the Departments review may also result in the rejection of the VECP . .
The Contractor shall encourage submissions of VECP from an approved subcontractor provided that reimbursement is made by the Department to the Contractor and that the terms of payment to the Subcontractor are satisfactorily negotiated and accepted before the VECP is submitted to the Department .
Subcontractors may not submit a VECP except through the Contractor. . A VECP approved by the Department is considered to be a revision to the contract documents and progress schedule .
Consequently if unsatisfactory results are being achieved or adjustments are necessary during implementation of a VECP the rejection of work removal of work addition of work or revision of work shall be evaluated in accordance with the Standard Specifications. . All contract pay items and quantities referenced in the VECP construction savings analysis shall be Departmentapproved contract provisions .
Any extra work inclusion of an omission of work or other field changes shall be authorized prior to use in VECP savings calculations. . No work related to a VECP will be performed under force account .
Agreed prices must be reached for any contract pay items related to the VECP before the VECP is approved .
If the Contractor is deemed to have taken reasonable diligence in determining the work involved but if during the construction of VECP work a significant change in the character of work occurs the Department may consider new agreed prices . .
The Contractor will receive written notification from the Department when the VECP is approved .
Material orders placed prior to VECP approval shall be submitted at the Contractors risk. . Once a VECP has been approved the VECP will then be submitted as a change order and processed accordingly .

The Contractor is responsible for submitting all appropriate information to the Engineer in a timely manner .
E. Payment .
If the VECP is accepted by the Department the changes and payments will be authorized through a change order .
Reimbursement to the Contractor will be made as follows NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May .
A VECP introduces two individual payments one for VECP construction savings and one for VECP design cost .
The contract pay item changes along with the VECP construction savings and design cost reimbursements to the Contractor should be submitted in one change order . .
The Department will pay to the Contractor of the VECP construction savings .
The VECP construction savings is the difference between the actual contract costs with the VECP implemented and a detailed estimate of what it would have cost to complete the contract work without implementing the VECP based on final construction .
If final construction savings differs from the amount estimated in the formal VECP an adjustment may be made and included in another change order .
The VECP construction savings reimbursement to the Contractor will not be paid until the VECP work has been completed progress payments on the completed VECP work are allowed .
The Department may withhold all or a portion of the payment for the Contractors share of the VECP construction savings until the final contract accounting .
In the event that at final contract accountings the implementation of VECP actually results in no construction savings then the Contractor will receive no VECP construction savings payment .
The Department is the sole judge in deciding the construction savings due to the implementation of the VECP .
The Department will withhold VECP construction savings reimbursement until the Contractor supplies all required VECP documents . .
If a design cost is submitted for a VECP the Department will pay to the Contractor a share of the Contractors reasonable cost for design incurred after conceptual VECP approval .
If the design cost submitted for Department approval is deemed unreasonable only of the design cost deemed to be reasonable will be reimbursed .
Not every VECP will have a design cost associated with it .
The Department is the sole judge in determining the reasonableness of the design cost .
Reimbursable design costs are for engineering changes .
Preparation and submission of the proposal e.g .
savings analysis progress scheduling etc .
are not considered design costs and are not reimbursable .
Reimbursable VECP design may be performed by a consultant or directly by the Contractor .
The Contractor shall not be charged for nor can the Contractor claim any VECP design performed by the Department .
The design cost shall be submitted as a lump sum item with supporting documentation .
The supporting documentation shall include itemized direct salary costs rates hours overhead only for consultant design and direct nonsalary costs .
Payment for direct salary costs and overhead will be limited to the current Department reimbursement policies for Consultant Engineering agreements .
For consultant design reasonable overhead on the direct technical salaries will be reimbursed .
For Contractor design overhead is not reimbursable for direct salary costs .
Overhead shall not be charged for direct nonsalary costs whether incurred by the Contractor or by a consultant .
Payment for direct nonsalary costs will be made at actual cost paid .
Although for certain direct nonsalary costs lodging meals mileage there are prevailing maximum rates established by the State Comptroller which the reimbursement rates shall not exceed .
The subtotal of direct salary costs overhead and direct nonsalary costs shall be considered a professional service fee and reimbursed in accordance with B .. Service Charges .
A maximum for the Contractors contract supervision and overhead is allowed in addition to any overhead submitted for consultant direct salary costs .
All design costs are subject to audit .
Additional supporting documentation receipts time sheets etc .
shall be supplied in a timely manner if requested by the Department .
In the case of a formal VECP being jointly submitted with the conceptual VECP the Department will pay to the Contractor a share of the Contractors reasonable cost for design specific to the development of the formal VECP nothing toward the conceptual VECP if the conceptual VECP is approved .
NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May .
In the event of the Departments conceptual approval of a direct cost savings VECP and the Contractor is directed to proceed with the VECP implementation steps and final approval is not reached regardless of whether due to the actions of the Department or the Contractor of the total reasonable design costs will still be reimbursed to the Contractor .
If advance written approval was given to proceed with the work procure materials and begin fabrication and rejection occurs the work and fabrication costs will be reimbursed in accordance with Extra Work and Time Related Compensation .
Only those materials not incorporated and unique to the contract i.e .
not restockable will be evaluated for payment . .
There will be no reimbursement for any costs incurred for the conceptual VECP or prior preparations . .
If more than one VECP is approved for a contract construction savings and design costs shall be tracked separately for each VECP . .
When multiple submittals of information for a VECP are required to satisfy the information needs of the conceptual or formal VECP procedure and contract timing will be negatively impacted before review and subsequent approval can be given by the Department then the VECP may be rejected .
In such cases there will be no claim by the Contractor for design costs or loss of anticipated savings andor profits. . VECP payments only involve direct savings or costs .
Indirect savings or costs time user delay contract delay etc .
are not included in VECP payment calculations .
The calculations of VECP payments are independent from the payments or penalties for contract time related issues .
If a VECP revises the progress schedule the contract milestones upon which time related provisions are based may be affected .
Time savings resulting from a VECP may be realized in a time related contract provision .
Conversely if a VECP negatively affects a progress schedule time related contract provisions may be negatively affected .
F. Time Savings .
The Department will consider proposals that result in time savings and at the same time may increase the cost of the contract .
The Department will be the sole judge as to whether the benefits of completing the contract or a phase before the scheduled completion date or milestone offsets any increase in cost .
These submittals while not constituting a Value Engineering Change Proposal will be reviewed using the VECP approval process .
In addition to information required in B. Submittal of Conceptual VECP and C. Submittal of Formal VECP the Contractor shall provide the Department the anticipated amount of time to be saved and sufficient information to enable the Department to calculate and evaluate the cost benefit of the savings in user delay .
Time savings generated by the VECP may be claimed under an existing time related contract provision .
If the time savings VECP increases the cost of the contract the additional cost shall not be subtracted from any time related contract provision payments .
G. Significant Changes .
The description of what will be considered a significant change associated with a VECP are identified in Significant Changes in the Character of Work .
Once a VECP is approved any future significant change is no longer based on the original contract bid conditions quantity nature or kind of a material involved but rather on the conditions as adjusted by the VECP adjusted quantities anticipated site conditions and materials etc .. Any item that was identified as a Major Item in the original contract documents is still considered a Major Item regardless of the change in quantity or price due to the VECP .
All significant changes shall be agreed upon prior to formal VECP approval .
If after formal VECP approval an unforeseen change in the VECP work causes a significant change in the character of work quantities and prices may be adjusted and the VECP savings shall be adjusted accordingly .

SURVEY AND STAKEOUT .
Prior to the start of construction work all right of way markers property line markers and survey control markers located in or adjacent to areas which may be disturbed during construction shall be properly protected and tied to fixed reference points or located from established contract control .
Upon completion of the work all right of way or property line markers or survey markers that have been disturbed by the Contractor shall be reset under the direction of a Land Surveyor .
Field location notes shall be recorded and made available to the Engineer upon request at no additional cost to the State .
All survey control and boundary location work shall be performed in accordance with the Departments Land Surveying Standards and Procedures Manual under the direction of a Land Surveyor .
All survey work performed for quality control by the Contractor and for quality assurance by the Department should both utilize similar levels of measurement precision and methods to perform NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May positional measurements the same control network from which measurements are made and the same survey measurement procedures to ensure consistency of results .
Terrain features are measured and positioned by various methods relative to the contract control network established for each contract .
The precision with which an instrument or equipment positions a point is related to the quality of the method by which measurements are made and the ability to duplicate the same measurement .
The local accuracy of a located point is the closeness of the measured or computed value to a standard or accepted value actual spatial position on the earth .
Positional tolerance is the allowable spatial difference between making measurements by two different methods or by the same method at separate times all of which have the same level of precision .
Horizontal coordinates and vertical elevations of existing features provided as part of the contract are located in the field based on accuracies achievable for each positional point relative to the contract control .
Positional accuracies are directly related to the strength of the contract control network the methods used to make the measurements the precision of the instruments used to measure to the feature and how definable the feature is which is being located .
Point feature locations represent a single position for example property line marker sign post utility pole or fire hydrant and can be reidentified or verified in the field to within a small variation high confidence level from where they were initially positioned .
Linear feature locations define the alignment of that feature .
That alignment can be verified to within a specific tolerance depending on the spacing or frequency at which the points were originally measured to define that alignment .
Straight or uniformly curved linear features for example curbline edge of roadway or edge of sidewalk which can be easily defined in the field should have a relatively small positional variation from their designed location when compared to a verified field location .
Irregular shaped or not as clearly defined linear features for example break lines ditchlines treelines or environmental area perimeters which are sometimes difficult to define or delineate precisely in the field could have a larger variation from where they were initially positioned when compared to a fieldverified location .
Digital terrain model DTM surfaces when provided by the Department are made up of a combination of point and linear features .
The precision of a data collection instrument does not necessarily indicate what positional tolerance should be expected of any feature verified from an existing DTM .
The location or elevation of a feature selected from a DTM surface can at best be determined by interpolating the horizontal position or elevation between previously located points .
The verification of any specific elevation on the DTM surface is directly related to the spacing of collected data or breaklines used to produce that surface the uniformity of the surface being measured the steepness of the slope of that surface and how obscured the surface is from the measuring technique used to originally locate the surface .
Standardized procedures for determining the spacingfrequency of point and linear features including break lines are critical to providing consistent results .
Department standardized procedures for determining feature locations are described in both the Land Surveying Standards and Procedures Manual and the Specifications for Photogrammetric Stereocompilation .
Verification of the positional tolerance of the DTM surface elevation requires a comparison of the original collected point data with recollected point data measured at the same horizontal locations .
Field comparisons to interpolated DTM surfaces or recreated surface information from other information sources shall not be used for verification of the positional tolerance of a feature .
Comparisons of re measured point data can only be made with the original collected point data not to interpolated positions .
Measurements for verification of DTM point data shall also be made from the same contract control network and by instruments capable of an equal or greater precision .
INSPECTION .
Department Inspectors are authorized to inspect all work done and materials furnished including all or any part of the work and the preparation fabrication or manufacture of the materials to be used .

NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May J .
Borrow .
Borrow is material required for earthwork construction in excess of the quantity of suitable material available from the required grading cuts and excavations .
Borrow may be necessary even though not shown in the contract documents .
K. Embankment Construction Control Devices .
Embankment construction control devices allow realtime observations of embankment construction to assess the actual performance of the embankment compared to that envisioned in the design phase .
Settlement and pore water pressure are common measures of embankment performance .
Techniques for monitoring settlement include a settlement rod or a surface settlement gauge .
A settlement rod is an optical survey technique to monitor settlement of the embankment surface .
The settlement rods establish monitoring points in relation to a reliable bench mark .
A surface settlement gauge is an optical survey technique to monitor settlement of the existing ground surface below the embankment installation .
The surface settlement gauge is installed prior to placing the embankment and extended upwards through the fill .
Pore water pressure monitoring may be used to determine the effective overburden diagrams the basis of all geotechnical analyses monitoring consolidation progress of embankments constructed over soft soils evaluating seepage in natural slopes or earth dams slope stability checking the effectiveness of subsurface drainage facilities or monitoring water well tests .
A piezometer is an instrument which provides measurements of pore water pressure at the elevation of the installed sensor .
Pore pressure data is needed in a foundation soil to assess the excess pore water pressure and hence the undrained strength of the soil .
Piezometers are used at various depths within cohesive foundation soils .
Some piezometers are used in granular foundation soils to assess their drainage behavior .
L. Proof Rolling .
Proof rolling consists of applying test loads over the subgrade surface by means of a heavy pneumatictired roller of specified design to locate and permit timely correction of deficiencies likely to adversely affect performance of the pavement structure .
M. Select Granular Fill Slope Protection .
Select granular fill slope protection is a material used to protect the grade of a slope from erosion and sloughing from runoff and groundwater seepage .
Seepage is the slow movement of water through small openings and spaces in the surface of unsaturated soil into or out of a body of surface or subsurface water .
Sloughing is a shallow surface failure caused by erosive removal of supporting material .
Select granular fill slope protection is highly permeable while also providing sufficient frictional resistance to resist seepage forces and remain in place .
N. Applying Water .
Under this work the Contractor shall furnish and apply water for dust control .
Moisture control for compaction purposes is the Contractors responsibility .
Water shall not be applied in inclement weather or when the temperature is F or less .
O. Modifying Cut Slopes and Other Means of Obtaining Borrow .
The Regional Director may approve the modification of cut slopes and other means of obtaining material which is not part of the contract so long as provisions are made to prevent unsafe conditions damage and nuisances to property wildlife areas and haul routes within and outside the contract limits .
Such approval may be granted only after review of a written proposal by the Contractor showing the final deposition of the material the haul route hauling hours and provisions necessary to comply with the above .
Should unanticipated conditions arise resulting in any unsatisfactory situation the Engineer shall immediately rescind the approval pending satisfactory correction .
The following procedure shall apply to areas within the R.O.W .
limits which are not designated as available sources of borrow by a Special Note in the contract proposal where the Contractor requests and is granted permission to modify slopes to obtain material for use on State contract work NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS USC May only .
The Contractor will be required to reimburse the State with a rebate for the material obtained in these areas .
Permission will not be granted to excavate material beyond the design slopes if it is to be used on other than State contract work .
The rebate to be obtained from the Contractor for this material is comprised of A royalty based on the actual value of the excavated material and A credit for the difference in the Contractors handling costs if these handling costs have been reduced .
The royalty which is to be obtained for the excavated material shall be appropriate for the item for which it is to be utilized and shall be comparable to the current price being paid to purchase similar material in the area .
If the Contractors handling costs associated with obtaining material from within the R.O.W .
limits are greater than those for obtaining material from other acceptable sources these additional handling costs must be borne by the Contractor .
The royalty shall not be reduced to offset any increased handling costs incurred by the Contractor .
If the Contractors handling costs associated with obtaining materials from within the R.O.W .
limits are less than those for obtaining material from other acceptable sources the differences shall be reimbursed to the State as a credit in addition to the royalty .
The difference in the Contractors handling cost shall be determined by an analysis based on a comparison of haul lengths hauling equipment hauling operation use of haul roads or public highways preparation and restoration of the borrow areas and any other variables involved .
Prior to modifying rock cut slopes the Geotechnical Engineering Bureau must be consulted .
If rock cut slopes are flattened sufficiently to eliminate the need for presplitting an additional rebate will be necessary .
All special requirements to be fulfilled by the Contractor at the Contractors own expense shall be clearly stated in the agreement .
The foregoing requirement of receiving a rebate from the Contractor for material obtained by modification of slopes shall apply only to locations not designated in the Contract Documents .
P. Winter Earthwork .
Compaction of soil during cold weather is difficult and can be impractical .
Water acts as a lubricant aiding in the process of compaction .
As the temperature decreases the water becomes more viscous less slippery and inhibits efforts to pack the soil particles together .
Eventually the water becomes ice at which point compaction is impossible .
For this reason New York State does not permit normal earthwork placement between November st thru April st unless there is an approved Winter Earthwork submittal .
Winter Earthwork is defined as construction operations requiring soil compaction performed from November st thru April st .
The execution of Winter Earthwork requires modifications to compaction procedures changes to material requirements andor additional equipment and structure assembly for controlling the weather effects on the material and existing ground conditions .
Although Winter Earthwork may be performed when the air temperature ground temperature or material temperature is at or below F frozen material will not be placed nor will fill material be placed on ground frozen to any depth in any work incorporated into the final product MATERIALS .

Pictorial standards are available from the Materials Bureau . .
Replacement of Pavement Markings .
The Contractor shall not remove existing pavement markings and leave the highway unmarked overnight .
METHOD OF MEASUREMENT .
Surface cleaning and preparation of pavement surfaces for lines will be measured in feet along the centerline of the prepared surface and will be based on a nominal inches wide line .
Measurement for cleaning surfaces for line widths greater than the nominal inches will be made by the following method Nominal Existing Width of Line inches x Length feet inches No payment will be made for the additional inch of cleaning on each side of the line required by .. No payment will be made for cleaning the number of feet of unmarked gaps between broken or dotted line segments .
Cleaning and preparation of letters and symbols on pavement surfaces will be measured by each unit cleaned .

Under this work the Contractor shall furnish and install a casing by trenchless installation methods in accordance with the contract documents and as directed by the Engineer .
The casing length type and size shall be as indicated in the contract documents .
Acceptable methods of trenchless installation include Auger Boring Slurry Boring Pipe Jacking Microtunneling or Horizontal Directional Drilling .
Pipe Ramming or Soil Compaction methods will not be allowed .
For an installation under a railroad methods which leave an uncased bore hole through the embankment will not be allowed. . Definitions .
The following definitions were obtained from the NCHRP Synthesis Trenchless Installation of Conduits Beneath Roadways .
A. Auger Boring AB .
A technique that forms a bore hole from a drive shaft to a reception shaft by means of a rotating cutting head .
Spoil is transported back to the drive shaft by helicalwound auger flights rotating inside a steel casing that is being jacked in place simultaneously .
AB may provide limited tracking and steering capability .
It does not provide continuous support to the excavation face .
AB is typically a stage process i.e .
casing installation and product pipe installation .
B. Slurry Boring SB .
A technique that forms a bore hole from a drive shaft to a reception shaft by means of a drill bit and drill tubing stem .
A drilling fluid i.e .
bentonite slurry water or air pressure is used to facilitate the drilling process by keeping the drill bit clean and aiding with spoil removal .
It is a stage process .
Typically an unsupported horizontal hole is produced in the first stage .
The pipe is installed in the second stage .
C. Pipe Jacking PJ .
A technique for installing a prefabricated pipe through the ground from a drive shaft to a reception shaft .
The pipe is propelled by jacks located in the drive shaft .
The jacking force is transmitted through the pipe to the face of the PJ excavation .
The excavation is accomplished and the spoil is transported out of the jacking pipe and shaft manually or mechanically .
Both the excavation and spoil removal processes require workers to be inside the pipe during the jacking operation .
D. Microtunneling MT .
A remotely controlled guided pipejacking process that provides continuous support to the excavation face .
The guidance system usually consists of a laser mounted in the drive shaft communicating a reference line to a target mounted inside the MT machines articulated steering head .
The MT process provides ability to control excavation face stability by applying mechanical or fluid pressure to counterbalance the earth and hydrostatic pressures .
E. Horizontal Directional Drilling HDD .
A stage process that consists of drilling a small diameter pilot directional hole along a predetermined path and then developing the pilot hole into a suitable bore hole that will accommodate the desired utility and then pulling the utility into place .
The HDD process provides the ability to track the location of the drill bit and steer it during the drilling process .
The vertical profile of the bore hole is typically in the shape of an arc entrapping drilling fluid to form a slurry pathway rather than an open hole .
This entrapped slurry provides continuous support to the bore hole .
F. Utility Tunneling UT .
A stage process in which a temporary ground support system is constructed to permit the installation of a utility .
The temporary tunnel liner is installed as the tunnel is constructed .
Workers are required inside the tunnel to perform the excavation andor spoil removal .
The excavation can be accomplished manually or mechanically .
