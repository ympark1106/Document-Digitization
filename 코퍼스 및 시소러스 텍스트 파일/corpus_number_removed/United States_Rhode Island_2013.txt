Differencing will be accomplished by taking cross sections at intervals stated herein by standard field survey techniques .
Two sets of cross sections will be taken over the area to be excavated one set of the area in its original position and a final set after completion of excavation .
Intermediate sets of cross sections may be authorized for progress payment purposes .
Should the final set of cross sections indicate unauthorized excavation below the design subgrade the excess excavation shall not be measured for payment .
However the excess excavation shall be replaced by available suitable excavation or borrow material all provided placed and compacted at no cost to the State .
The final set of cross sections may include an amount for overbreakage or slides as subsequently defined which in the judgment of the Engineer were not caused by any carelessness on the part of the Contractor .
The cross sections will then be plotted and the volume determined by either the average endarea method or such other equivalent method acceptable to the Engineer .
a .
Earth Excavation .
Earth excavation shall be measured by the cubic yard as calculated by differencing the area excavated from its original position before earth excavation is begun to its position when .
There has occurred a change in classification of excavation or .
The design subgrade elevation has been reached or .
The approved limits of excavation of unsuitable soils below design subgrade elevation or behind design side slopes are reached or .
The approved limits of excavation of unsuitable soils under shallow embankment have been reached .
Area differencing shall be conducted by taking cross sections as described above in this Subsection b .
Presplit Bedrock .
Presplitting of bedrock shall be measured by the number of square yards of area of presplit rock face along the alignment at the inclination designated on the Plans .
This area shall be measured and calculated as follows At onehalf station locations the distance from the top of the presplit face to the toe of the presplit face including toe drain shall be measured using a steel tape held taut and against the top and toe of slope .
Onehalf station areas shall be calculated by multiplying the average of adjacent onehalf station measurements by a onehalf station horizontal distance .

Should the cross sections indicate bottom overbreakage and excavation in excess of the inch allowance the Contractor shall not be paid for rock excavation in excess of the overbreakage allowance .

.. Embankments .
When the Contract specifically provides for payment for embank ments or when embankments are constructed with material obtained from sources other than excavation embankment will be measured by the number of cubic yards of material actually placed and compacted within the limits of the design embankment section .
The inplace volume will be calculated by differencing cross sections taken along the original ground from those taken along the top of the completed embankment .
The two sets of cross sections will then be plotted and the volume determined by either the average endarea method or such other equivalent method approved by the Engineer .
All boulders and detached stones which have a volume in excess of cubic yard and which the Contractor desires to incorporate into embankment construction must first be broken up into fragments whose respective volumes are cubic yard or less .
There will be no additional payment for breaking up such boulders and stones .
When the Contract does not specifically provide for payment for embankment or when embankments are constructed with material obtained solely from excavation the work of embankment construction will not be measured or paid for separately but will be considered incidental to the various classifications of excavation .
However when embankment is constructed from excavation material and there is required borrow material to complete the embankment this borrow material shall be measured for payment .

Care shall be taken not to work the crown out of the pavement during the operation .
After floating any excess water and laitance shall be removed from the surface of the pavement by a straightedge feet or more in length .

If the average measurement of these three cores is not deficient more than inch from the Plan thickness full payment will be made .
If the average thickness of the three cores is deficient more than inch but not more than inch from the Plan thickness an adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection .. will be paid for the area represented by these cores .
In calculating the average thickness of the base measurements which are in excess of the specified thickness by more than inch will be considered as the specified thickness plus inch and measurements which are less than the specified thickness by more than inch will not be included in the average .
When the measurement of any core is less than the Plan thickness by more than inch the actual thickness of the base in this area will be determined by taking additional cores at foot intervals parallel to the centerline in each direction from the affected location until in each direction a core is found which is not deficient by more than inch .
Areas found deficient in thickness by more than inch shall be evaluated by the Engineer .
If the Engineer decides that the deficient areas should be removed they shall be removed and replaced with concrete of the thickness shown on the Plans .
Exploratory cores for deficient thickness will not be used in averages for adjusted unit price .
