WORDING OF THE SPECIFICATIONS The North Dakota Department of Transportation has written the Standard Speci ﬁ cations for Road and Bridge Construction Standard Speciﬁ cations with an em phasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice someone acts on something .
For example The Engineer will take a sample .
A similar sentence in the passive voiceA sample will be takenwould be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample .
The Standard Speciﬁ cations also make use of the imperative mood .
The impera tive mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
In the Standard Speciﬁ cations the Department is stating its requirements or directions for work to the Contractor such statements have the same force as if they contained the word shall .
In an imperative sentence such as Place the concrete the Department is indicating that it requires the Contrac tor to place the concrete .
Before award of the contract imperative statements are directed to the Bidder .
Between award and execution of the contract imperatives are directed to the lowest responsible Bidder and after execution to the Contractor .
The Department will identify parties other than the Bidder or Contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in the Standard Speciﬁ cations .
In phrasings where the respon sible party has already been clearly identiﬁ ed or in factual statements when it is not important to do so the Department may use the passive voice .
When these speciﬁ cations indicate that work shall be required requested directed authorized ordered permitted suspended approved accepted or rejected it shall be understood that these expressions and others similar to them are followed by the phrase by the Engineer. . ORGANIZATION OF THE SPECIFICATIONS A .
General .
With the exception of Section General Provisions and Section Materials the sections of the Standard Speciﬁ cations are written in a sixpart format .
Each section contains the following primary subsections XXX .
Description XXX .
Equipment XXX .
Materials XXX .
Construction Requirements XXX .
Method of Measurement XXX .
Basis of Payment The subsections contain varying numbers of titled subordinate subsections composed of higher and lower levels as in an outline .
B .
Hierarchy of Organization .
The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections .
In addi tion many subsections begin with a lowerlevel subsection called General .
The requirements of General subsections apply to the associated samelevel .
B subsections that follow they do not apply to the higher level .
All of the provisions of Section General Provisions of the Standard Speciﬁ cations apply to all portions of the contract .
C. Titles or Headings .
The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for the convenience of referencing and have no bearing on the meaning or interpretation of the text .
D. References .
The speciﬁ cations rely on many cross references both to internal sources in the speciﬁ cations and external sources in other contract documents Department manuals and other industry resources .
If the contract documents reference an external publication the Department intends that the reference be to the most recent issue including interim publications before the date of the advertisement unless the contract speciﬁ es otherwise .
When a test procedure uses the preﬁ x ND the proper test procedure can be found in the Departments Field Sampling and Testing Manual which is avail able on the Departments website www.dot.nd.gov .
Each contract item listed in the contract references to a section number from the speciﬁ cations therefore all of the provisions of that referenced section that are relevant to the proper completion of the contract item are binding upon the Contractor .
This includes the requirements found in the General subsections as well as those speciﬁ c requirements listed thereafter .
Within the speciﬁ cations references to other sections and subsections of the speciﬁ cations apply the same as if they were a part of the speciﬁ cation section or subsection from which they were referenced .
A crossreference to a speciﬁ c subsection of these speciﬁ cations includes all general requirements of the sec tion of which the subsection is a part. .

Review the weekly statement and within business days after the last day of the week covered by the statement no tify the Engineer that the weekly statement is correct or protest the weekly statement .
To protest submit to the Engineer a written request to revise the working day charges .
Failure to submit a request within business days constitutes the Contractors agreement with the working day charges in the weekly statement .
Once agreed to by the Contractor whether explicitly or because of the Contractors failure to submit a timely protest the working day charges documented by the weekly statement are ﬁ nal and the Contrac .
B. tor waives entitlement to a time extension or compensation for delays not explicitly identiﬁ ed by the weekly statement. . Calendar Day Contracts .
Calendar day contracts specify the contract time as the number of calendar days .
The completion date is determined by adding the number of calendar days speciﬁ ed in the contract to the starting date speciﬁ ed in the contract or from the date the Contractor starts work at the project site whichever is earlier .
If the notice to proceed is delayed for reasons beyond the Contractors control and not the Contractors fault or responsibility the Engineer will extend the starting date for calendar day contracts to no earlier than the seventh calen dar day after the notice to proceed or the date the Contractor starts work at the project site whichever is earlier . .
Completion Date Contracts .

After notifying the Engineer of the delay keep daily records of the labor ma terial and equipment affected by the delay as speciﬁ ed in Section .. E Force Account .
Maintain a daily record of each operation affected by the delay and the station locations of the operations affected .
The Department will also maintain daily records of the operations and station locations .
Each Monday compare the previous weeks daily records with the records kept by the Department .
Provide written notice to the Engineer within business days of the results of the comparison of the detailed records performed each Monday and list and describe any disagreements between the records .
The Contractors failure to meet with the Engineer and review the Depart ments records or to list and describe disagreements between the Contrac tors and Departments records shall establish that the Departments records .
B. are accurate that the Contractor accepts the records as prepared and that the Contractor agrees that the Departments records will be the basis for deter mining the delay and any compensation that may be due because of the delay .
In addition to the daily records prepare and submit written reports to the Engineer containing the following information each Monday a .
Number of days behind schedule .
b .
A summary of all operations that have been delayed or will be delayed .
c. In the case of a compensable delay explain how the Departments act or omission delayed each operation .
d. Itemize and document all added costs being incurred due to the delay .

Comply with the requirements of Section .. B Extensions to Contract Time when seeking a time extension for phased or interim start or ﬁ nish dates or durations .
In the event that the Department extends the contract time into a period of the year during which the working conditions are less favorable the Depart ment will consider a further extension of time based on the nature of the work the Contractor scheduled to perform during the less favorable period .
Conversely if the Department extends the contract time into a period of the year during which the working conditions are more favorable the Depart ment will consider reducing the contract time extension .
If the Department reduces the work required to complete the project or relaxes phase or stage requirements the Department may reduce the contract time . .
Evaluation of Delays and Calculation of Time Extensions .
The Engineer will evaluate the Contractors request for a time extension based on the Contractors compliance with the following requirements a .
Base all evaluations of delay and all calculations of the appropriate time extensions due on the schedules submitted to and accepted by the Depart .
B .. d.f ment and current at the time the delay occurred not schedules created after the delay occurred .
b .
The delay is on the critical path when the delay occurred .
c. The delay results in a scheduled milestone phase or stage or project completion date that is later than the date required by the contract .
d. If the contract requires a CPM schedule determine the duration of delays as follows Use time impact analysis TIA to identify and measure critical de lays that have not yet occurred .
Do not use this method to evaluate delays that have already occurred .
In general terms perform a TIA as follows a Develop a mini schedule for the changed work .
This schedule is known as a fragnet .
b Identify the current accepted schedule .
and record the scheduled completion date on that schedule .
c Insert the fragnet into the current schedule by properly linking the fragnet with the existing activities in the current accepted schedule .
d Recalculate the current schedule with the fragnet inserted and record this scheduled completion date .
e The difference in the calculated scheduled completion dates be tween the current schedule and the schedule calculated with a properly inserted and properly composed fragnet is the delay at tributable to the changed work .
The time extension due if any will be based on this delay .
Use a contemporaneous analysis when evaluating delays that have al ready occurred .
In general terms perform a contemporaneous analy sis as follows a Identify the most recent accepted schedule with a data date be fore the start of the delay being evaluated .
b Identify each accepted schedule in effect during the delay and the schedule with a data date that immediately follows the conclu sion of the delay .
c Identify the critical path each day from immediately before the start of the delay to the schedule immediately following the delay .
d Determine whether the delay falls on the critical path .
e If the delay does not fall on the critical path then no project delay occurred and no time extension is due .
f If the delay falls on the critical path then determine the number of days the critical path is delayed .
The time extension due if any will be based on this delay. . B. . Administration of Time Extensions .
The Department will administer excusable delays on working day calendar day and completion date contracts as follows a .
For working day contracts the Department will not charge working days for excusable delays except for delays caused by added work or extra work .
For delays caused by added or extra work the Department will provide a time extension by adding working days to the contract time .
