The pressure of the natural ground water existing at the time of installation and prior to placement of any embankment will be used as a reference to determine pore pressures induced by subsequent embankment placement .
The engineer may subsequently require borings outside the loaded area to facilitate observations to determine if the natural groundwater table has lowered due to seasonal or climatic variations .
Such observations may be used to lower but not raise the initial reference groundwater pressure .
The engineer will make all records of groundwater and pore water pressures readily available to the contractor for guidance in the planning of the contractors work .
If foundation pore pressure in excess of pressure from the natural water table equals or exceeds percent of the unit pressure of the embankment in place over the installation at any time placement of embankment shall be immediately suspended .
Construction shall not resume until such excess pressure declines to percent of embankment pressure unless otherwise authorized by the engineer .
After the embankment reaches an elevation equal to percent of the maximum height the contractor shall control the rate of construction in such a manner that foundation pore pressure in excess of pressure from the natural water table will not exceed percent of the unit pressure of the embankment in place over the installation at any time .
An example of pressure relationships follows Soil embankment with an average wet density of pounds per cubic foot is equal to twice the unit weight of water .
A foot of such embankment thus has a potential to create at most feet of water rise in a standpipe or a . psi increase in a Type A installation .
The contractor shall anticipate the maximum possible effect of any load to be added .
Type B installations may exhibit some time lag in rate of response to a pressure increment .
Records of pore pressure response during placement of the first percent of embankment height shall be examined for evidence of such lag .
The time required for dissipation of head during testing will also be indicative of the rate of response .
When embankment has advanced to within approximately one foot of the top of the casing the casing and the inch PVC pipe for the Type B installations shall be advanced in foot increments .
No extension shall be made without the engineers approval .
PVC pipe extensions shall be made using solvent welded couplings exercising care to make smooth squared cuts with all burrs removed in accordance with recommendations of the pipe and solvent cement manufacturers .

Excess tubing shall be stored in a steel container attached to the last casing extension as shown on the plans .
.. Settlement Records .
The engineer will make and record all measurements and elevations necessary including elevations of the plywood plate and all casing extensions for use in establishing a settlement record at the site of the pore pressure measurement device .
The inch outer steel casing will be used for this purpose .
Care shall be taken to ensure the tightest possible coupling connections using pipe wrenches without rotating the bottom pipe .
Settlement records obtained in this manner may be used to Return to Table of Contents satisfy such settlement rate requirements as may be outlined in the contract .
..
Basis of Payment .
The contract unit price shall include all effects impacts and cumulative impacts of possible restraints inherent in the use of these devices upon the rate of construction .

DBE participation on the contract will count toward meeting the DBE contract goal as follows a The applicable percentage of the total dollar value of the contract or subcontract awarded to the DBE will be counted toward meeting the DBE contract goal only if that firm is certified by the Missouri Regional Certification Committee as a DBE before the due date for bids or offers on a contract which a firm seeks to participate as a DBE and only for the value of the work goods or services that are actually performed or provided by the DBE firm itself in the areas in which the DBE firm is certified .
b When a DBE performs work as a participant in a joint venture the contractor may count toward the DBE goal only that portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct clearly defined portion of the contract work that the DBE has performed with the DBEs own forces .
The MoDOT External Civil Rights Division shall be contacted in advance regarding any joint venture involving both a DBE firm and a nonDBE firm to review and approve the contractors organizational structure and proposed operation .
When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of the contract to another firm the value of that subcontracted work may be counted toward the DBE contract goal only if the DBEs subcontractor at a lower tier is a MoDOT certified DBE .
Work that a DBE subcontracts to a nonDBE firm will not count toward the DBE contract goal .
The cost of supplies and equipment a DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the prime contractor or the primes affiliated firms or from another nonDBE subcontractor will not count toward the DBE contract goal .
c The contractor may count expenditures to a DBE subrecipient toward the DBE contract goal only if the DBE performs a commercially useful function CUF on that contract .
d A contractor may not count the participation of a DBE subcontractor toward the contractors final compliance with the contractors DBE contract goal obligations until the amount being counted has actually been paid to the DBE .
A contractor may count percent of the contractors expenditures actually paid for material and supplies obtained from a DBE certified by MoDOT as a regular dealer and percent of such expenditures actually paid for materials and supplies obtained from a certified DBE manufacturer .
A regular dealer will be defined as a firm that owns operates or maintains a store warehouse or other establishment in which the material supplies articles or equipment required and used under the contract are bought kept in stock and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of business .
To be a regular dealer the DBE firm shall be an established regular business that engages as its principal business and under its own name in the purchase and sale or lease of the products in question .
Packagers brokers manufacturers representatives or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions will not be considered regular dealers .
A DBE firm may be a regular dealer in such bulk items as petroleum products steel cement gravel stone or asphalt without owning operating or maintaining a place of business where it keeps such items in stock if the DBE both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products it sells and provides for the contract work .
Any supplementation of a regular dealers own distribution equipment shall be by a longterm lease agreement and not on an ad hoc or contractbycontract basis .
If a DBE regular dealer is used for DBE contract goal credit no additional credit will be given for hauling or delivery to the project site goods or materials sold by that DBE regular dealer .
Those delivery costs shall be deemed included in the price charged for the goods or materials by the regular dealer who shall be responsible for their distribution .
A manufacturer will be defined as a firm that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces on the premises the material supplies articles or equipment required under the contract and of the general character described by the project specifications .
A manufacturer will include firms that produce finished goods or products from raw or unfinished material or that purchases and substantially alters goods and materials to make them suitable for construction use before reselling them .
e A contractor may count toward the DBE contract goal the following expenditures to certified DBE firms that are not regular dealers or manufacturers for DBE program purposes The contractor may count toward the DBE contract goal the entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a certified DBE firm for providing a bona fide service such as professional technical consultant or managerial services or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of the federalaid contract if the fee is reasonable and not excessive compared with fees customarily charged for similar services .
Return to Table of Contents The contractor may count toward the DBE contract goal the entire amount of that portion of the construction contract that is performed by the DBEs own forces and equipment under the DBEs supervision .
This includes the cost of supplies and material ordered and paid for by the DBE for contract work including supplies purchased or equipment leased by the DBE except supplies and equipment a DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliates .
f A contractor may count toward the DBE contract goal percent of the fees paid to a certified DBE trucker or hauler for delivery of material and supplies required on a job site but not for the cost of those materials or supplies themselves or for the removal or relocation of excess material from or at the job site when the DBE certified trucking company is not also the manufacturer of or a regular dealer in those material and supplies provided that the trucking or hauling fee is determined by MoDOT to be reasonable as compared with fees customarily charged by nonDBE firms for similar services .
The certified DBE trucking firm shall also perform a CUF on the project and not operate merely as a pass through for the purposes of gaining credit toward the contract DBE goal .
Prior to submitting a bid the contractor shall determine or contact the MoDOT External Civil Rights Division for assistance in determining whether a DBE trucking firm will meet the criteria for performing a CUF on the project .
g The contractor will receive DBE contract goal credit for the fees or commissions charged by and paid to a DBE broker who arranges or expedites sales leases or other project work or service arrangements provided that those fees are determined by MoDOT to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged by nonDBE firms for similar services .

To receive DBE contract goal credit MoDOT must determine that the DBE broker has performed a CUF in providing the contract work or service . .
Performing a Commercially Useful Function CUF .
No credit toward the DBE contract goal will be allowed for contract payments or expenditures to a DBE firm if that DBE firm does not perform a CUF on that contract .
A DBE performs a CUF when the DBE is solely responsible for execution of a distinct element of the contract work and the DBE actually performs manages and supervises the work involved with the firms own forces .
To perform a CUF the DBE alone shall be responsible and alone must bear the risk for the material and supplies used on the contract selecting a supplier or dealer from those available negotiating price determining quality and quantity ordering the material and supplies installing those materials with the DBEs own forces and equipment and paying for those materials and supplies .

DBEs Must Perform a Useful and Necessary Role in Contract Completion .
A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if the DBEs role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction contract or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation. . DBEs Must Perform The Contract Work With Their Own Workforces .
If a DBE does not perform and exercise responsibility for at least percent of the total cost of the DBEs contract with the DBEs own work force or the DBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice for the type of work involved MoDOT will presume that the DBE is not performing a commercially useful function. . Factors Used to Determine if a DBE Trucking Firm is Performing a CUF .
The following factors will be used to determine whether a DBE trucking company is performing a commercially useful function CUF a To perform a CUF the DBE trucking firm shall be completely responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation that the DBE is being paid for on the contract work .
There shall not be contrived arrangement including but not limited to any arrangement that would not customarily exist under regular construction project subcontracting practices for the purpose of meeting the DBE contract goal .
b The DBE must own and operate at least one fully licensed insured and operational truck used in performance of the contract work .
This does not include a supervisors pickup truck or a similar vehicle that is not suitable for hauling the necessary materials or supplies .

The DBE firm that leases trucks from another DBE will receive credit for the total fair market value actually paid for of the transportation services the lessee DBE firm provides on the contract .
e The DBE may also lease trucks from a nonDBE firm including an owneroperator .
However the DBE who leases trucks from a nonDBE is entitled to DBE contract goal credit only for the brokerage fee or commission the DBE receives as a result of the lease arrangement .
The DBE will not receive credit for the total value of the transportation services provided by the nonDBE lessee .
Furthermore no DBE contract goal credit will be allowed even for brokerage fees or commissions where the DBE leases the trucks from the contractor on the project or a firm owned controlled by or affiliated by ownership or control to the contractor .
f For purposes of this section the lease shall indicate that the DBE firm leasing the truck has exclusive use of and control over the truck .
This will not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease with the consent of the DBE provided the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for and control over the use of the leased truck .
Leased trucks shall display the name and identification number of the DBE firm that has leased the truck at all times during the life of that lease. . MoDOT Makes Final Determination On Whether a CUF Is Performed .
MoDOT and the Commission will have the final authority to determine whether a DBE firm has performed a CUF on a federalaid contract .
To determine whether a DBE is performing or has performed a CUF MoDOT will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted by that DBE firm or performed by other firms and the other firms forces and equipment .

The contractor shall acknowledge by the act of filing the detailed list that the information is supplied to obtain payment regarding a federal participation contract. . Failure on the part of the contractor to achieve the DBE participation to which the contractor committed in the contract may result in liquidated damages being imposed on the contractor by the Commission for breach of contract and for noncompliance .
If the contract was awarded with less than the original DBE contract goal proposed by the Commission the revised lower amount shall become the final DBE contract goal and that goal will be used to determine any liquidated damages to be assessed .
Additionally the Commission or MoDOT may impose any other administrative sanctions or remedies available at law or provided by the contract in the event of breach by the contractor by failing to satisfy the contractors DBE contract goal commitment .
However no liquidated damages will be assessed and no other administrative sanctions or remedies will be imposed when for reasons beyond the control of the contractor and despite the good faith efforts made by the contractor the final DBE contract goal participation percentage was not achieved .

TRAINING PROVISION .
Description .
This provision supplements subparagraph e of the Contract Provision entitled Standard Federal Equal Opportunity Construction Contract Specification Executive Order and in the implementation of CFR Part Subpart A Appendix B. . Training Requirements .
As part of the contractors equal employment opportunity affirmative action program training shall be provided as follows . .
The contractor shall provide onthejob training aimed at developing full journeymen in the type of trade or job classification involved . .
The number of trainee hours to be provided under this provision will be specified in the bidding documents. . Trainee goals will be set in hour increments or slot person .
For example if the trainee goal on the project is hours a maximum of trainees will be approved for the project .
In the event a trainee leaves the project for valid reasons the trainee shall be replaced as soon as possible .
No apprenticetrainee can be assigned less than hours on a contract .
Providing less than hours is not considered to be beneficial training nor helping to achieve journeylevel status .
Therefore a traineeapprentice regardless of craft must have been trained on the contact for at least hours to be eligible for reimbursement .
However the contractor may transfer the trainee with MoDOTs approval to another MoDOT highway construction project in order to continue the training .
Upon reaching the hours the contractor will be compensated as noted herein .
If the enrollee is transferred to a nonfederal project MoDOT upon availability of funding may have the option of reimbursing the contractor for those hours completed that achieve the hour minimum and for any hours that continue the successful training of the individuals .
The same documentation will be required to be submitted in order to determine if hours will be approved .
However if the trainee is moved to another federally funded enhancement then a change order could be requested for the additional hours and thus offer the Contractor the necessary credit so as to accomplish the hour plateau .
FHWA and MoDOT will only approve training programs meeting the requirements of the Training Special Provisions TSP .
A program will be approved if it is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the Contractor and to qualify the average trainee for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period .
Furthermore apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or with a State apprenticeship agency recognized by the Bureau and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the Department of Labor Manpower Administration Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training will also be considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federalaid highway construction contracts . .
When a contractor subcontracts a portion of the contract work the contractor shall determine how many if any of the trainee hours are to be trained by the subcontractor provided however that the contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements imposed by this provision ..
The contractor shall also insure this training provision is made applicable to such subcontract .
Where feasible percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training . .
The number of trainee hours shall be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of the contractors needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classifications within a reasonable area of recruitment .
Prior to commencing construction the contractor shall submit to the engineer for approval a trainee notification for each individual they intend to train on the project .
The contractor will be credited for the hours worked by each trainee employed on the contract work who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program and will be reimbursed for such trainees as provided hereinafter .
If the trainee goal on the project is no more than two trainees will be approved for the project .
Each individual must complete at least hours before reimbursement or hour will be counted towards meeting the goal .
In the event a trainee leaves the training program prior to completing the minimum hours the External Civil Rights Division will determine if that individual can be replaced on the project. . Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeyman status is a primary objective of this provision .
Accordingly the contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority trainees and women e.g .
by conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women trainees to the extent that such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment .
The contractor shall be responsible for demonstrating the steps taken in pursuance thereof prior to a determination as to whether the contractor is in compliance with this provision .
This training commitment is not intended and shall not be used to discriminate against any applicant for training whether a member of a Return to Table of Contents minority group or not. .

The contractor shall satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions in the employee application or by other suitable means .
Regardless of the method used the contractors records shall document the findings in each case . .
The minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established in the training program selected by the contractor and approved by the engineer and FHWA .
A program will be approved if it is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor and to qualify the average trainee for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period Furthermore apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or with a state apprenticeship agency recognized by the Bureau of apprenticeship and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the Department of Labor Manpower Administration Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training will also be considered acceptable provided the training is being administered consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federalaid highway construction contracts. . Approval or acceptance of a training program shall be obtained from the engineer prior to beginning work on the classification covered by the program .
It is the intention of these provisions that training is to be provided in the construction crafts rather than clerktypists or secretarialtype positions .
Training will be permissible in lower level management positions such as office engineers estimators timekeepers etc .
where the training is oriented toward construction applications and must be approved by FHWA .
Training in the laborer classification may be permitted provided significant and meaningful training is provided and approved by the engineer .
Some offsite training will be permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a significant part of the overall training . .
Except as otherwise noted below the contractor will be reimbursed .
per hour of training given an employee in the contract in accordance with an approved training program .
As approved by the engineer reimbursement will be made for training persons in excess of the number of trainee hours specified in the contract .
Reimbursement will be made even though the contractor receives additional training program funds from other sources provided such other sources do not specifically prohibit the contractor from receiving other reimbursement .
Reimbursement for offsite training indicated above may only be made to the contractor when the trainees are concurrently employed on a federalaid project and the contractor does one or more of the following and contributes to the cost of the training provides instruction to the trainee or pays the trainees wages during the offsite training period .
In order receive the reimbursement the trainee must complete at least hours on the project .
No payment will be made to the contractor if either failure to provide the required training or failure to hire the trainee as a journeyman is caused by the contractor and evidences a lack of good faith on the part of the contractor in meeting the requirements of this provision .
It is normally expected that a trainee will begin training on the project as soon as feasible after start of work utilizing the skill involved and remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in the trainees work classification or until the trainee has completed the training program .
It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire length of the contract .
The contractors responsibilities under this provision will be fulfilled if the contractor has provided acceptable training for the number of trainee hours specified . .
Trainees shall be paid at least percent of the appropriate minimum journeymans rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period percent for the third quarter of the training period and percent for the last quarter of the training period unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on this project .
In that case the appropriate rates approved by the U.S. Department of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program will apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification who are covered by this provision . .
Contractor may choose to transfer trainee hours worked on another project whether MoDOT or not .
The contractor must submit monthly trainee reports for that project to the RE Office where the hours will be credited .
The contractor must submit with the monthly trainee reports copies of the certified payrolls so the RE Office can verify the number of hours worked on the project as well as the wage the trainee was being paid .
Once the RE reviews the monthly reports copies of the monthly reports should be sent to the External Civil Rights Division .
The RE Office should include with the report a note indicating the hours that are being transferred from the other project .
Both job numbers must be included in the note . .
When the job is complete the contractor must have at least of the trainee hours assigned on that job completed .
The percentage of job completion is based on the total value of the contract paid to the Contractor .
The remaining amount of the hours must be completed before the completion of the project or the Contractor will be subject to liquidated damages unless a GFE is submitted to and approved by the External Civil Rights Division . .
If the training hours have not been obtained and a GFE has not been displayed upon project completion the Contractor will be assessed liquidated damages in the amount of .
per hour for those hours not realized .
For instance if the project goal was hours and only hours were met then liquidated damages would be assessed at x .

The Administrative Reconsideration Committee may be constituted as MoDOT deems appropriate and fair provided no committee member on the Reconsideration Committee shall have taken part in the original MoDOT determination that the contractor failed to meet the OJT contract goal andor failed to make adequate good faith efforts to do so . .
If the Administrative Reconsideration Committee does not find the contactor met the OJT contract goal andor does not find the contractor made adequate and sufficient good faith efforts to do so then the Administrative Reconsideration Committee will recommend that liquidated damages as outlined in the noncompliance sanctions sections of the OJT Training Special Provision will be carried out .
If the Administrative Reconsideration Committed does find that the contractor has met a good faith effort GFE then no liquidated damages will be assessed . .
If the Contractor does not achieve the full OJT goal they will not receive partial credit for hours completed .
For instance if the goal on the project was hours and only were convened then no reimbursement will be given for any hours fulfilled .
If the goal on the project is hours and only hours are completed and no GFE is demonstrated the contractor will receive credit for the hours and also be assessed liquidated damages in the amount of the hours there were not met . .
