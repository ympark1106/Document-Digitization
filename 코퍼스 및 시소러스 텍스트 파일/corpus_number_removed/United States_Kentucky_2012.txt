The Engineer will make transactions only with the Contractor .
The Engineer will recognize subcontractors only in the similar capacity of employees or workers of the Contractor who are subject to the same requirements as to character and competence as specified in Subsection .. . PROGRESS SCHEDULE .
Specification .
applies to all Cabinet projects except the following project types Right of Way Mowing andor Litter Removal Waterborne Paint Striping Projects that contain Special Provision Projects that contain the Special Note for CPM Scheduling The scheduling documents are considered the Contractors plan of action .
The Contractor may change their plan of action as needed .
However the Contractor must inform the Cabinet of deviations from the schedule giving the Cabinet a hour notice prior to working on items deviating from the schedule .
The hour notice can be reduced if approved by the Engineer .
The Contractor should attempt to follow their schedule if possible and any deviations must be reflected in the next schedule update .
Working without the submittal of a Written Narrative is violation of this specification and additionally voids the Contractors right to delay claims .
If the Engineer deems a Preconstruction Conference necessary submit a written narrative as described below at least two working days prior to the Preconstruction Conference .
During the Preconstruction Conference the Contractor shall make a verbal presentation of their progress schedule detailing their proposed progression of work including the items discussed in the written narrative .
If the Engineer does not deem a Preconstruction Conference necessary the Contractor will submit a Written Narrative to the Engineer at least two working days prior to the start of work .
Any submission of scheduling documents must be in triplicate and be accompanied by a signed statement of approval by the Contractors project superintendentmanager .
The written narrative submitted prior to work or the Preconstruction Conference is assumed to be the Contractors asbid plan and may need to be revised as these conditions allow .
These initial project schedule documents should reflect the Contractors schedule as the project was bid .
Any questions that the Contractor may have that would lead to changes in this schedule should be discussed at the Preconstruction Conference and the initial schedule can be adjusted based on those discussions .
The Department will review the schedule in general for the purpose of managing its employees and resources and for conformance to the specifications and flow of logic .
The Department accepts no liability for determining the Contractors ability to meet their schedule as it is Contractors sole responsibility to provide an accurate and feasible schedule .

When the Written Narrative is not received for review two working days prior to the preconstruction conference or if they are not in conformance with the specifications the preconstruction conference will be postponed until two working days after submission of an acceptable Written Narrative .
When at the Preconstruction Conference or anytime during the project the Engineer determines that the project warrants the submittal of an Activity Bar Chart the Contractor will have days to submit the baseline progress schedule documents consisting of a Written Narrative and Activity Bar Chart .
These documents should describe the schedule in Level detail for the upcoming days and at least Level detail for the remainder of the project the Levels of Detail are described in part D of this section .
These baseline documents should be updated monthly or as agreed upon by the Contractor and Engineer to reflect project progress .
The submittal of bar chart or Critical Path Method schedule does not relieve the Contractors requirement to submit a Written Narrative schedule .
When there is no Preconstruction Conference or when the Engineer determines that a Written Narrative alone will suffice for the progress scheduling documents updates will occur through biweekly progress schedule meetings between the Contractor and Engineer .
The format and frequency of these meetings may be adjusted only when mutually agreed upon by the Engineer and Contractor .
When baseline scheduling or update scheduling documents are not submitted within their time limitations or when any of the provisions within this section of the project specifications are not satisfied the progress pay estimates will be held until the scheduling documents are presented or the outstanding provisions are satisfied .
When the provisions of this section have not been satisfied such that two consecutive progress payments have been held the Department will continue to withhold progress payments and will charge the Contractor a daily penalty equal to one half the projects liquidated damages rate starting from the date the scheduling documents were due and continuing until the provisions of this section are met .
Any costs associated with these scheduling requirements and updates are incidental to the project .

.. Mixing .
A Cement .
Dry Mixing .
Immediately after distributing mix the cement with the soil for the full depth of treatment .
Take care to avoid mixing cement below the specified depth .
Continue mixing until the cement has been sufficiently blended with the soil to prevent forming cement balls when applying water .
Moist Mixing .
Immediately after the soil and cement have been dry mixed uniformly apply and incorporate water into the mixture .
Apply the water uniformly using pressuredistributing equipment .
The Department will allow application of water during dry mixing when introduced through the mixing machine .
Immediately after mixing the Engineer will determine the moisture content of the soil cement mixture .
When directed by the Engineer uniformly apply additional water .
Avoid concentration near the surface when incorporating water into the soil and cement mixture .
After adding the last increment of water continue mixing until percent of the soil passes a one inch sieve and at least percent of the soil passes a No .
sieve exclusive of gravel or stone retained on these sieves .
After completing the water application and mixing ensure that the moisture content of the mixture is not below the specified optimum moisture or more than percent above the specified optimum moisture and is less than the quantity that causes the roadbed to become unstable during compaction and finishing .
Do not allow any mixture of soil and cement that has not been compacted and finished to remain undisturbed for more than minutes .
When the soilcement mixture is wetted by rain to the extent that the moisture content exceeds the tolerance specified herein reconstruct the entire section .
B Lime .
During the period after the application of lime until completion of preliminary curing add water to maintain the moisture content of the material at or above its specified optimum at all times .
Because water is needed to sustain chemical reactions occurring after applying the lime a continual application of water during mixing may be necessary even when the material is at optimum moisture when mixing begins .
Primary Mixing .
Immediately after spreading the specified quantity thoroughly mix the lime into the soil for the full depth of treatment .
Complete the primary mixing operation within hours after applying lime .
At this time the result shall be a homogeneous friable mixture of soil and lime free from clods or lumps exceeding inches in size .
After primary mixing shape the lime treated layer to the approximate cross section and lightly compact to minimize evaporation loss .
Crown the surface to provide surface drainage .
Preliminary Curing mellowing .
Following primary mixing allow hours for the roadbed to cure mellow .
The Department will allow remixing after hours if the gradation requirement is obtained .
The characteristics of the soil temperature and rainfall may influence the mellowing period necessary .
During the mellowing period keep the surface of the material moist to prevent drying and cracking .
Final Mixing and Pulverizing .
Within hours after the preliminary curing completely mix and pulverize the roadbed to the full depth of stabilization .
Continue final mixing until percent of the soil exclusive of rock particles pass the one inch sieve and at least percent pass a No .
sieve .
.. Compaction and Surface Finish .
Compact the mixture uniformly for its full depth to at least percent of the maximum density determined according to KM .
The Engineer will determine the density .
Compact continuously until completing the final compacted surface .

Only remove material to level in small isolated spots .
Discard any material removed from the cured roadbed .
.. Curing and Protection .
After finishing the roadbed protect it against drying by applying an asphalt curing seal .
Apply the curing seal as soon as possible but no later than hours after completion of finishing operations .
Keep the finished roadbed moist by continuous sprinkling if necessary until applying the curing seal .
Only apply the asphalt material to a roadbed surface that is dense free from loose extraneous material and that contains sufficient moisture to prevent penetration of the asphalt material .
Provide a curing seal consisting of the asphalt material specified and uniformly apply the curing seal at the rate of approximately .
pounds per square yard .
The Engineer will determine the actual rate and application temperature of asphalt material .
Apply the curing seal in sufficient quantity to provide a continuous membrane over the roadbed .
To avoid excessive runoff apply the seal in or more applications when directed or allowed making each application as soon as possible after the previous application .
Do not allow any traffic or equipment on the finished surface until days above F curing is completed or the roadbed cores achieve a minimum strength requirement of psi .
The Department will only require cores when the Contractor requests a shortened curing time .
When a shortened curing time is requested furnish cores to the treated depth of the roadbed at feet intervals for each lane .
The Department will test the cores using an unconfined compression test .
If any damage occurs before curing is complete immediately reseal the damaged area .
If the asphalt material is tacky or sticky apply a sand blotter material at a rate of approximately pounds per square yard when the Engineer directs to avoid damage to the seal or to avoid tracking material onto other facilities .
After the curing period protect any finished portion of the roadbed that equipment travels on from being marred or damaged .
Repair any damage caused by freezing .
Make every reasonable effort to completely cover the stabilized roadbed with the specified pavement courses before suspending work for the winter months .
If the stabilized roadbed is not completely covered by the specified pavement courses determine and perform any further work necessary to protect and maintain the uncompleted work during the winter months .
Perform any work necessary to acceptably repair or restore the uncompleted work before the beginning of spring paving operations .

Accurately measure and control the entire quantity of mixing water to within .
percent accuracy .
Mix each batch no less than revolutions at the plant site at the rate of rotation the manufacturer specifies for a mixing speed .
The Department will allow a reduction in mixing to revolutions when the batch is charged so that all ingredients including water are uniformly blended during charging to produce a satisfactory mixture .
In this case mix the concrete an additional revolutions at the specified mixing speed at the job site .
When the Engineer allows additional water or admixtures at the job site mix the concrete an additional revolutions at the specified mixing speed after addition .
Perform any additional mixing at a lower speed as the mixer manufacturer specifies for agitation and continuously agitate until discharging the batch .
Replace or repair any truck mixer that does not produce a uniform mixture .
Central Plant Mixing .
When using a centralmixing plant mix the concrete in an approved drum type mixer or pan type mixer .
For drum type mixers having a rated capacity of cubic yards or less mix for a minimum of seconds .
For mixers having capacities greater than cubic yards mix for a minimum of seconds .
The Department will allow a reduction in the minimum mixing time for drum type mixers from to seconds when the concrete ingredients are uniformly blended during the charging of the mixer .
In order to attain uniform blending charge the batch so that the flows of water coarse aggregate fine aggregate and cement are started continued and ended simultaneously or nearly simultaneously .
For pan type mixers having a rated capacity of cubic yards or less mix for a minimum of seconds .
Increase the mixing time for pan type mixers having rated capacities greater than cubic yards by seconds for each cubic yards over that allowed for the cubic yard mixer .
Any fraction of cubic yards is considered to be cubic yards .
The Engineer may increase the minimum mixing time for any type of mixer if the mixer does not produce the desirable quality with respect to uniformity of mixture slump and air content or upon proof by tests that concrete of an undesirable quality with regard to compressive strength would be prevented by additional mixing .

Placing Concrete .
A General .
Deliver concrete to its final position of placement within the time required for delivery after mixing and within the required time interval between delivery of batches as specified for the method of mixing and handling employed .
Moisten forms and reinforcement with water immediately before placing the concrete .
Ensure that all equipment used for handling or placing concrete accommodates concrete of the proportions and consistencies as specified .
The Engineer will make no adjustments in mixture proportions to accommodate equipment incapable of handling concrete of specified proportions and consistencies .
Whenever possible completely remove water from all foundation excavations before depositing concrete .
When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water place concrete according to the requirements specified .
Employ methods and manners of placing concrete that avoid segregation or separation of aggregates or displacement of reinforcement .
The Department will allow the use of long chutes troughs belts and pipes for conveying concrete from the mixing plant or point of delivery to the forms only with the Engineers written permission .
When the Engineer allows such conveyers and the quality of concrete or methods of placing or working it are not satisfactory discontinue their use and reequip his plant or conveyance to place concrete in a satisfactory manner .
Arrange and use troughs pipes or chutes used as aids in placing concrete so that ingredients of the concrete are not separated .
Where steep slopes are required equip the chutes with baffle boards or provide the chutes in short lengths that change the direction of movement .
Maintain all chutes troughs and pipes clean and free from coating of hardened concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after each run or when out of operation for more than minutes .
Discharge water used for flushing clear of inplace concrete .
Use troughs pipes and chutes that are either metal or metal lined and extend as near as possible to the point of deposit .
Do not use aluminum or aluminum alloy troughs pipes or chutes that have surface damage or for lengths greater than feet .
Do not drop concrete in excess of feet without using pipe or tremies and do not deposit a large quantity at any point and run or work it along the forms .
When pumping equip the delivery pipe with a nozzle having a minimum of right angles at the discharge end .
Alternate nozzles or restriction devices may be allowed with prior approval by the Engineer .
Maintain the discharge end of the pipe as close to the point of deposit as feasible .
Place concrete to entirely fill but not bulge or distort the forms or to disturb their alignment .
Fill each part of the forms by depositing concrete as near its final position as possible to work the coarser aggregate back from the face and to force concrete under and around reinforcing bars without displacing them .
After concrete has taken its initial set avoid jarring the forms or placing any strain on ends of projecting reinforcement .
Consolidate concrete in all bridges and box culverts with a mechanical vibrator operated within the mass of concrete .
Consolidate concrete in all other concrete construction exclusive of pavement either by vibration as described herein or with approved spading tools .
When vibrating concrete the Engineer will require spading in addition to vibrating to prevent formation of honeycomb voids and air pockets against the forms except for concrete placed in pavements bridge slabs footings and culvert slabs .
Provide vibration of sufficient intensity and duration to cause flow or settlement of the concrete and complete consolidation but ensure that vibration is not used to cause concrete to flow over long distances in the forms or is unduly prolonged to cause segregation or undesirable laitance at the surface of the lift being consolidated .
Use plastic coated vibrators when necessary to prevent damage to the epoxy coating of the steel .
Provide and use a sufficient number of mechanical vibrators to ensure that consolidation can be started immediately after concrete has been deposited in the forms .
Do not attach the mechanical vibrator to the forms or reinforcing steel or apply to the surface of the concrete .
Apply the vibrator to the concrete immediately after depositing the concrete and move it throughout the mass thoroughly working the concrete around the reinforcement embedded fixtures and into angles and corners of the forms .
Design forms to provide for requirements of vibration .
Place concrete in continuous horizontal layers not exceeding a thickness of one foot unless otherwise specified for different types of structures .
In any given layer place and consolidate consecutive batches before the preceding batch has taken its initial set .
Ensure that each layer of concrete retains a rough surface to secure efficient bonding with the next layer .
Consolidate a succeeding layer placed before the underlying layer has set in a manner that will entirely break up and eliminate the tendency to produce a cold joint between layers .
Construct the bridge seats comprising the area of that portion of the pier or abutment tops receiving steel bridge bearings to an elevation of inch greater than that specified in the Plans for an area in excess of the bearing area occupied by masonry bearing plates .
Construct this excess material for the bearing area with mortar of the same proportions as that in the concrete and cast it monolithic with the pier or abutment .
Prevent the coarse aggregate from being placed within inch of finished elevation specified in the Plans .
Immediately after depositing the mortar strike the surface off by means of a wooden float .
When the concrete has thoroughly hardened finish it to the true correct elevation specified in the Plans by tooling and polishing .
Test the finished surface with a spirit level and ensure that there is no variation in excess of inch above or below a true level plane .
When temporarily discontinuing placing clean the concrete after it becomes firm enough to retain its form of laitance and other objectionable material to a sufficient depth to expose sound concrete .
To avoid visible joints as far as possible upon exposed faces make construction joints according to Subsection Regulate the method and manner of placing concrete so as to place all construction joints across regions of low shearing stress and in locations that will be hidden from view the greatest possible extent .
Use methods and sequences of placing concrete for various types of concrete bridge construction as specified for the particular type of construction involved .
Deposit and consolidate concrete to form a compact dense and impervious mass of uniform texture having smooth faces on exposed surfaces .
When any section of concrete is defective remove and satisfactorily replace or repair it as directed .
B Placing Concrete Under Water .
Do not expose concrete to the action of water before setting or deposit it in water except upon the Engineers written permission .
Mix all concrete deposited under water in proportions specified for Class A Modified .
Place concrete deposited under water in its final position by means of a tremie or by other approved methods .
Do not disturb it after depositing .
Provide a sufficient number of tremies or other approved devices to ensure proper distribution of concrete to all portions of the seal .
Maintain calm water at the point of deposit .
Do not place any concrete in flowing water .
Ensure that all form work such as interlocking sheeting designed to retain concrete under water is watertight .
Regulate the consistency of the concrete to prevent segregation of materials .
Maintain the surface of the concrete as nearly horizontal as practical at all times .
To ensure thorough bonding place each succeeding layer before the preceding layer has taken its initial set .
Close the discharge end at the start of work to prevent water from entering the tube .
Induce the flow of concrete by slightly raising the tremie but always keeping the discharge end in the deposited concrete .
Stop the flow by lowering the tremie .
Provide a continuous flow and unless unavoidable do not interrupt it until completing the work .
The Department will allow dewatering when the concrete is sufficiently strong to withstand hydrostatic pressure but in no case in less than calendar days after placing or such additional length of time as the Engineer may direct .
Remove all laitance or other unsatisfactory material from the exposed surfaces by scraping chipping or other means which will not injure the concrete surface as the Engineer directs .
When it is necessary to use a concrete seal in construction of a foundation construct it as hereinafter described .
A concrete seal in a foundation is that volume of concrete placed under water by means of a tremie or other approved means for sealing the entire bottom area of the excavated pit within the cofferdam against hydrostatic pressure to dewater the excavation and construct the remainder of the foundation in dewatered forms .
Use Class A Modified concrete for the seal and in general make the thickness of the seal course .
times the hydrostatic head exerting pressure on the bottom of the foundation or of a thickness as specified in the Plans .
Place the corners of the seal to an elevation lower than the remaining surface of the seal course for the purpose of dewatering .
In such cases do not exceed an elevation difference between the corners and the remaining surface of inches .
C Placing Flowable Fill .
To place flowable fill requires a minimum trench width of inches clearance on each side of the pipe .
The Engineer will allow standing water to be in the trench when backfilling with flowable fill .
Deep trenches may require bleeder trenches or placement in layers to drain excess water .
Because certain types of pipe may float backfill in lifts or anchor the pipe when necessary .
Backfilling in lifts is more applicable to long lines of pipe allowing time for a substantial amount of the water to dissipate before applying the next lift .
The Department will allow the use of adequately spaced anchors made of small lumber or metal straps to anchor the pipe .
For larger diameter pipe it may be possible to maintain a surge of flowable fill on top of the pipe to prevent floating .
Floating usually does not occur after the level of the backfill is above the springline of the pipe .
Ensure that the pipe remains in the correct horizontal position and elevation .
Place flowable fill by discharging directly from truck chutes into the trench or place by means of conveyors buckets or pumps .
When pumping fill the voids adequately with solid particles to provide cohesion during the transport through the pump line under pressure to prevent segregation and line blockage .
Maintain continuous flow through the pump line to prevent segregation and line blockage .
Place the flowable fill from the top of the compacted bedding to the bottom of the pavement structure .
Unless the Engineer directs otherwise allow a minimum of hours before adding and compacting any material above the flowable fill .
To expedite settling and hardening in cool weather drain or pump the bleed water from the surface or overfill the trench to allow bleed water to flow out .
When overfilling remove all excess material after hardening .
The flowable fill will bleed water within to minutes after placement .
The release of water by bleeding causes the solid particles to realign and become firm .
A delay in bleeding indicates there are too many fines in the mixture or insufficient water .
If the maximum water was added reduce the fly ash quantity in increments of pounds until the mixture bleeds freely .
Add approximately pounds of sand to replace each pound increment of fly ash to maintain the original yield .
When increment reductions pounds total do not promote free bleeding of the mixture evaluate other possible remedies .
The flowable fill is too dry when cracks develop as it flows into place .
D Weather Limitations and Protection .
Designate an employee for the Engineer to contact in case of unexpected situations .
The Department reserves the right to discontinue concrete placement when the means of protection or method of placement does not produce satisfactory results .
Maintain the temperature of the mixture at or below F during placement .
Unless the Engineer determines that safety concerns or other considerations prohibit a shutdown cease concrete production when the mixture exceeds F until adequate methods are in place to reduce or maintain the mixture temperature .
Ensure that the temperature of the concrete mixture immediately before placing in bridges or box culverts is between and F. When the ambient air temperature is above F cool the temperature of the forms reinforcing steel steel beam flanges and other surfaces that will come in contact with the mixture to below F by means of a water spray or other approved methods .
Allow excess water to drain or remove it from the forms before placing concrete .
Do not place concrete in box culverts or bridges if the ambient temperature exceeds F. Maintain a minimum surface concrete temperature of F for calendar days after placement and at a minimum surface concrete temperature of F for an additional calendar days unless acceptable cylinder strength is achieved as determined by the engineer .
Do not place concrete during times of the year that ambient temperatures may be expected to drop below the F or F limits unless there are adequate provisions at the job site for maintaining concrete at the specified temperature .
Do not place concrete in contact with any material coated with frost or having a temperature of F or lower .
Submit a written plan detailing the methods to be used for protecting concrete for the Engineers review .
When performing cold weather concrete work provide and install recording thermometers or other approved temperature measuring devices .
In cold weather heat all water andor aggregate so the temperature of the mixed concrete is no less than F or more than F at the time of placement .
To avoid the possibility of flash set when water or aggregate is heated to above F mix the water and aggregate before adding the cement and do not exceed a temperature of F for the mixture of water and aggregate when adding the cement .
When using artificial heat provide a means to maintain adequate moisture in the air within the enclosure .
Maintain surfaces of all concrete in a moist condition as specified for curing during the entire curing period .
When using artificial heat do not exceed a temperature of F for concrete near the source of heat and maintain the temperature of concrete remote from the source of heat higher than the designated F or F for the time of curing after placement .
When using stoves or salamanders make adequate provisions for fire protection .
Assume all risk connected with placing concrete under these conditions and even with the Engineers permission to do the work take responsibility for proper results .
Should concrete placed under such conditions prove unsatisfactory remove and replace it with satisfactory concrete .
Do not use fly ash or Type P cement in bridge decks JPC pavement JPC base or JPC shoulders between November and March if the item is to be opened to public traffic and exposed to deicing salts .
If the item will remain closed to public traffic until the following spring or later the Department will allow the use of fly ash or Type P cement during this period .
.. Construction Joints .
A General Requirements for Structures .
When work of placing concrete is delayed until the concrete attains its initial set deem the point of stopping to be a construction joint .
Locate construction joints in the structure as specified in the Contract for the different types of structures but when the volume of concrete is too great to be placed without the use of additional construction joints locate and construct the additional construction joints without impairing the strength or appearance of the structure as the Engineer approves .
Avoid construction joints through paneled wingwalls or other surfaces to be treated architecturally .
To avoid visible joints as far as possible upon exposed faces finish the top surface of concrete adjacent to the forms by smoothing with a masons plastering trowel .
Where a featheredge might be produced at a construction joint as in the sloped top surface of a wingwall use an inset form work to produce a blocked out portion in the preceding layer that produces an edge thickness of inches or more in the succeeding layer .
Do not stop or temporarily discontinue work on any section or layer within inches below the top of any face unless details of the work provide for a coping having a thickness less than inches .
When the details provide for a coping having a thickness less than inches the Engineer may allow placement of the construction joint at the underside of the coping .
Whenever construction joints are required and in the opinion of the Engineer an insufficient quantity of reinforcement is projecting to secure satisfactory bond accomplish bonding as specified in B below .
B Bonding Construction Joints for Structures .
In joining fresh concrete to concrete that has already set or to preceding layers thoroughly clean the surface of work already in place of all laitance loose and foreign material .
Then wash and scrub this surface with wire brooms and thoroughly drench with water until saturated .
Keep the surface saturated until placing new concrete .
Immediately before placing new concrete draw all forms tight against concrete already in place .
After interrupting concrete placement and forming a construction joint interlock with the succeeding concrete by forming suitable keys in the concrete .
Form these keys by inserting and subsequently removing beveled wood strips .
Thoroughly saturate the wood strips with water before inserting them .
The Department may allow the use of steel dowels instead of keys .
The Engineer will determine the size and placement of keys and dowels .
C NonStructural Concrete Items .
When nonstructural concrete items are constructed on top of rigid pavement ensure that construction joints in the non structural items coincide with the pavement joints .
Install expansion joint material inch thick and cut it to conform to the cross section of the non structural item at all construction joints .
When a construction joint is within feet of a break in alignment or a drainage structure treat the construction joint as a contraction joint .
.. Falsework .
Design and construct falsework that provides the necessary rigidity supports the loads imposed and produces in the finished structure the lines and grades specified in the Plans .
Have a Registered Professional Engineer design all falsework that is not a Department standard design for structures with clear span lengths of feet or more and all falsework where traffic openings are specified .
Furnish the Engineer detailed working drawings in triplicate and design calculations for falsework .

.. Bolted Connections Using HighStrength Steel Bolts .
A General .
Use friction type joint for all connections made with highstrength steel bolts .
To determine the required bolt length add the grip the adjustment for bolt size specified in the following table inch for each hardened flat washer and inch for each beveled washer .
Grip is the total thickness of all connected materials exclusive of washers .
Then round up to the next inch length .
The adjustment in the above table allows for manufacturing tolerances and for the use of a heavy hexagon nut and provides adequate stick through at the end of the bolt .
Provide adequate bolt length to allow for the exposure of at least complete threads beyond the face of the nut after tightening .
Where necessary clip washers on one side and no closer than .
of the bolt diameter from the center of the washer .
Install bolts with a hardened washer under the nut or bolt head whichever is the element turned in tightening .
The Department will allow the use of a flat washer when the abutting surface adjacent to the bolt head or nut does not have a slope of more than with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis .
Where outer faces of the bolted parts have a slope of more than with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis use a smooth beveled washer to compensate for BOLT SIZE ADJUSTMENT Nominal Bolt Size Adjustment for Bolt Size inch inch lack of parallelism .
Ensure that bolted parts fit solidly together when assembled and are not separated by gaskets or any other interposed compressible material .
Keep all joint surfaces free of dirt burrs and other defects that would prevent solid seating of the parts .
Maintain contact surfaces free of oil excess primer and any other foreign matter .
Tighten all bolts with properly calibrated wrenches to provide at least the required minimum bolt tension values shown in the following table on completion of the joint .
Set the calibrated wrenches used to provide the bolt tension specified in the table above so as to induce a bolt tension at least percent in excess of this value .
Calibrate the wrenches twice daily by tightening in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension no less than typical bolts from the lot to be installed .
Adjust power wrenches to stall or cutout at the selected tension .
When using manual torque wrenches note the torque indication corresponding to the calibrating tension and use it in the installation of all bolts of the tested lot .
When measuring torque keep nuts in tightening motion .
For shortgrip bolts the Department will allow calibration of wrenches by using directtension indicating washers with solid plates in a manner acceptable to the Engineer .
When using calibrated wrenches to install several bolts in a single joint use the wrench to touch up bolts previously tightened which may have been loosened by tightening of the subsequent bolts until all are tightened to the prescribed amount .
When required because of bolt entering and wrench operation clearances tighten by turning the bolt while preventing the nut from rotating .
Furnish all tension machines and torque wrenches .
The Engineer will approve the procedure for calibration of wrenches .
Operate a manual torque wrench as the Engineer spot inspects installed bolts by observing the indicated torque .
Use a torque wrench that has been calibrated as previously described in this subsection .
When the Engineer is inspecting bolts apply the inspecting wrench and its required torque to percent of the bolts but not less than bolts selected at random in a connection .
The Engineer will accept the connection as properly tightened if the nut or bolt head does not turn when applying the required torque .
When applying the required torque and a nut or bolt turns the Engineer will test all bolts in the connection .
Tighten all bolts whose nut or bolt head is turned by the required torque .
The Engineer will reinspect all connections whose nut or bolt head is turned by the required torque .
Alternatively the Department will allow retightening of all of the bolts BOLT TENSION Nominal Bolt Size inch Minimum Bolt Tension ASTM A Bolts KIPS ASTM A Bolts KIPS in the connection and then resubmit the connection for the Engineer to inspect .
Store bolts and nuts in a dry location until use to protect them from contamination by foreign substances and the formation of rust .
Only open shipping containers when needed for the work or for inspection purposes .
Properly cover and store partially used containers to avoid contamination or exposure to moisture .
Only install bolts and nuts that are clean and free of excessive rust .
Do not consider a thin tightly adhering rust as cause to require cleaning however apply a dry lubricant to the threads and bearing surface of all nuts to be used when either bolts or nuts show evidence of rust on the threads .
In lieu of using calibrated wrenches the Department will allow the use of the turnofnut method to install bolts .
During installation regardless of the tightening method used install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition .
Snug tight is the tightness that exists when the plies of the joint are in firm contact .
Attain this condition either by a few impacts of an impact wrench or by the full effort of an ordinary spud wrench .
When snug tightening progress systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges and then retighten the bolts of the connection in a similar systematic manner as necessary until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully connected .
When using turnofnut tightening Check a representative sample of not less than three bolt and nut assemblies of each diameter length and grade at the start of work in a device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Use the test to demonstrate that the method for estimating the snug tight condition and controlling the turns from snug tight to be used by the bolting crew to develop a tension not less than percent greater than the required tension specified in table above .
After bringing to a snug tight condition further tighten all bolts in the connection by the applicable amount of rotation specified in the following table .
During the tightening operation do not allow any rotation of the part not turned by the wrench .
When tightening progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
Nut rotation is relative to bolt regardless whether turning the element nut or bolt .
For installing bolts by half turn and less the tolerance is for installing bolts by twothirds turn and more the tolerance is .
Applicable only to connections in which all material within the turn grip of the bolt is steel .
There is no research available to establish the turnofnut procedure for bolt lengths exceeding diameters .
Therefore determine the required rotation by NUT ROTATION FROM SNUG TIGHT CONDITIONS Bolt Length Disposition of Outer Faces of Bolted Parts Under side of head to end of bolt .
Both faces normal to bolt axis One face normal to bolt axis and other sloped not more than beveled washer not used Both faces sloped not more than from normal to the bolt axis beveled washer not used Up to and including diameters turn turn turn Over diameters but not exceeding diameters turn turn turn Over diameters but not exceeding diameters turn turn turn actual test in a suitable tension measuring device that simulates conditions of solidly fitted steel .
Perform the rotationalcapacity test described in Section on each rotationalcapacity lot prior to the start of bolt installation .
Use hardened steel washers for the test even if they are not required in the actual installation procedures .
Verify that a visible lubricant is on the threads of galvanized nuts .
Ensure that black bolts are oily to the touch when delivered and installed .
Before installing clean and relubricate weathered or rusted bolts or nuts not conforming to the requirements of the rotationalcapacity test .
Retreat recleaned or relubricated nut and washer assemblies to conform to rotationalcapacity test requirements before installing .
Use bolt nut and washer when required combinations from the same lot used for the rotationalcapacity test .
B Direct Tension Indicators .
When specified in the Plans the Department will allow tightening all highstrength bolts in diameters of inch through inch inclusive using direct tension indicators .
Before work begins furnish the Engineer with the manufacturers written installation instructions .
Install direct tension indicators and tighten the bolts according to these instructions .
Under normal conditions install the tension indicator under the nonturned element of the fastening system .
Obtain the Engineers permission before installing tension indicators under the turned element .
If the Engineer determines that it is necessary to install the tension indicator under the turned element install additional hardened washers according to the manufacturers instructions .
Use bolt lengths sufficient to accommodate the tension indicators and any additional washers required .
Do not reuse tension indicators .
If it becomes necessary to loosen a previously tensioned bolt discard and replace the tension indicator .
The fastener assembly may also need to be replaced .
Furnish a device capable of measuring actual bolt tension .
Before work begins tighten at least typical bolts and direct tension indicators in the device to the correct bolt tension .
Keep the tension device available thereafter for additional checks when the Engineer deems necessary .
The Engineer will inspect bolt installation by inserting a feeler gage into the opening between adjacent flattened protrusions .
The Engineer will examine at least percent but no less than of the bolts in each connection .
The Engineer will consider the installation acceptable if the gage will not enter the opening .
The Engineer will not consider a zero gap as cause for rejection .
If the gap is not uniform around the bolt the Engineer will base acceptance on the average gap .
That is the Engineer will check the gap at several points around the bolt and if the gage will not enter the gap on at least half the tries the installation will be acceptable .
Seal the gap behind the indicator completely with paint .
If necessary use moisture cure aluminum polyurethane intermediate coat at that location .
Furnish tension indicators in addition to washers when specified in the Contract .
.. Reuse of ASTM A Bolts .
The Department will allow the use of non galvanized ASTM A highstrength bolts one additional time after initially tightening them to specification tension provided a close visual inspection indicates no distress in the bolt .
This allows nongalvanized ASTM A bolts to remain installed when tightened to specification tension twice one time at original installation and one time at reuse .
Do not consider touching up or retightening previously tightened bolts which may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts as reuse providing the snugging up continues from the initial position .
When removing and loosening a bolt after it has been tightened to specification tension twice discard the bolt and substitute a new bolt .
Reuse of galvanized ASTM A bolts is not allowed .
Reuse of any type of ASTM A bolt is not allowed .
.. Welds .
Perform all welding when authorized according to requirements specified in ANSIAASHTOAWS D. Bridge Welding Code current edition with interims .

A Edge Planing .
Plane to a depth of inch all sheared edges of plates that are more than inch thick and carry calculated stress .
The Department will allow fillet reentranting cuts before cutting .
B Flame Cutting .
Obtain a smooth surface free from cracks and notches and an accurate profile using a mechanical guide and the Department will allow flame cutting of steel .
Only perform flame cutting by hand where the Engineer approves .
Smooth the surface by planing chipping or grinding .
Adjust and manipulate the cutting flame to avoid cutting beyond the prescribed lines .
Fillet reentrant cuts to a radius of no less than inch .
Do not allow the surface roughness value of oxygen cut surfaces to be greater than that specified in ANSIASME B. as follows Material Thickness Less than inch MU inch Surface Roughness Value to inches MU inch for ends of members not subject to calculated stress at the ends conform to the surface roughness value of MU inches .
Remove roughness exceeding these values and occasional notches or gouges no more than inch deep on otherwise satisfactory surfaces by machining or grinding .
Leave cut surfaces and edges free of slag .
Remove irregularity or unevenness from defects to the oxygen cut surfaces with a slope not exceeding one in .
Do not repair defects in oxygencut edges by welding except with the Engineers approval .

Preheat members in the area to be cut to a minimum temperature of F to prevent edge cracks .
Allow sufficient additional width to permit planing chipping or grinding to remove rough burned cracked or otherwise defective edges .
Grind corners at flame cut edges to a radius of at least inch and remove any evidence of edge cracking by planing chipping or grinding to a depth not exceeding inch .
C Heat Curving .
The fabricator may either fabricate welded girders by flame cutting the flanges to the required curvature from rectangular plates before fitting and welding to the web or fabricate welded girders or rolled beams by fabricating straight units and then through the application of heat to the flange edges induce the required curvature .
Do not perform heat curving in beams or girders fabricated from steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum yield point greater than psi or in beams or girders having a radius shorter than the minimum radius of curvature as determined by the procedures outlined in the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges .
When the Contract requires heat curving rolled beams or welded girders ensure that the work conforms to the following requirements .
Curve beams and girders by either continuous or Vtype heating .
For the continuous method simultaneously heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flanges .
Ensure that the strip is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
For the Vtype heating heat the top and bottom flanges in truncated triangular areas having their bases along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
Determine the spacing and temperature of the areas necessary to obtain the specified curvature .
Apply heat along the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate .
For Vtype heating terminate the apex of each truncated triangular area applied to the inside of a flange surface just before reaching the juncture of the web and the flange .
To avoid unnecessary web distortion carefully heat the inside flange surfaces the surfaces that intersect the web to avoid applying heat directly to the web .
When the radius of curvature is feet or more extend the apex of each truncated triangular heating area applied to the outside of a flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than feet extend the apex of each truncated triangular heating area applied to the outside of a flange surface past the web for a distance equal to of the flange width or inches whichever is less .
Ensure that each truncated triangular area has an included angle of approximately to degrees however do not allow the length of the base of each triangle to exceed inches .
Obtain the Engineers approval before making any variation in the patterns as prescribed in this subsection .
For both types of heating heat the flange areas that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve .
Concurrently heat both surfaces of flanges when the flange thickness is inch or greater .
Space the heating patterns uniformly along the full length of each flange to produce a uniform arc of a circular curve in the member .
When heating causes a chording effect that the Engineer judges not aesthetically pleasing ensure that the fabricator reheats the member using additional heating patterns as required to obtain the desired results .
Conduct the heatcurving operation so that temperature of the steel does not exceed F. Confine heating to the patterns or areas specified in this section and apply heat to bring the steel within the patterns or areas to the required temperature as rapidly as possible without overheating the steel .
Consider any heating procedure which causes a portion of the steel to be heated to a temperature greater than F as destructive heating and as a possible cause for rejection of the steel .
The fabricator may propose to the Engineer various means to reaccept repair or replace the steel rejected for overheating .
The Engineer will review the fabricators proposal .
Do not artificially cool the steel until it has cooled naturally to F. Never quench the steel with water or water and air .
When appropriate cool the steel with dry compressed air only after it has cooled to F. The fabricator shall maintain temperature controls using temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means during heating and cooling of the steel .
The Department will allow heat curving of beams and girders with the web in either a vertical or horizontal position .
When heat curving beams and girders in the vertical position brace or support them in such a manner that the tendency to deflect laterally during the heatcurving process will not cause them to overturn .
When heat curving beams and girders in the horizontal position support them near the ends and at intermediate points as required to obtain a uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of a beam or girder to exceed psi .
When a beam or girder is positioned horizontally for heating maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength within inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
Heat curve beams and girders in the fabrication shop before painting .
The Department will allow performing of the heatcurving operation either before or after completing all required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners .
However unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage locate and attach all connection plates and bearing stiffeners after heat curving .
When the Engineer requires longitudinal stiffeners heat curve or flame cut them to the required radius and then weld them to the curved girder .
When attaching cover plates to rolled beams attach them before heat curving when the total thickness of one flange and cover plates is less than inches and the radius of curvature is greater than feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates heat curve the beams before attaching the cover plates either heat curve or oxygen cut cover plates separately and then weld them to the curved beams .
Camber girders before heat curving .
Obtain camber for rolled beams by heatcambering or coldcambering methods approved by the Engineer .
For welded plate or builtup girders cut the web to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat curving .
The curving process may tend to change the existing vertical camber .
This change will be most pronounced when the top and bottom flanges are of unequal widths on a given transverse cross section .
However subject to approval of the Engineer correct moderate deviations from the specified camber by a carefully supervised application of heat .
The Engineer will not measure horizontal curvature and vertical camber for final acceptance until after the fabricator has completed all welding and heating operations and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
The Engineer will check the horizontal curvature in each edge of each flange with the beam or girder in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a stringline or wire or by using other suitable means .
