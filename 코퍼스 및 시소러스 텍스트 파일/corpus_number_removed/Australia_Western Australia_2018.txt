SETTING OUT INFORMATION Clause . .
The Project Manager must ensure that Road Reference Marks RRMs have been established during preconstruction and are available for construction .
If not then action should be taken to establish the RRMs to the required Main Roads Survey Standard . .
If the RRMs are to be established as a separate survey prior to construction then it is essential that the marks are connected to the original geodetic survey network that was used to define the ground model for design .
This may have only been a minor control traverse .
Further information for these requirements can be obtained from the Senior Geodetic Surveyor . .
Coordinate values of RRMs are available from the Survey Portal within the Survey and Mappings Standards section of the Main Roads Website available at www.mainroads.wa.gov.au .
It is the Project Managers responsibility to ensure the co ordinate values of the RRMs have remained unaltered since establishment to ensure that no ambiguities arise between the Contractors surveyor and Main Roads survey representatives . .
The Project Manager must be aware of the need for the project to be designed and supplied in its respective Main Roads WA approved Project Zone Coordinate System GDA .
The Project Manager must ensure all spatially referenced data e.g .
RRMs design models Drawings and amendments are supplied in their nominated Project Zone. . MX GENIO default output Double Precision D. output is the standard MX output that will ensure the integrity of the digital model is retained .
It is the Contractors responsibility to convert this data into any other required digital output for its needs . .
The Principal shall not supply String Reports MX Minor Option Cross Section Reports MX Minor Option or Geometry Reports MX Minor Option for setting out the Works .

Principal Responsibilities Under the OSH Act the Principal has the capacity to exercise control and is also responsible for ensuring a safe and healthy working environment on construction sites .
A key element of that responsibility is to identify hazards assess the risks and determine suitable controls. . National Standard for Construction Work Under the OSH Regulations Division of Part Construction industry consultation on hazards and safety management outlines the responsibilities of Designers Clause .
Main Contractors Clause .
and Clients Clause .. ..
Responsibilities of Designers Clause .
Designers must forward to the Client a written report that identifies all hazards arising from the design Specification Occupational Safety and Health Issued Document No Dxxxxxxx Page of Contract No xxxxxx Contract Name assessment of the risks arising from the hazards action taken to reduce the hazard risks and any hazards identified but have not been resolved .
The PM must ensure that they receive a detailed report from the Designer appropriate for the nature of the hazard and degree of risk for each design .
The PM must then determine how the hazards detailed in the Design Report are communicated to the Contractor in contract specific requirements in the Principals Identified Hazards in Annexure A andor to include the Design Report in the Information for Tenderers .
The hazards identified in the Design Report must be addressed in the Contractors OSH Management Plan .
..
Responsibilities of Main Contractor Clause .
The Main Contractor must as far as practicable ensures that all hazard records are maintained assess the risk of injury from the hazards take action by means to reduce the risks .
It is therefore a requirement of this Specification that a The Project Manager or Superintendent shall ensure appropriate risk assessment for all foreseeable hazards have been identified and risk potential determined by competent team members in sufficient detail b Based on the outcome of the risk assessment the Specification will be added to in prescribed Clauses to reflect the risk profile and c The risk assessment will be forwarded to the Superintendents nd party OSH Auditor when the Contract OSH Management Plans suitability is assessed to ensure the auditor is aware of the critical issues associated with the Contract .
..
Responsibilities of the Client Clause .
The Client must consult with the Designer and Main Contractor that persons doing the construction work may do so without risk to their health and safety .

The Custodian of this specification is the Principal Design Engineer Regional Support. . GENERAL When setting out the extent of clearing and demolition works it is important to carefully consider the management of the existing site vegetation .
Clearing must be conducted in accordance with the Clearing Permit and the area approved in the Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment PEIA. . CLEARING PERMIT The Environmental Protection Clearing of Native Vegetation Regulations and associated amendments to the Environmental Protection Act includes limits and conditions on obtaining permits for the clearing of native vegetation .
For more details on the requirements and on the clearing exemptions refer to the Main Roads Environmental Guideline Native Vegetation Clearing Regulations and Permits Document No . .
The Project Manager MUST ensure that an authorised clearing permit is secured for the clearing works and a copy of the permit is provided to the Contractor in the Information for Tenderers or at Contract Award .
The clearing permit shall be for all works under the Contract including the clearing of sidetracks and temporary work areas and be referenced in Specification TRAFFIC .
The Contractor shall be required to include a copy of the clearing permit with the Hold Point submission .
The contractual implications of not having a permit prior to the start of the clearing works include time delays and costs. . VEGETATION CLEARING Table A. should be completed to provide a specific schedule of clearing widths and the treatment of cleared vegetation if these details are not clearly shown in the Drawings .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Clearing Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue A detailed schedule is critical in environmentally sensitive areas and diebackaffected areas where it is important to minimise the impacts and extent of clearing .
Clearing and Topsoil Management Drawings should be prepared as part of the design documentation for all work projects .
Ensure the sidetracks are also pegged out . .
EXTENT OF CLEARING AND LIMITATION It is important to ensure that the Drawings clearly show the full extent of clearing necessary at the top of the batter e.g .
to allow for windrow of topsoil and to include a typical cross section showing the limit of the clearing .
The Drawings must include only the extent of clearing described in the clearing permit environmental approvals . .
TREATMENT OF CLEARED VEGETATION .
General One or more of the following treatments for cleared vegetation may be applicable as determined by the specific site conditions e.g .
soil and vegetation type and project requirements .
Disposal of unwanted vegetation off site e.g .
disease and or weed infected or excess to the quantity of mulch required for the works .
Chipping of vegetation and or shrub rolling of vegetation shrubs and groundcovers and incorporation of the vegetation disease and weedfree into the existing topsoil for stockpiling and later respread .
Chipping and stockpiling of cleared vegetation disease and weedfree for later respread as mulch over batter slopes and cleared surfaces .
In some locations e.g .
in sandy heath vegetation the most cost effective treatment is by rolling over the existing shrub and understory vegetation insitu and in the process roughly incorporating the vegetation into the existing topsoil with suitable land clearing equipment .
The appropriate treatment must be determined in the design process and be documented in the Drawings e.g .
clearing and topsoil management plan or as an Annexure. . Salvageable Material If the salvage and disposal of timber logs to timber mills is to form part of the clearing operations undertaken by the Contractor it is suggested a Provisional Sum be provided to cover the costs over and above the clearing operations to cover felling of the trees any handling temporary storage and transport to a timber mill .
Include a clause under the treatment of cleared vegetation to cover any necessary arrangements to be made and the salvage value of the timber. . Cartage and Stockpiling of Cleared Vegetation Cleared vegetation shall be removed and shall be stacked in neat manageable stockpiles at approved locations .
The temporary stockpiling of the cleared vegetation shall be minimised and cartage to the final stockpile location shall be undertaken as MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Clearing Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue soon as possible after the clearing operations and within days after clearing to minimise drop of viable seed material that is useful for revegetation to the ground. . Chipping of Cleared Vegetation All diseasefree and weedfree cleared vegetation as nominated in the Drawings or Annexure A for chipping into organic mulch shall be reduced in size by chipping splitting cutting mowing slashing grinding etc .
to useable mulch material .
The average grade size shall be between mm mm with no individual pieces greater than mm .
No woody and herbaceous weed species shall be included into the chipped material .
Chipping of vegetation shall be undertaken as soon as possible after the clearing operations and within days after clearing to avoid excessive drying out of the material. . TRANSPLANTING Where appropriate transplanting of certain desirable vegetation e.g .
grass trees can be used to preserve a scarce or attractive native plant type local to the area .
Lifting and temporary storage of the target species can be carried out prior to the main clearing operations and transplanting to final location can be made part of Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING .
Insert a listing of the locations of any individual plant to be transplanted as Annexure A .
A suggested clause for the transplanting of grass trees Xanthorrhoea is given in Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING .
Requirements for other species would be similar but should be checked for accuracy with the Main Roads Landscape Architect .
Include a measure and payment items and note the HOLD POINT for temporary storage. . PROTECTION OF EXISTING VEGETATION Insert a listing of the locations of any vegetation to be retained and protected during the clearing operations include protection details as Table A . . DEMOLITION ITEMS Annexure B should be completed to provide a specific schedule of demolition item locations and details .
Particular items for demolition should also be listed e.g .
old kerbing fencing stock grids etc .
Note that Specification DISMANTLING DEMOLITION should be used where existing bridges and associated structures are involved . .
SUITABLE STOCKPILE LOCATIONS Insert a listing of suitable stockpile locations for the storage of cleared vegetation as Annexure C. It is recommended that the preferred locations for stockpiling of materials be identified by the Principal to minimise potential environment impacts .
The Contractor may nominate alternative sites subject to the Superintendents approval that the sites comply with the specifications .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Clearing Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue Sites for the stockpiling and storage of vegetation must be managed to ensure that the properties of the vegetation are not degraded and made unsuitable for use in the revegetation and landscaping works e.g .
by weed infestation of the stockpiles .
Refer to Figure C. Typical Cross Section for Stockpiles of Chipped Vegetation .
Stockpiling and storage of cleared vegetation must not occur on uncleared native vegetation. . ESTIMATING THE VOLUME OF VEGETATION TO BE CLEARED An estimate of the expected volume of cleared vegetation will provide an estimate of the required stockpile area .
The following estimates are based on prior experience in the local land clearing industry .
Heavy vegetation Forest well timbered mha Medium vegetation Banksia woodland mha Light vegetation scrubland wattles mha Area m of stockpile required estimate of total volume of cleared vegetationheight of stockpiles .m .
Allow for access for placing materials and management of stockpiles of chipped vegetation to be in accordance with FIGURE C. TYPICAL CROSS SECTION FOR STOCKPILES OF CHIPPED VEGETATION in Annexure C. For mixed vegetation cover i.e .
varied across the project area the estimate of volume should be based on the above rates and the area of cover .
In South West forest areas the vegetation cover may get heavier up to mha .
Chipping machinery hp can chip up to mm diameter tree trunks . .
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL Erosion and sedimentation control measures may be a requirement in advance of or in conjunction with clearing and grubbing operations .
Note that a separate Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan should be prepared where erosion control operations are required .
Refer to Guidance notes in Specification EARTHWORKS. . WEED CONTROL The control of undesirable weed species e.g .
declared species may be a requirement prior to clearing operations .
Insert a listing of any known locations for weed control include details as Annexure A. and include a note that weed species may include but are not limited to any listing of nominated weed species identified in Table A ..
The Contractor must identify all weed species within the Contract area and prepare a Weed Control Program for approval by the Superintendent .
Advice on appropriate herbicide use should be sought from an environmental specialist in the area .
Acceptance criteria for weed control shall be as a minimum The approved weed control program has been implemented to the satisfaction of the Superintendent .

TOPSOIL REMOVAL STORAGE AND RESPREAD .
Sufficient topsoil should be stripped from the Site andor imported to provide a supply of suitable growing medium to support vegetation for use in revegetation and landscaping works. . AS is the recommended standard for defining the requirements of soils for landscaping use and the testing of soil properties .
The conditioning improvement of topsoil and supply of imported topsoil is covered in Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING. . Only the upper to millimetres of a Site soil layer is usually biologically active and of the greatest value in revegetation and landscaping .
This is only the O and A soil horizons refer to Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook McDonald et al .
It is important that a this active topsoil layer and the subsoil is not mixed in the stripping and stockpiling process b stockpiling is limited to the minimum practical period c the height of topsoil stockpiles and batter slopes are limited as per Figure D. d the properties of stockpiled topsoil are not degraded by weed infestation and or erosion . .
The stripping and handling of topsoil should ideally only occur when the field soil moisture content is optimum for the particular soil texture class .
Movement of soil that is too wet or dry may result in the loss of topsoil properties that are important for the effective use in revegetation and landscaping e.g .
stripping dry sandy soil will result in mixing of the topsoil and subsoil layers unless care is taken .
Measures to improve the workability of the soil may be required i.e .
allowing the soil to dry out or watering to bind dry soil and control dust. . Sites for the stockpiling and storage of topsoil must be managed to ensure that the properties of the topsoil are not degraded and made unsuitable for use in the revegetation and landscaping works e.g .
by soil erosion and or weed infestation of the stockpiles .
Refer to Figure D. Typical Cross Section for Stockpiles of Topsoil. . Control of soil erosion and weed invasion may require the consideration of onsite surface drainage the potential use of protective covers e.g .
hydromulch or seeding with a temporary cover crop or by spreading of insitu or imported vegetation mulch and weed control measures .
More details are provided in the Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING . .
The rehabilitation of all batter and ground surfaces including respread of topsoil site topsoil andor imported topsoil shall be in accordance with specification clauses for Rehabilitation . .
It is critical that soil used for revegetation is stable and the physical properties provide a suitable growing medium to support vegetation .
Soil types vary across the state but as a general rule the proportion of oversized soil material larger than mm in size should be limited to a minimum .
a for broad scale revegetation areas to be direct seeded or for planting by tube stock with native species most of the soil material should ideally pass a mm sieve .
b for general landscape plantings most of the soil material should pass a mm sieve and for grassed areas a mm sieve .

SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS .
Unless specified otherwise in the Contract the sequence of operations before commencing the topsoil removal shall be a confirm areas of topsoil to be removed with Superintendent .
b scalp and remove topsoil areas with nominated weeds and or dieback .
c remove topsoil to be respread. . Dieback and weed infected soil shall be handled separately to minimise the risk of spreading weed species across the Site or into other areas .
Cleaning down of machinery before and between operations is essential to prevent the introduction and spread of weeds or dieback. . Weed control operations shall occur in accordance with Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING. . Dieback control measures shall occur in accordance with Specification ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS . .
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL .
Project environmental commitments include the requirements to control Site erosion and sedimentation into natural drainage lines .
This may require the installation of temporary and or permanent control measures .
The Project Manager should arrange for an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan to be prepared for the Works .
The Contractor should be required to install and maintain the measures contained within the Plan before any section of the earthworks proceeds .
Seek advice if required from the Environment Branch . .
The Project Manager must ensure that the design slopes of batters are suitable for the proposed revegetation measures .
Key locations for attention are steep batter slopes where subsoil rock and groundwater may cause instability of topsoil and vegetation . .
Steep and long slopes increase surface runoff and downslope transport of surface soil .
Surface roughening and benching of bare soil by creating furrows across slopes terracing or by surface roughing tracking the soil surface reduces erosion potential by decreasing runoff velocities trapping sediment and increasing infiltration of water into the soil and will facilitate effective mulching seeding and planting. . During the formation layer compaction process leave mm of rough and uncompacted soil at ends to assist in the revegetation of the batter surfaces .
Cut batters greater than metre height shall be benched or stepped to provide drainage and erosion control and detailed in the Drawings .
The floor of the bench shall not vary by more than the nominated tolerances and the bench must drain away from the lowest cut face and provide for longitudinal drainage .
Benches shall be maintained free of loose materials until the finishing of batters and ground surfaces. . Where random rock outcrops occur leave these on the batter and bench up to both sides .
Leaving the natural rock face exposed and revegetating the remaining benched batters can make a considerable improvement to the overall appearance of the cuttings . .
RETAINING TREES IN CUT OR FILL SLOPES .
If the retention of existing large trees in cut or fill is a requirement of the Contract this work shall be undertaken in accordance with Specification MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Earthworks Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING and confirmed with the Superintendent prior to any earthworks within the canopy of the vegetation. . USE OF SURPLUS MATERIALS .
Main Roads often pays to have spoil carted off site that could have been used to improve the safety of the new road by reducing batter slopes and filling deep medians etc .
Unsuitable road building material can often be used to enhance batter slopes or sheet grass affected verges to allow revegetation to be undertaken. . Where there is surplus material the Superintendent may authorise the use of the excess material to flatten embankment batter slopes fill depressions or cover unwanted grassed areas to facilitate revegetation. . Contract specific requirements and the PM to identify suitable areas for use of surplus materials. . SPOIL SITES .
Only spoil sites that are authorised waste disposal sites are to be used for the disposal of contaminated soil and weedinfested soil. . REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING .
Refer to the Main Roads environmental guideline Revegetation Planning and Techniques Document no .
for guidance on the planning and implementation of revegetationlandscaping works. . Project requirements for the extent of revegetationlandscaping works will vary .
a In pastoral regions basic topsoil management and weed control would be the expected minimum level of treatment .
b In agricultural regions some level of seeding andor planting and weed control would be the expected minimum level of treatment .
c In urban areas a higher standard of revegetationlandscaping is the expected minimum level of treatment. . Revegetation and landscaping works may be managed as a separable portion of a roadwork andor bridgework construction contract or as a standalone minor works contract. . Where revegetationlandscaping works form part of a roadwork andor bridgework construction contract a Ensure suitable specifications and drawings are prepared for incorporation into the main contract documentation .
b Ensure the documentation includes any appropriate crossreferencing of specifications e.g .
clearing and earthworks requirements .
c Ensure that a vegetation establishment period is nominated in the Special Conditions of Contract to supplement the defects liability period in the Conditions of Contract. . Where the project works are limited to respreading topsoil and chipped vegetation as mulch and weed control then ensure adequate completion criteria are clearly nominated e.g .
erosion control and weed control as a basis for handover of the site for any additional revegetationlandscaping works .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Earthworks Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue .
Where revegetationlandscaping will occur as a standalone works contract refer to Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING for further guidance. . All mulching planting seeding and or weed control operations shall be undertaken in accordance with Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING. . All hydromulching operations shall be undertaken in accordance with Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING .
LIME STABILISATION refer to Clause . . Lime stabilisation of earthworks layers is not commonly used .

This method uses hydrated lime for the laboratory testing and includes reference to a methodology for determining the percentage of lime that must be added if another type of lime e.g .
quick lime is used in the field .
c Determine the UCS of the stabilised material in accordance with Main Roads Test Method WA .. d The optimum Lime content of the soil for stabilisation must satisfy both the Minimum Lime Content to achieve long term stabilisation at Step b only applicable to expansive soil and the of lime that must be added to the soil to produce a day UCS at Step c falling in the range .MPa to .MPa .
e Should the Lime Demand test require a of lime that results in a day cured UCS that exceeds .MPa then lime stabilisation must not be used only applicable to expansive soil .
The minimum practical spread rate that can be achieved by most lime spreaders is kgm which equates to approximately lime for laterite gravel stabilised to a depth of mm .

The plan must be prepared by an experienced person and reviewed by the Main Roads regional environment officer or the Main Roads Environment Branch .
The plan must be prepared and approved prior to the start of pit site operations .
Consultation with landholders or land managers must be included in the preparation of the plan and in determining completion criteria .
Completion criteria give the Superintendent something to measure against if the works are completed by Contract .
On CALM land Main Roads is required to achieve a certain plant coverage or survival rate .
Other requirements may apply on private land e.g .
return to pasture or timber plantation or alternative crop .
If the Environmental Management Plan does not nominate any rehabilitation completion criteria then the revegetation should be in accordance with the completion criteria in Specification REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING .
Seek the advice of the Environment Branch to assist in the determination of the appropriate rehabilitation treatment and ensure the SMM clauses include a suitable reference to any additional requirements .
For further guidance refer to the Environmental Guideline Pits and Quarries prepared by the Main Roads Environment Branch .

MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING ROADS MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Pits Quarries Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue If a severe impact on a public road is anticipated due to heavy haulage maintenance of the road can be included i.e .
where a public road forms part of a major haul road the road shall be maintained to the same standard as at the date of Possession of Site .
Insert a suitable clause in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS . .
REINSTATEMENT OF ROCKY GROUND IN PITS OR QUARRIES The treatment for extensive rock base that can not be ripped will depend on the pit location drainage and what revegetation is to occur .
Usual practice is to build up the landform to allow vegetation to establish e.g .
metre depth by the return of the overburden topsoil and vegetation cleared from the pit site .
The Environmental Management Plan should identify the suitable treatment on a sitespecific basis e.g .
if rock outcrops naturally occur in the area then exposed rock may be acceptable .

ANNEXURE C This sets out the completion criteria for the Works .
Complete the details for each of the completion criteria provided in the template tables to match the specific site and contract requirements .
The Project Manager must ensure that completion criteria are determined for the works in the project planning and design process .
The generic process for setting completion criteria is outlined in the Main Roads environmental guideline Revegetation Planning and techniques Document no . .
Completion criteria and the nominated requirements are customised to specific zones within the project area e.g .
batters drainage basins medians roadside verge or planting seeding or grassing areas and are based on the design drawings .
Key steps are Set the management objective by defined zones within the project area .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Revegetation Landscaping Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue Set the target to be achieved for each zone based on the condition of existing vegetation adjacent to the site or project commitments .
Nominate the completion criteria for each zone .
A zone is an area of varying size but with uniform characteristics .
In any given project zones can be separated by treatments received e.g .
planting seeding grassing soil types slope angle position in the landscape watershedding or wateraccumulating or a maximum size e.g .
up to m. The number of representative plots and the plot size i.e .
two representative plots m x m or equal area or of the zone area per nominated zone within the project area are defined during the design process and are based on the design drawings .
The layout of the representative plots must reflect the shape of the area and the type of vegetation .
Plot and size should relate to the overall area ha of the project site e.g .
say if siteha and if ha .
The expected mean number of plant stems will vary by project area and according to seeding rate and the species used .
The sample figures provided in section for Annexure C are nominal for urban or agricultural regions .
The figures nominated for a project must be estimated to match the plant and seed list and the density of vegetation cover that naturally occurs in the project area .
In arid areas where rainfall variability is high the spacing between individual plants will tend to be greater with more areas of bare soil than occurs in the agricultural regions with regular seasonal rainfall and low rainfall variability .
Note that the requirement for the each zone varies for each stage during the Vegetation Establishment Period .
Amend the template tables provided to match the specific site and contract requirements .
Insert the relevant Completion Criteria for the Works . .
TIMING OF WORKS The timing of the works is fundamental to its effectiveness .
Revegetationlandscaping should occur at the optimal time for the Region when the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment and as soon as practical after soil preparation .
Generally this is limited to match the seasonal rains otherwise watering must be allowed for .
It is important that the Superintendent ensure the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment before allowing seeding operations to start .
Timing of the work including the ordering and acquisition of materials is dependent on seasonal conditions and the progress of road construction works .
Project timetables often mean that a delay occurs between the end of road works and the optimal time to start the revegetationlandscaping works .
Where a delay is necessary the hold over period must be planned and budgeted for prior to finalising the contract .
Tasks like weed control stabilisation of batters plant and seed supply may be necessary during the hold over period .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Revegetation Landscaping Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue The general sequence of works is weed control soil preparation plantingseedinggrassing and vegetation establishment prior to handover for ongoing maintenance .
Advice and support can be obtained from the Manager Environment Branch .
The optimal time for the works should be specified in the Annexure B. . CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE OF THE WORKS The surveillance and control of the contract works is essential to achieve the design objectives and value for money .

PREPARATION OF SOIL SURFACES Revegetation and landscaping may follow on from new road works or be undertaken within an established roadside or borrow pit .
The management of the existing site vegetation and topsoil and weed control activities during clearing and earthworks can facilitate or make revegetation more difficult .
Where revegetation follows on from new road works it is critical to ensure that the specifications for CLEARING and EARTHWORKS are coordinated with and complement the REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING Specifications .
Where revegetation occurs within an established roadside the soil preparation and weed control occurs in response to the site conditions and reflected in the design drawings and Specifications. . WATERING Revegetation is like growing agricultural crops and subject to the local weather conditions .
Wherever practical watering in the first growing season to complement the rainfall should be used to promote the establishment of vegetation .
The Superintendent should confirm the water source quality potable if available and watering system proposed by the Contractor .
There are four general types of irrigation for possible use in revegetation works .
Sprinkler systems relatively costly need to be designed and good water supply .
Drip or Trickle system less cost temporary permanent above or below ground Watering hose limited and not very efficient .
Watering form a water truck limited access and use .
The selection of watering system is dependant on availability of suitable water and size of area to be treated .
If area is m then a drip or sprinkler system may be more efficient .
Regional advice should be sought on the most appropriate watering system for the project size and location . .
STEEP BATTER SLOPES Project Manager must ensure that the design of batters is suitable for the proposed revegetation measures .
Key locations for attention are steep batter slopes where subsoil rock and groundwater may cause instability of topsoil and vegetation .
Additional work in finishing of batters may be required to facilitate revegetationlandscaping works .
The risk of erosion is directly proportional to the length of time a disturbed soil area is exposed without vegetation cover or other surface protection .
Consideration shall be given to the need for batter protection and weed control during any interim period until the main revegetation work can be undertaken .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Revegetation Landscaping Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue The installation of temporary and or permanent control measures e.g .
erosion control matting hydro mulching may be required to control site surface runoff or wind erosion and minimise disturbance to areas of revegetation .
Steep and long slopes increase surface runoff and downslope transport of surface soil .
Surface roughening and benching of bare soil by creating furrows across slopes terracing or by surface roughing tracking the soil surface reduces erosion potential by decreasing runoff velocities trapping sediment and increasing infiltration of water into the soil and will facilitate effective mulching seeding and planting .
On accessible slopes mulch shall be anchored or tracked with suitable equipment to anchor the mulch into the soil .
On slopes that are inaccessible a suitable binding agent shall be applied in accordance with the manufacturers instructions to anchor the mulch .
If nominated for use as a binding agent bitumen emulsion shall be applied at a controlled rate nominal to litres per square metre of surface to match the soil moisture and site requirements .
If available brush rough cut site vegetation may be laid along the slope to provide a uniform cover thatch over the soil surface .
The brush shall be secured by mulch control netting wire strands running across the slope and secured to regular fixed stakes or equal method to prevent the brush from blowing away . .
PLANTING AND SEEDING It is important to allow leadtime for securing plants and any collection of seed or plant propagation .
At least one year is recommended before the required works are due to begin .
The propagation of plants and seed collection may be contracted out separately from the revegetation and landscaping works .
The pretreatment of seeds is necessary to improve germination and to assist to break dormancy .
The requirements for pretreatment should be nominated in Annexure B .
If not nominated the Contractor shall be required to treat all species of seed with pre treatment as per best horticultural practices .
In addition to smoke water hard seeded species shall be treated by scarification or hot water treatment .
A seeding rate should be specified within the design documentation .
In the absence of this information a default value of kgha can be used .
Hydromulch Unless specified otherwise in Annexure B the hydromulch shall consist of water cellulose fibre mulch tacifier e.g .
Gluon applied at ltr to ltr ha polygon a powder applied at kgha or equal and other materials paper mache or bulking agent as necessary to suit the size and location of the site area the slope and soil and local weather conditions .
Unless specified otherwise in Annexure B the hydromulch shall be applied at a nominal rate of litresha .
Rates can vary from up to litresha in response to project site conditions .
Soil conditions means that the application may involve several passes e.g .
on clay soils on sand batters .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Revegetation Landscaping Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue The critical measure is the depth applied .
The number of applications may vary due to the conditions. . WEED CONTROL Include any weed control requirements as part of Annexure B .
The control or removal of unwanted vegetation weed species is critical to ensure that planting and seeding operations are effective .
While eradication of all weed species may not be possible the objective is to control and reduce weed populations and to prevent their spread within the road reserve .
To make best use of available resources a listing of the weed species that pose the greatest risk should be identified and the weed control initiatives to target these priority species .
A weed control program must be developed for the contract area and implemented by the Contractor .
Nominated weed species should not be limited to the species identified in the design process .
The recommended approach is to require the Contractor to identify all weed species within the Contract area and to prepare a Weed Control Program and submit this to the Superintendent for approval prior to undertaking any works . .
PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES The term pesticide as defined by the Department of Health DoH includes herbicides fungicides and all other specific forms of pest control agents .
Herbicides are used to control or remove the growth of unwanted vegetation .
Also refer to the draft Main Roads environmental guideline on Water Protection .
Approval to apply pesticides on road verges in proclaimed areas must be obtained from the DoE .
In water catchment areas managed by the Water Corporation mixing or spraying of pesticide must not occur within m of other water courses where water is flowing .
within m of any visible natural or artificial pool or storage .
If rain is falling or is likely to occur within four hours following application .
When herbicides are to be used in water catchment areas the DoE or Water Corporation should be advised at least weeks before the spraying programme .
Details supplied should include location type of herbicide rate of application and date when work is planned .
Advice on appropriate herbicide use within the project area selective and or non selective residual timing etc .
should be sought from specialist in the area .
A weed control plan should be prepared for the project area .
Residual herbicides are generally not recommended for use within the road reserve .
A sample general list of herbicides that may be nominated for a specific project is provided below a Glyphosate Biactive at manufacturers recommended rate non selective .
b Lontrel for broadleaf weeds at manufacturers recommended rate .
c Verdict or Fusilade for narrow leaf grasses at manufacturers recommended rate .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Revegetation Landscaping Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue .
BLEND AREAS The zone between all proposed and existing landscaping treatments shall be blended both visually and functionally .
Blended areas are undertaken to Reinstate an existing landscaping damaged by the road works Extend the existing landscaping treatment into an adjoining area altered by the road works Modify an existing landscaping treatment to integrate with the proposed landscaping .
Where blend areas overlap private property the nominal extent is metres beyond the cadastral boundary or metres beyond the limit of any road works which have extended into the property .
This work shall only proceed with the approval of the landowner .
This work shall be undertaken at the contract rates submitted by the Contractor .

SAND FOR DRAINAGE LAYER .
Bassendean Sand is commonly used as a drainage layer in the Metro area with the grading limits following Table A. . Insert appropriate details of the specified drainage layer material. . PAVEMENT COMPACTION .
Where a range is given for the minimum characteristic dry density ratio in Table A the higher value in the range should be selected unless there is evidence that the Basecourse properties will be damaged by so doing e.g .
if a higher compactive effort causes breakdown of the stone and adversely affects the grading or the linear shrinkage of the Basecourse .
A higher compactive effort will reduce the risk of post construction wheel path rutting under traffic loading .
A more uniform Pavement Layer can be expected when a higher minimum characteristic dry density ratio is specified .
To achieve the higher density the Contractor will need to exercise greater control over the uniformity of the mixing and compaction processes e.g .
especially over the amount and uniformity of moisture in the Pavement Layer during compaction. . Cement stabilised or Lime Stabilised Basecourse must not be used under asphalt wearing courses unless approved by the Manager Materials Engineering . .
Refer to Engineering Road Note No .
for guidance to augment engineering judgement and knowledge of local materials . .

Annexure C Table C . BITUMINOUS SURFACING INTENT Clause .. has been inserted to define the intended outcomes of applying a bituminous surfacing treatment .
This specification includes a number of different types of treatment as indicated within Clause The critical intention will vary slightly from treatment to treatment .
The requirement for a bituminous treatment to be durable is constant irrespective of the type though the quantum will be different between a primerseal and a reseal for example .
The three bullet points in this clause are the essential outcomes of the application of a bituminous surfacing treatment .
If these outcomes are not met then the treatment is not achieving the desired intention and further scrutiny should be applied to determine the cause for this failure .
This might include such factors as design preparation application andor operational practices. . GEOTEXTILE REINFORCED SEALS Insert details for a Geotextile Seal in Table C. Refer to Austroads Report APT and Main Roads guideline for guidance on the use and design of geotextile seals . .

.. Where a doubledouble emulsion primerseal is used for a new pavement the typical treatment is First Coat mm crushed aggregate usually Perth granite BAR .
litresm² C Second Coat mm crushed aggregate usually Perth granite BAR .
litresm² C Specification Bituminous Surfacing Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .. Doubledouble emulsion seals using mm and mm sized aggregates should be applied using a emulsion CRS .
CRS bitumen content bitumen emulsion is far more liquid and less viscous than the emulsion and will flow on the road at emulsion application rates in excess of .
Lm .
This makes it problematic for spraying the first coat of a mm emulsion seal when binder run off will occur .
The emulsion allows an emulsion application rate of up to about .. Lm before run off may occur .
The direct application of CRS on to a basecourse without a prime is not recommended as the increased viscosity of the emulsion can impair the coating ability on the surface potentially leaving pinholes that facilitate moisture ingress into the basecourse. . RUBBER SEALS .. Where a rubberised seal is used as a Stress Alleviating Membrane SAM a Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer SAMI or for waterproofing membrane on a bridge deck it is specified in Specification POLYMER MODIFIED BITUMINOUS SURFACING .
.. rubber binder can be used in a GRS in lieu of Class bitumen where the GRS is subject to large numbers of heavy vehicles .
The use of rubber binder in a GRS is specified in this document. . ROLLING WITH STEEL WHEEL ROLLERS ..
There is no reference to the use of steel wheel rollers in the standard specification .
The use of steel rollers on sealreseal works is not recommended particularly on softer aggregates such as granite due to the possibility of overrolling and crushing the aggregate .
Steel wheel rollers travel slower than multi tyred rollers and delay the rolling process. . NOTES RE ANNEXURES .. ANNEXURE A SCHEDULE OF WORKS Use only if required e.g .

GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF WEARING COURSE ASPHALT .
Main Roads document number Guide for Surfacing Type Selection provides guidance on the use of various types of asphalt surfacings in different scenarios and speed zones. . mm DENSE GRADED LATERITE ASPHALT Refer Clause . . Laterite asphalt shall be used for bus lanes cycle lanes medians or road shoulders where delineation is required .
Laterite asphalt shall not be used for general traffic lanes. . mm OPEN GRADED ASPHALT .
For new construction or reconstruction works granite open graded asphalt shall be used for both the trafficked lanes and the break down lane or shoulder .
Red coloured granite open graded asphalt shall not be used for any application. . USE OF A MATERIAL TRANSFER VEHICLE .
The requirement to use a MTV has to be specified at Annexure C. MTVs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the MTV to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor .
Removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stopstart of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload .
The outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt .
MTVs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below .
Where a MTV must be used includes On a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt eg .
widening of Tonkin and Leach Highways near Perth Airport Gateway WA Project Where there are long paving runs eg Kwinana Fwy widening Roe to Armadale and Armadale to Russell Specification Asphalt Wearing Course Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name Where improved ride quality is required eg .
Great Eastern Hwy from Graham Farmer Fwy to Tonkin Hwy City East Alliance Where asphalt is to be placed in adverse weather conditions such as low temperatures or strong winds eg Winter paving When paving thin layers of asphalt containing a polymer modified binder .
MTVs may not be suited for the following scenarios On a project where there will be small daily production outputs of asphalt eg .
small minor improvement works Where there are confined spaces Small areas of widening such as intersection channelisation including short turn pockets. . MINOR WORKS CONTRACTS .
Where this document is used in a Minor Works contract with wearing course asphalt as the sole or primary work required Authors should ensure that the following specifications are also included in the tender documentation a.

This specification includes a number of different types of treatment as indicated within Clause The critical intention will vary slightly from treatment to treatment .
The requirement for a bituminous treatment to be durable is constant irrespective of the type .
Specification Polymer Modified Bituminous Surfacing Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name The three bullet points in this clause are the essential outcomes of the application of a bituminous surfacing treatment .
If these outcomes are not met then the treatment is not achieving the desired intention and further scrutiny should be applied to determine the cause for this failure .
This might include such factors as design preparation application andor operational practices . .
AGGREGATE .

Provide aggregate spread rates .
Based on test results where known calculated using the formula Spread rate m²m³ Average Least Dimension ALD adjusted to increase the amount of aggregate per m² for SAM and SAMI treatments by i.e .
Spread rate .ALD .
The provided rate should be adjusted in the field to give the correct stone mosaic .
Typical values are mm to m²m³ mm to m²m³ mm to m²m³ mm to m²m³ mm to m²m³ ..
Provide rate of deduction to allow for the cost of wastage in m³ for overspreading aggregate .
A typical value might be of the order of m³ and would represent the production cost of the aggregate . .
CONTRACTOR SUPPLIED AGGREGATE In Schedule L of the Conditions of Tender include an item to cover the Contractors response to clause .
resource of aggregate . .
AGGREGATE SIZE .. For bridge deck waterproofing membranes use mm aggregate with a SR binder or mm aggregate with a SE binder .
.. For a Stress Alleviating Membrane SAM seal the nominal aggregate size will typically vary between mm to mm .
.. For a Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer SAMI seal the nominal size of aggregate shall be mm .
Specification Polymer Modified Bituminous Surfacing Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .. For an enhanced aggregate retention seal the nominal size is that which would have been used for a seal using Class bitumen .
.. For a double double seal the stone size in the second coat is of the order of about half the size of the stone in the first coat where the larger sized stone is applied first .
Typical applications are mm which can be mm if mm aggregate supply is difficult however the control of spreading the mm stone has to be managed .
A mm double double seal is not recommended unless experienced Main Roads supervision is on site .
Larger combinations of mm mm or mm would be used as an extreme treatment to regain surface texture .
The mm sized aggregate is difficult to procure and a Contractor needs a good lead time to procure the stone .
An option is for a region to get its Materials Manager to liaise with quarries on availability .
The use of mm sized aggregate should not happen without discussion with the Materials Engineering Branch first as this is a very large sized stone that will result in a hungry surface texture which will be uncomfortable for some road users .
Neither mm or mm aggregate is to be used for single coat seals as the stones will become large missiles if dislodged by high speed traffic. . RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEAL DESIGN Amend Table C to show whether the Principal or Contractor is responsible for the design of sprayed seals. . ROLLING .
STEEL WHEELED ROLLERS There is no reference to the use of steel wheel rollers in the standard specification .
The use of steel rollers on sealreseal works is not recommended particularly on softer aggregates such as granite due to the possibility of overrolling and crushing the aggregate. . ROLLER SIZE Table .
requires that the size of rollers be specified by deleting one of two rows showing roller size .
For sprayed seals that will remain as so for their service life it is important to achieve the best embedment and alignment of the sealing aggregate at the time of application .
For seals or reseals with a service life to be beyond years heavier rollers with a minimum mass of tonnes must be used .
For seals that may not be trafficked such as SAMI seals under asphalt or bridge deck waterproofing membranes to be covered with asphalt smaller sized roller s of at least tonne mass are acceptable .
The use of the tonne rollers can be acceptable also for initial seals primerseals etc .
with a trafficked lifetime of no more than years. . NOTES RE ANNEXURES .

The Custodian of this specification is Bituminous Products Consultant. . USE OF A MATERIAL TRANSFER VEHICLE .
The requirement to use a MTV has to be specified at Annexure B. MTVs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the MTV to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor .
Removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stopstart of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload .
The outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt .
MTVs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below .
Where a MTV must be used includes On a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt eg .
widening of Tonkin and Leach Highways near Perth Airport Gateway WA Project Where there are long paving runs e.g .
Kwinana Fwy widening Roe to Armadale and Armadale to Russell Where improved ride quality is required e.g .
Great Eastern Hwy from Graham Farmer Fwy to Tonkin Hwy City East Alliance Where asphalt is to be placed in adverse weather conditions such as low temperatures or strong winds e.g .
Winter paving When paving thin layers of asphalt containing a polymer modified binder .
MTVs may not be suited for the following scenarios On a project where there will be small daily production outputs of asphalt e.g .
small minor improvement works Where there are confined spaces Small areas of widening such as intersection channelisation including short turn pockets .

SEAL ON ASPHALT INTERMEDIATE COURSE .
The aim of the seal is to waterproof the surface of the uppermost layer of the mm asphalt intermediate course .
Details of the binder aggregate type binder application rate and aggregate spread rate should be included in Specification or as appropriate .
The amount of binder applied will dictate how effective the seal will be at waterproofing the surface .
Single coat seals using mm and mm cover aggregate will have low binder application rates and will not provide sufficient waterproofing therefore the smallest size aggregate specified for a single coat seal is mm nominal size applied to SE modified binder at the following application rate Binder Application Rate C Lm Aggregate Spread Rate mm mm single coat seal using SE .
Where an emulsified binder is used it is not practical to apply the seal as a single coat of mm aggregate .
The specification requires that where an emulsion seal is to be applied over the mm intermediate course it has to be a mm two coat seal .

. . NOT USED TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF SIGNS .
TRANSPORTATION .
Traffic signs are intended to communicate information to the road user in a clear and concise manner . .
This can only be accomplished if the surface of the sign is free of damage abrasion dirt oil or other markings causing loss of legibility .
These problems are especially severe when dealing with reflective material since nighttime legibility is directly related to the quality and clarity of the reflective surface . .
This guide serves to highlight the important aspects of correct reflective sign storage and handling and is designed to be used by sign manufacturers sign users and erectors. . All finished signs should be handled transported and stored to prevent damage to the sign face or other components .
Signs should be stored vertically with their edges clear of the ground and in such a manner that the sign faces are not scuffed or marked making use of protruding stiffening members where possible. . Back to back storage of signs is permitted but pressure must not be transferred onto a sign face by any other sign or sign support .
Specification Signs Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .
When transporting signs by truck or trailer it is imperative that signs be securely braced vertically and adequately supported and secured to avoid damage due to scuffing abrasion and load shifting. . Large guide and information signs should be braced using wooden stiffeners attached to the extensions at the back of the sign and transported with the stiffeners in place to avoid buckling and rivet popping. . INDOOR STORAGE .
Signs should be preferably stored indoors .
Signs required to be stored outdoors must have the packaging removed and be stored so as to permit free air circulation and normal moisture evaporation .
Moisture must be prevented from remaining in contact with the face of the sign at all times .
Packaging that has become wet or damp must be removed immediately and the signs permitted to dry completely .
Steps need to be taken to ensure that high temperature and high humidity conditions do not occur in either indoor or outdoor storage . .
OUTDOOR STORAGE .
Signs stored outdoors shall be unwrapped from their transport packaging and stored upright on edge using wooden battens on the floor or as vertical supports or both. . Signs stored outdoors especially large guide or information signs should be stored using a racking system that will provide vertical support for the stored signs that will avoid pressure points on sign faces and allow adequate air circulation between sign faces to prevent a buildup of moisture. . SIGN COVERING .
Covering signs is not good general practice due to the damage that can be caused to the sign face through the interaction of environmental conditions . .
If it is necessary to cover a sign face temporarily after erection caution must be exercised as some coverings may cause permanent damage to the sign face following exposure to moisture and sunlight .
Some porous materials have been used successfully for limited periods by folding the material over the sign and securing it at the back of the sign .
At the same time the material needs to have sufficient opacity to prevent the reflective face of the sign showing through at night . .
Covering signs with paper or plastic materials especially black is forbidden as it is known that these materials are responsible for severe and permanent damage within hours as a consequence of the high temperatures and humidity conditions that can be generated during entrapment. . Avoid the use of ropes wire fasteners or strapping that may abrade the sign surface .
Do not apply tape to the sign race because sunlight will cause it to bond permanently .
Masking or application tape must be removed prior to exposure to sunlight . .
Some specially formulated low tack pressure sensitive films are available that are suitable to mask signs .
For specific details on use refer to technical literature available from the manufacturer of the retroreflective sheeting .
Specification Signs Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .
It is important that suitable materials are selected for covering signs in order not to jeopardise Sign Performance Warranties provided by the manufacturer of the retroreflective sheeting .

Primarily this means cleaning the surface of the reflective sheeting the essential characteristic of a sign .
Specification Signs Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .
A wet detergent type nonabrasive cleaner suitable for high quality paint surfaces is recommended .
The cleaner must also be free or strong aromatic solvents or alcohols and be chemically neutral i.e .
pH of around ..
Following use of any cleaning agent the sign surface must be thoroughly and immediately rinsed with clean water .
In all cleaning operations care should be taken not to abrade the sign by use of stiffbristle brushes or by unnecessary scrubbing .
.. NORMAL CLEANING PROCEDURE .
Flush the surface with clean water to remove loose dirt particles .
A squeeze or triggered hose nozzle is convenient for this purpose. . Wash the sign face with a rag or sponge using detergent or any of several suitable commercial cleaners .
Wash thoroughly from the top down .
Once suds have been applied keep a steady stream of water flowing on the sign face to wash away dirt particles. . Rinse the entire sign face with clean water and allow the sign to drain dry. . Take extreme care in cleaning screened sign faces since some cleaning solvents may damage the screen printed area .
Use a mild solvent such as mineral spirits .
Follow with detergent and water then rinse with clean water .
Do not use high pressure sprayers .
Do not direct sprays at sign face edges .

If there is any likelihood that rock will be encountered in installing the barrier this should be brought to the Contractors attention and if fill is being done as part of the Works then restrictions may need to be placed on the use of oversize material within the area that barrier system foundations may be placed .
Insert an appropriate clause in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS to cover the situation. . WBEAM AND THRIE BEAM BARRIERS CLAUSE . .

Appropriate Schedule of Rates Bill of Quantities items should be included to cover loading delivery and unloading of salvaged components to the Principals storage area .
Specification Safety and Traffic Barrier Systems Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .
When installing a road safety barrier system other than as part of a roadworks contract other clauses may be required to cover any clearing earthworks or other works required to install the barrier .
Suitable pay items should be included accordingly discuss with Main Roads Quantity Surveyor . .

ANNEXURE A ROAD SAFETY SYSTEM BARRIER REQUIREMENTS Where guide posts would normally be required and a wire rope barrier system is to be installed instead of installing guide posts either in front or behind the barrier an alternative is for the posts or post caps of the systems to be marked with Class A reflective tape as suitable for each system .
The location of the markings shall be in accordance with the Main Roads Guide to the Design of Guide Posts .
In this case the following text shall be added beneath the list of approved barrier systems .
Posts or post caps to be marked at suitable intervals based on post spacing to approximate m intervals .
For Brifen and Flexfence post caps shall be marked with mm wide x mm high Class A reflective tape .
For Sentryline II posts shall be marked with mm wide x mm high Class A reflective tape .
The location and colouring of the markings shall be in accordance with the Main Roads Guide to the Design of Guide Posts. . ANNEXURE B ROAD SAFETY SYSTEM BARRIER REQUIREMENTS .
The Designer must complete ANNEXURE B as appropriate for the particular project .
Table B .
Wire rope safety barriers systems WRSB come in a number of different post spacing .
The post spacing affects the amount of deflection where wire rope barrier is proposed .
The Designer shall nominate in Annexure B the deflection that has been allowed for in the design the test level and if the barrier is to be installed on a curve the radius of the curve and identify it as concave or convex and if installed on a vertical curve if K . Specification Safety and Traffic Barrier Systems Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name More guidance on the design of WRSB can be found in the Main Roads Guides to the Design of Road Safety Barriers .
Table B .
This is to be completed for barrier types other then WRSB e.g .
WBeam Thriebeam barriers for structures etc .
they are typically specified to be installed in accordance with Main Roads Standard Drawings and therefore the test level is irrelevant .
Likewise for the concrete barriers the test level is set by the height and foundation type of the concrete barriers if nominated on the Drawings as it should be the test level is therefore not relevant .
Barriers for structures are similarly treated .
Some of these details may be shown on the Drawings and therefore can be removed from Table B .. Table B .
End Treatments For the leading and departure end treatments for barrier systems other than wire rope either proprietary or public domain end systems can be used .
The only public domain systems that are currently approved for use by MRWA are the WAMELT refer to Drawings inclusive which is deemed to comply with TL and the trailing terminal refer to Figure F of AS NZS for limitations on the use of this .
The WA MELT has to be installed on a flare and uses timber breakaway posts .
There have been issues associated with the supply of the timber posts in terms of quality and availability and the costs for the terminal has matched or exceeded the proprietary systems which use steel breakaway posts .
Guidance on the use of the WA MELT was amended in July with the following statement being added The timber posts have associated supply and durability issues and the parabolic flare creates installation difficulties .
Designers are advised to utilise the other approved crashworthy terminals available .
If a proprietary end treatment is to be used then the Designer shall specify the Test Level and the type of end treatment i.e .
Redirective gating If an extruder type end treatment is required e.g .
SKT or ET Plus then this should be identified in the table and any requirements such as install on a flare should be shown on the Drawings or included in Table B. or Redirective nongating Wire rope systems have their own end treatments which are deemed to comply with TL .
For Wbeam barriers there are a number of acceptable end treatments that can be used .
The Designer may have chosen a particular product but in many cases other products may be acceptable .
To ensure that no supplier is disadvantaged designers shall nominate in Table B. the end treatment that has been used for the basis of the design and in Table B. the accepted Main Roads configuration as well as other acceptable alternatives .
Some of the proprietary end treatments have different configurations and not all of these are acceptable to Main Roads .
Details of approved systems and their configurations can be found in the end treatment design sheets at Appendix H of the Guide to the Design of Road Safety Barriers .
Specification Safety and Traffic Barrier Systems Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name Designers are to copy and paste the accepted configuration into Table B .. An example is given below .
Either contained in the table or preferably shown on the Drawings shall be details of how the end treatment shall be setout .
This is particularly relevant to the extruding gating end treatments which can be installed either on a flare or parallel to the road .
If the end treatment is public domain i.e .
WAMELT or the trailing terminal no test level is required and configuration details are required as the standard drawings have all the necessary information .

ANNEXURE C CONCRETE CLASS FOR CONCRETE BARRIERS The annexure contains default concrete strengths for concrete barriers .
In situations where road concrete barriers make up a small proportion of the total concrete barriers then to avoid having two classes on concrete on site the Designer may elect to change to concrete class on the road barriers to match the concrete barrier on the structure .
Annexure C would need to be changed accordingly .
If the Drawings indicate the class of concrete then the table in Annexure C can be deleted and the Annexure marked as Not Used .

REMOVAL OF EXISTING PAVEMENT MARKINGS Clause .
Where existing pavement markings are to be removed or covered the Contract shall specify the required method to be used .
Inapplicable methods should be deleted and marked NOT USED .
Notes .
In all instances where removal or cover of existing pavement markings is required permanent removal by overlay of the road pavement is the preferred option as it provides a new surface for the new markings without compromising safety .
Unless there is a concentration of pavement markings in one area i.e .
a marked pedestrian crossing it can be an expensive option however this must be assessed against the safety implications of an alternative method of removal .
Other methods of removal or cover are listed in ..
When choosing an alternative method of pavement marking removal or cover the following points should be considered a Is the removalcover temporary or permanent b Will the chosen method achieve the desired result in both the short and long term without excessive maintenance c Will the safety of road traffic be compromised i.e .
will the resultant surface still display old markings which could be misleading to traffic .
It should be noted that the painting over of existing road markings is considered to be a very short term and temporary measure . .
The Overspray method is generally used for aggregate seals only . .
SPOTTING OVERTAKING BARRIERS .
It is essential that prior to any longitudinal road marking taking place the road is spotted in accordance with the approved methodology as set out in Clause The marking of overtaking barriers must also be undertaken prior to any longitudinal road marking commencing .
It is essential that the overtaking barriers are marked out by a Main Roads accredited person .

p. Vision impaired This is a general term covering all vision difficulties that can not be adequately corrected by spectacles or contact lenses .
Blindness implies severe impairment including a total or near total loss of the ability to perceive form .
Therefore to cover total range of visual impairment it is referred as blind and vision impaired and when mentioned vision impaired it implies the person has sufficient residual vision for the user to benefit from the bold high contrast visual cues etc .

Warning indicators A warning indicator is a textured surface feature consisting of truncated domes built into or applied to walking surfaces to warn blind and vision impaired people of a nearby hazard .
r. Width The distance measured at right angles to the direction of travel .
. . NOT USED PRODUCT AND MATERIALS .
GENERAL .
TGSIs are designed to provide pedestrians with visual and sensory information .
The two types of TGSIs used by Main Roads WA are warning indicators and directional indicators . .
Warning indicators alert pedestrians to hazards in the continuous accessible path of travel indicating that they should stop to determine the nature of the hazard before proceeding further. . Directional indicators give directional orientation to blind and vision impaired people and designate the continuous accessible path of travel when other tactile or environmental cues are insufficient . .
The visual contrast between the walking surface and surrounding environment are critical for visionimpaired people who are using their limited residual vision for orientation distinguishing the limits of the footpath recognising hazards and gathering information .
Therefore contrast is especially important in the provision of TGSIs to warn users of hazards .
TGSIs shall provide a high visual contrast to the adjoining walking surface. . TGSIs shall be installed so that there is no likelihood of the edges lifting .
For this reason Main Roads WA does not approve the use of surface stick on type TGSIs unless additional mechanical fastenings eg .
screws are used. . Discrete TGSIs are not to be used on Main Roads WA projects unless there are contract specific requirements. . Main Roads WA does not recommend any specific TGSI for particular applications .
The Contractor will need to assess which type or style of TGSI is most suitable for the particular application taking into account substrate aesthetics contrast availability consistency with the surrounding area and cost. . An approved list of TGSI manufacturers and available colours that can be used based on luminous contrast for typical background materials in road infrastructure works is in Annexure A. Specification Tactile Ground Surface Indicators Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name .

METHOD OF INSTALLATION .
In the absence of any other documents approved by Main Roads Western Australia all components of a TGSI as well as the installation methodology shall conform to the manufacturers requirements . .
The methods of installation shall include a. Inbuilt into substrate Integrated TGSI tile b. Adhesive Fixing Integrated TGSI tile .
INBUILT INTO SUBSTRATE .
MRWAs preferred method of installation for integrated TGSI tiles is inbuilt into the substrate .
For new surfacing the TGSIs shall be inbuilt at the time of substrate construction in order to avoid the likelihood of the TGSIs coming off due to weak adhesionbonding between the substrate and tiles . .
Specific attention should be given to ensuring that the TGSIs are installed flush with the surrounding surface so as not create a trip hazard. . ADHESIVE FIXING .
To ensure satisfactory bonding of TGSIs to the surface it is a Main Roads WA requirement that this method of fixing be supplemented by mechanical means eg .
use of screws into the substrate. . TGSIs shall be installed with high strength adhesive recommended by the manufacturer on a smooth flat and dry surface to ensure the adhesive has maximum surface area contact. . For integrated TGSIs the edge of the base surface shall not be more than mm above the surrounding surface and have all exposed external edges chamfered . .
MECHANICAL FIXING .
In mechanical fixing TGSIs with a stem or spigot that protrudes into the substrate are used instead of TGSIs with a flat base .
This method is ideal to retrofit discrete TGSIs after the substrate has been laid or on an existing substrate .
The mechanical fixing mechanism may be supplemented through the use of an adhesive. . For mechanical fixing drilling templates shall be used as a guide and correct diameter holes drilled into the substrate to the minimum depth specified by the manufacturer. . Metal TGSIs must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable cleaning agent eg acetone prior to installation .
Any additional adhesive material used shall be recommended by the manufacturer .

Background Main Roads in the Perth metropolitan area operates a roadside help phone network that includes both cable connected PSTN and cellular GSM phones maintained by an electronic management system .
The specification for additions to the network requires management compatibility with the existing installed system .
The electronic maintenance and management system involves programming sets of key data into each phone facia by the supplier .
As data custodianship exists at separate locations it needs to be picked up and eventually dropped off with the supplier to use .
An electronic shuttle system ShuttleSked has been developed to pick up data at various stops and convey it ahead to various necessary destinations .
The shuttle itself essentially is an Excel spreadsheet titled Configuration Schedule .
Note Under the Contract Downer EDI Engineering and GHD Pty Ltd are service providers to Main Roads for electrical design and asset inventory custodianship and electrical infrastructure maintenance respectively including Metropolitan Roadside Help Phones . .
Shuttle Route CONTRACTOR collects a blank Configuration Schedule shuttle from its depot and completes the shuttle identification information of informs MRWA Maintenance contractor of the following information for each Help Phone a Contract No .
b Site Location Drawing No this can be shown as the first Drawing then add on c Name of Licensed Firm Installing Phones This licence will be checked by Main Roads at shuttlestop before authorisation to continue is given Separate shuttles are made up for separate phone suppliers if more than one is involved .
From information provided in Contract Documents the columns of Location Details are to be completed .
Note A If some Pillar Nos are to be provided with cableconnected PSTN phones rather than cellular phones in the OptusTelstra Details area the SIM PIN column in line with those Pillars should show PSTN to prevent inadvertent SIM card issue Note B If GSM phones are involved then SIM Cards issued by Optus will be sent by courier service to the phone supplier .
Hence the CONTRACTORS electronic note accompanying the Configuration Schedule shuttle must provide a delivery address .
Note C It is assumed that at this point the CONTRACTOR has already sourced a phone supplier and placed a formal order .
The suppliers name and email address must also be conveyed in the CONTRACTORS transmittal note .
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Roadside Help phones Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue When this data has boarded upon the Configuration Schedule it must be shuttled forward to the next stop along with a copy of relevant design location drawings .

MAIN ROADS Western Australia Specification Roadside Help phones Page of Contract xxxxx Document Issue ANNEXURE C C. COMMISSIONING OF PHONES The commissioning of the phones has to be done in stages .
It is important that each stage is completed prior to the next stage is commenced .
If certain stages are missed or completed in the wrong order it could result in phone being installed that do not work or have no location assigned so it is not known where the help call is coming from .
In the past a paper based ShuttleSked system was used but this became unworkable due to the changing roles of the parties involved in the installation process .
This process was abandoned and replaced with a process of stages that have to be completed in the correct order to ensure the phone becomes correctly operational .
C .. Commissioning Stages To ensure the phones are commissioned and become operational in a proper way the following stages have to be strictly adhered to .
Obtain SIM card and pillar number from MRWA . .
Inform MRWA CIC of details of each phone to be commissioned . .
Prior to the phones being installed check with the MRWA CIC that MRWA CIC Phone System is programmed . .
Install Help Phone in its intended location and make a test call to MRWA CIC . .
Inform MRWA TCIC Maintenance Contractor that a phone has been installed . .
Provide As Built and Handover documentation .
The MRWA Help Phones are normally installed by one party but up to parties work together to keep the system operational .
Therefore information has to be shared by all the parties in a controlled environment to ensure that the correct information is available at the right time to each party .
C Obtain SIM card and Pillar number from MRWA .

In any event the packing shall be replaced after driving each pile or more frequently if necessary. . To avoid the possibility of premature settingup pile driving shall be continuous in the latter stages without deliberate stops except as directed by the Superintendent .
Delays of as little as minutes may lead to significant setup in piles .
Where premature setup has occurred the Contractor shall be required to overcome this by continued driving where resistance to penetration may be significantly greater than normal . .
The Superintendent may direct that certain selected piles be subject to a setup test .
These piles shall be driven as specified and subsequently re driven hours after completion of initial driving .
A Provisional Sum is allowed for this operation . .
The Contractor shall record the number of blows for each mm of pile penetration .
Details of each pile driven shall be kept on pile driving record forms as shown in Annexure D. . DRIVING STEEL CIRCULAR PILES .
The Contractors attention is drawn to the special requirements for driving steel circular piles in particular the varied nature of the foundation material as indicated by the bore logs Drawings and the possible need to drive and excavate within and ahead of the steel circular piles to attain the specified penetration .
Where the bore logs show layers of hard rock it may be necessary to drill and blast before piles are driven to achieve the penetration .
Blasting shall be carried out in such a way that overbreak is kept to a minimum .
Driving Steel Circular Piles .
Blasting shall not be carried out inside steel circular piles .
Piles which can not be driven to the required penetration without exceeding a set of blowsmm using the hammer specified in Annexure A shall be excavated within the pile or ahead of the pile toe as necessary and redriven .
Repeated excavation and redriving may be necessary to achieve the minimum penetrations specified. . Excavation ahead of the pile toe shall be such as to keep overbreak to a minimum .
Where excessive overbreak occurs within .m from the minimum penetrations specified piles shall be extended to the required penetration by socketing as detailed on the Drawings. . Where the toe of a pile reaches sound rock at a level above the minimum penetration specified and where the bore information indicates that a minimum depth of m of sound rocks exists below the pile toe then the pile can be anchored into the rock by means of a rock socket as detailed on the Drawings .

In order to determine the dry film thickness of each coating the following procedure shall be adopted Specification Protective Treatment of Steelwork Issued Document No DXXXXXX Page of Contract No XXXXX Contract Name a .
Dry film thickness gauges shall be calibrated using shims of known thickness set on the blast reference sample .
The calibration procedure shall consist of taking not less than readings on the shim on the reference blast sample and from these determining the mean reading .
This mean reading shall be subtracted from the known shim thickness to produce a correction factor which shall be added algebraically to all subsequent readings of dry film paint thickness in order to obtain the true above peaks value .
i. Alternatively the gauge itself may be adjusted to yield the appropriate reading equivalent to the known shim thickness .
In this case not less than readings shall be taken until the gauge mean reading is equivalent to the known shim thickness .
ii .
This calibration shall be maintained throughout the duration of the contract except where blasting techniques or procedures are varied in which case the calibration procedure shall be repeated .
b .
Readings shall subsequently be taken of the total dry film thickness after the application of each type of coating .
c. At each stage the Contractor shall use the average reading for that surface .
d. The dry film thickness for any coating is the difference between the values obtained for this coating and the average total dry film thickness at the completion of the preceding coating .
e. Film thickness measurements will be taken at random to suit the shape of the area being tested and the number of such measurements shall be given as below i .
For large flat surfaces like the webs and flanges of beams the number shall be one per square metre .
ii .
For hand railing panels the number shall be six per linear metre .
iii .
For guard railings the number shall be four per linear metre .
iv .
For guardrail posts the number shall be four per post. . For assessing the compliance of a coating with the thickness requirement of this Specification all measured values of the dry film thickness on each surface shall equal or exceed the specified minimum dry film thickness for that coating .
Surfaces not meeting this requirement shall receive further coats of primer or finishing coat as appropriate to build up the paint thickness required .
