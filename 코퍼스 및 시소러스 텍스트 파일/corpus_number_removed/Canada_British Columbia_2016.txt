Guiding Principles for VEP Evaluation .. To be considered a VEP must be perceived by the Ministry to provide a tangible benefit to the Ministry such as a a reduction in the total cost of the Project or b an improvement to the product which the Ministry expects will reduce the life cycle costs or c a change in the Construction Schedule which will be beneficial to the Ministry or d a reduction or transfer of risk which will benefit the Ministry and should result in a product which is functionally equal or superior to that which would result in the absence of the VEP .
.. A VEP should not a impair the functionality and characteristics of the Project including but not limited to the service life economy of operation ease of maintenance aesthetic considerations preliminary engineering commitments or design and safety standards .
b be similar to a change in the Drawings or specifications under consideration by the Ministry for the Work at the time the VEP is submitted to the Ministry .
c increase the anticipated life cycle costs of the Project .
.. To be eligible for a Value Engineering Incentive a VEP must propose a change to the Work which meets the same constraints assumptions and considerations as those which governed the original design of the Work as it is defined in the Agreement .
Where Changed Conditions or other changes have occurred and have already created the need for a Change To Work a VEP which responds to this need will not normally be eligible for a Value Engineering Incentive and in any case will be eligible only for a reduced incentive .
.. A VEP may involve a a material or product substitution .
b a change to the Work method .
c a Work sequencing change including changes to traffic routing or detour sequences changes to structure or roadway construction sequences .
d a change to the design or engineering of the Project which provides a marked departure from the product as defined in the Contract Document Package. . Value Engineering Proposal Submissions ..

e an itemized cost analysis of the Net Cost Savings .
f the date which must be not less than two weeks after the date of the VEP by which the VEP must be implemented in order to maximize the cost reduction during the remainder of the Agreement .
.. Any request by the Contractor for substitution of material or method will only be considered if submitted as a VEP . .
Implementation of a VEP .. For those VEPs approved by the Ministry the Ministry Representative will prepare a Supplemental Agreement or a Work Order which will set out the Net Cost Savings the Change to Work required realizing the Net Cost Savings and the adjustment to the Contract Prices and payment terms resulting from the VEP in accordance with these guidelines .
..

MATERIALS .
Aggregate Classification ..
Crushed Surfacing Aggregates i High Fines Granular Surfacing Aggregate HFSA HFSA is used for surfacing of gravel roads .
Cohesion for this aggregate is achieved by plastic fines .
..
Crushed Base Course Aggregates These are high strength high load bearing high quality crushed granular base materials .
As these materially are not well suited for longterm traffic they are usually overlaid by surface course materials HFSA or asphaltconcrete pavement .
i WellGraded Base WGB WGB is the standard base course material used for pavement structures .
It is wellgraded with moderate permeability .
ii Intermediate Graded Base IGB IGB is intermediate in gradation and permeability between wellgraded aggregate and open graded aggregate .
iii Open Graded Base OGB OGB contains a small percentage of fine material and is highly permeable gap graded aggregate .
.. Subbase Aggregates A granular material placed between the subgrade and the base course aggregates providing strength and drainage to the pavement structure .
i Granular Subbase SGSB SGSB is the standard aggregate crushed or screened placed directly above subgrade with moderate permeability and a wide gradation .
ii Intermediate Graded Subbase IGSB IGSB is a higher permeability crushed subbase aggregate .
iii Open Graded Subbase OGSB OGSB is a highly permeable crushed subbase aggregate .
.. Bridge End Fill BEF BEF is quality granular fill placed behind and below a bridge abutment to provide good drainage a smooth transition from the bridge approaches to the bridge structure and a suitable material through which to drive piles. . General Description of Work The aggregates for granular surfacing base and subbase may be supplied either by the Contractor or produced from a Ministry provided source .
Production of granular surfacing and granular base requires crushing and placing in stockpile .
Production of select granular subbase may be by crushing screening or direct excavation .
Granular aggregate shall be loaded from the stockpile crushing and screening plant or pit face as may be applicable hauled out to the site placed accurately without segregation and thoroughly compacted to established line and grade .
The Contractor shall maintain the prepared surface of the base course aggregate until it has been paved or until completion of the contract whichever is applicable . .
Aggregate Quality .. General Granular aggregate shall be composed of inert clean tough durable particles of crushed rock gravel sand and fines capable of withstanding the deleterious effects of exposure to water freezethaw handling spreading and compacting and design traffic loading .
The aggregate particles shall be uniform in quality and free from clay lumps wood and free from an excess of flat or elongated pieces .
Aggregates for surfacing base subbase and bridge end fill will be tested in accordance with the tests listed in Table A .
.. Primary Quality Tests All aggregates for surfacing base subbase and bridge end fill shall meet the requirements of Table B .
Where the Ministry has preexisting test results the Ministry will make this information available to the Contractor and the Contractor will be able to rely on the factual data and not have to perform the corresponding primary quality tests on materials extracted from the investigated portions of the pit or quarry .
SECTION GRANULAR SURFACING BASE AND SUBBASES of BC MoT In circumstances where historic performance of material from a source has proven satisfactory the Ministry may by Special Provision waive any or all of the testing required in SS .. ..
Secondary Quality Tests All aggregates for surfacing base subbase and bridge end fill failing any primary quality test indicated in SS .. shall further be tested as follows to determine acceptability or at the Contractors option and at the Contractors expense a new source shall be found .
i If the Micro Deval test results show that the material fails then the soundness shall be reassessed by use of Magnesium Sulphate ASTM C . The material will be considered acceptable if the loss after cycles is less than for coarse aggregate the material retained on or above the .
mm sieve .
for fine aggregate the material passing the .
mm sieve ii If the aggregate fails any of the Sand Equivalent MicroDeval or Magnesium Sulphate tests then the Contractor shall perform the Ministrys petrographic test SS Appendix to determine the cause of failure .
The Ministry Representative may review the test results and determine whether the material is acceptable or not . .
Aggregate Gradation Gradation shall be determined in accordance with ASTM C Wash Test .
..
Aggregate shall have a gradation that defines a curve passing versus log sieve size with a slope between adjacent sieves equal or intermediate to the corresponding slopes of the boundary curves defined by the specification .

.. Shop Field and Maintenance Coating This consists of the series of operations that include the surface preparation pretreatment if required and application of coatings to structural steel surfaces either in the shop or in field .
It also includes the supplying of all labour equipment and materials .
In addition it encompasses the protection of newly coated surfaces during curing transport and erection as well as the protection of traffic property and the environment .
Additionally it also includes the disposal of waste material in accordance with all applicable environmental fisheries and local regulations and bylaws .
.. Painting Coating The terms painting and coating are considered synonymous for the purposes of this document .
Techniques such as metallizing or galvanizing while not typically thought of as painting are considered here to be painting or coating since they form part or all of a protective system .
.. Shop Coating Shop coating is the coating of steel or other components in a shop or plant before shipment to the site of erection .
This may include part of a coating system or the whole system including the topcoat .
.. Field Coating Field coating is the coating of steel or components at the place of erection .
..
Maintenance Coating Maintenance coating is the coating of structures in service that have previously been partially or completely coated .
The maintenance coating may be one of four general types Touchup Touchup is the cleaning and coating of small selected areas on a structure .
Typically this is used to repair damaged or failed areas of coating .
For repairs sufficient coats are added to bring the new coating up to the level of the existing coating surrounding the repairs .
It may also be used as an interim maintenance strategy to extend the lifetime of a coating system overall .
Coat Zone coating is the coating process where specific whole parts of a structure are coated and others are deliberately left .
This deals with larger portions of a structure than touchup coating .
For example an above deck arch portion of a bridge would be zone coated but the edges of the flanges would be touched up .
Zone coating may use touchup overcoat or recoat strategies to meet its objectives .
Zone coating also includes coating new steel added to old structures for example steel added for seismic upgrades .
Overcoating Overcoating is the coating of portions of a structure where the structure is touched up then coated with a topcoat overall .
It may include top coating part or all of the structure .
Recoating Recoating is the coating process where larger portions of old coating on a structure are removed to bare metal and a completely new coating system is applied over the entire area .
.. Anchor Profile The anchor profile is a measure of the roughness of the prepared surface .
The profile is normally measured from surface peak to surface valley and expressed as a range for example to ยตm or to mils .
Besides the depth the surface profile is dependant on the grit type used to create it .
Mineral abrasives such as sand slag garnet etc .
produce a sharp profile .
Steel shot produces a rounded profile unless mixed with steel grit .
Normally the anchor profile is specified for both depth and sharpness .
..
Containment Hoarding The process of encapsulating the work site so that hazardous or nuisance materials can not escape to the surrounding environment .
SSPC Guide Guide for Containing Debris Generated During Paint Removal Operations specifies types and levels of containment necessary for various cleaning operations .
.. Ambient Conditions Ambient conditions refer to such things as wind relative humidity dew point air temperature substrate temperature etc .
that affect the cleaning application and curing of coatings .
They are very important in obtaining a properly adhered long life coating .
All coating works shall be within the specified parameters as given in SS .. SS .. and SS Where ambient environmental conditions do not fall within these conditions coating work may continue if the conditions are being met within the containment .
This may mean extra hoarding dehumidification ventilation andor temperature control for the duration of cleaning application and curing of the coating system .

Preliminary and General The work covered by this section covers the use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement RAP material in hot mix asphalt construction .
This specification allows for the use of both Classified and Unclassified RAP .
The contractors development and processing of RAP into an end paving product must meet SS Asphalt Pavement Construction EPS for Highway Construction .
The maximum allowable percentage of RAP allowed in asphalt pavement will be based on the classification of the roadway and the location of the mix in the pavement structure or as identified in the Special Provisions. . Roadway Categories Roadways are divided into the following categories Category A All numbered Highways .
Category B Other Roads .
The roadway Category shall be identified in the Special Provisions. . Definitions Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement RAP Removed andor reprocessed pavement materials containing asphalt and aggregates .
These materials are generated when asphalt pavements are removed for reconstruction andor resurfacing .
When properly screened and crushed it consists of high quality aggregate coated by asphalt cement .
Classified RAP RAP obtained from Ministry roadways will be termed as Classified RAP .
Unclassified RAP RAP obtained from nonMinistry sources or mixed with RAP from other sources .
Rheology is the study of deformation and flow of matter .
For asphalt binder rheology it refers to the flow characteristics of the asphalt binder in the asphalt mix .
Deformation and flow of the asphalt binder in asphalt mix is important in determining asphalt pavement performance. . Allowable RAP Addition Rates The maximum RAP allowed in the asphalt mix shall be determined by the contribution of the RAP Asphalt Cement AC towards the total AC content in the mix by weight as per the percentages specified in Table A .
The Contractor shall notify the Ministry Representative days in advance of Paving if RAP will be used in the project and shall fill all fields as applicable and sign this Appendix II RAP RECORD SHEET and submit it to the Ministry Representative days in advance unless the project Special Provisions state differently .
Table A Maximum Percent RAP AC Replacement allowed in Asphalt Mix Road Classification Top Lift Lower Lifts Category A Category B The amount of total AC replaced by AC in the RAP will be calculated as follows AC Replacement a x b c Where a AC content of RAP b RAP percent in mixture by total weight of mix c Total Percent AC content in mixture Inclusion of RAP into the hot mix asphalt will be as per the maximum allowable percentage of AC replacement unless otherwise noted in the Special Provisions. . Materials .. RAP The Contractor shall fulfill or exceed the requirements of SS Appendix RAP Management Best Practices for the management of RAP materials from the time of collection through processing mix design and quality control practices during the production of asphalt mixtures containing RAP and the Contractor SECTION USE OF RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION of BC MoT shall provide documentation to the Ministry Representative that best practices have been followed in the handling classification and storage of RAP material prior to being allowed to use the RAP .
.. Asphalt Cement When the Percent RAP AC Replacement amount is greater than the blended AC must meet the penetration and viscosity requirements of the specified asphalt cement specified in the Special Provisions when penetration graded asphalt cement is specified or the temperature requirements of the specified Performance Graded Asphalt Cement PGAC when a PGAC is specified or substituted for penetration graded asphalt cement .
.. Use of Rejuvenators Usage of Softening agents rejuvenators or recycling agents will not be permitted .
.. Use of Recycled Asphalt Shingles Usage of Recycled asphalt shingles will not be permitted. . RAP Sampling Sampling of the RAP shall be as per SS Appendix RAP Management Best Practices. . Quality Control The quality control testing requirements for RAP shall be based on the percent of AC replacement in the asphalt mix as per the requirements listed in Table B and the Minimum test frequency guidelines for Quality Control listed in Table C in Appendix I .. RAP Aggregate Testing a Basic Tests The following basic properties shall be determined for the proposed RAP Moisture Content Asphalt Content Gradation Percent Fracture and Specific Gravity of coarse and fine fractions for mix design purposes .
Individual representative RAP samples shall be tested to determine moisture content gradation percent fracture and asphalt content .
Tests to determine the specific gravity of the coarse and fine fractions of RAP shall be completed on the combined aggregates obtained by combining the individual reclaimed aggregates retained after the extraction of the asphalt cement .
b Consensus Tests The tests for the consensus properties shall be completed on the combined aggregates virgin aggregates and reclaimed aggregates mixed in the proportions proposed for the mix design .
The following aggregate consensus properties shall be determined for the combined aggregate samples Maximum Micro Deval Abrasion loss factor Standard Test Methods for uncompacted void content of fine aggregate as influenced by particle shape surface texture and grading ASTM C and Percentage of flat and elongated particles for Superpave mixes only .
.. AC Rheology Testing When AC rheology testing and design is required the blended AC must meet the penetration and viscosity requirements of the specified AC type .
For penetration graded asphalt rheology is measured in terms of penetration at oC and viscosity at oC .
For performance grade asphalt cements PGAC rheology is tested as per the procedures outlined in AASHTO MP and reported in terms of high and low temperature service ratings i.e .
PG .
Since the rheological properties of asphalt binder vary with temperature rheological characterization involves two key considerations To compare different asphalt binders their rheological properties must be measured at some common reference temperature .
To fully characterize an asphalt binder its rheological properties must be examined over the range of temperatures that it may encounter during its life .
For mixes specified to use PGAC the blended AC must meet the temperature requirements of the specified PGAC .
For asphalt mixtures containing RAP and specified to use Performance Graded PG asphalts the RAP rheology and the grade of virgin asphalt to be used shall be determined according to Appendix X of AASHTO MP .

Classified RAP AC Replacement Required Tests Basic Tests Basic Tests Consensus Tests AC Rheology Testing Unclassified RAP Basic Tests Consensus Tests Basic Tests Consensus Tests AC Rheology Testing SECTION USE OF RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION of BC MoT SS APPENDIX RAP MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES A best practice in the context of this Standard Specification is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means and that is used as a benchmark .
A best practice may evolve to become better as improvements are discovered .
Best practice is considered to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that are commonly achieved in the industry .
RAP Sources RAP may be obtained from several sources .
The common sources of RAP are Cold Milling This is the most common source of RAP .
The milling process should be closely examined to make sure that the milled material is not contaminated with soil base materials paving geotextiles or other foreign material sulphur asbestos rubber etc ..
The milled material that becomes contaminated should be stockpiled separately from RAP to be used in asphalt mix .
A special milling operation may also be beneficial when it is desirable to mill the surface layer in one pass and the underlying layers in a second pass because the surface course millings may contain aggregates with higher fractured aggregates that could be incorporated in the new surface layers .
Full Depth Pavement Removal RAP can also be obtained from the removal of the existing pavement using a bulldozer or a backhoe .
This process typically results in large chunks of pavement that may be contaminated with underlying soils .
This contaminated material should be stored in a separate stockpile and not to be used in the hot mix asphalt .
Asphalt Plant Waste This includes the waste generated during plant startup transition between mixes plant clean out mix rejected from projects and excess mix produced that could not be placed .
This material usually has fewer fines than the typical RAP since it wasnt milled or broken up during pavement removal and the AC is less aged than RAP since it hasnt been subjected to environmental aging .
This material should be stockpiled and tested separately from the other RAP .
RAP Contamination Best practice for RAP stockpiles is to keep them free from contaminants .
RAP stockpiles should be treated as a valuable material .
Truck drivers bringing the material on the site should ensure that unwanted debris or contaminated material does not end up in the RAP stockpile .
The plant QC personnel and the loader operators should continuously monitor processed and unprocessed RAP stockpiles to make sure that they do not contain deleterious materials .
If any contaminants are found they should be removed immediately so that they are not covered up with other RAP brought on to the yard .
RAP Categories RAP obtained from MoT sources is referred to as Classified RAP .
RAP obtained from non MoT sources or mixed with RAP from other projects is referred to as Unclassified RAP .
RAP Processing Best practice for RAP processing involves one or more steps to create consistent materials .
Screening is used to separate sizes .
In some cases it may be desirable to screen or fractionate RAP to coarse and fine fractions .
RAP separation based on sizes increases quality and reduces variability in the RAP properties .
For stockpiles of RAP from multiple sources particularly stockpiles containing oversize fragments of RAP or pavement slabs the material should be processed to produce RAP with a maximum size of .
mm for use in hot mix asphalt .
Further processing of RAP may include both screening and crushing to produce a uniform gradation AC content and other properties .
Since crushing RAP will create more aggregate fines it is best to set up the crushing operation so that the RAP is screened before it enters the crusher .
RAP processing shall occur as early as possible in the construction planning process .
RAP Stockpiling The best practice to minimize the accumulation of moisture in stockpiles is to cover the stockpile with a shelter tarp or building to prevent precipitation from getting to the RAP .
RAP stockpiles should be placed on a base with adequate drainage and constructed with minimal segregation .
Arcshaped conical uniform stockpiles are preferred for storing processed or unprocessed SECTION USE OF RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION APPENDIX RAP MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES BC MoT of RAP .
No contamination of the RAP from the stockpile base materials should occur .
Use of heavy equipment on top of the RAP stockpile should be minimized to avoid compaction of the RAP .
It is also recommended that the RAP stockpiles be limited to m in height to reduce the potential for self consolidation of the stockpile .
RAP Sampling Best practice is for representative RAP samples to be collected from the stockpile prepared for the project .
At least one sample per tonnes of RAP in the stockpile or a minimum of ten samples per stockpile should be taken and retained for testing .
If the asphalt mix from an existing pavement is to be used as RAP mm diameter cores should be extracted at a frequency of at least one core every .
kilometer in each lane prior to the start of the project .
The asphalt mix from the pavement lift to be recycled should be tested to determine the properties of the aggregates and the asphalt cement in the pavement .
Sampling Method Best practice for sampling aggregates applies to the sampling of RAP as well .
RAP stockpiles should be sampled as they are being built at the location where they will be fed into the asphalt plant .
Sampling at the time the stockpile is built is the best practice and will be easier and more representative of the stockpile compared to samples taken later after the formation of the crust on the face of the RAP stockpile .
Proper sampling procedures normally used for virgin aggregates should also be used to sample RAP aggregates as included in AASHTO T Sampling of Aggregates Standard Specifications for Transportation Materials and Methods of Sampling and Testing th Edition .
Minimum Test Frequencies The quality control tests on the RAP and the extracted aggregates should be completed at the minimum frequencies specified in Table C Guidelines for Minimum Quality Control Test Frequencies .
All RAP aggregates retained after extraction should be combined together into one sample .
The combined sample should then be sieved and split into coarse and fine fractions and used to determine the specific gravity of the recycled aggregates .
Stockpile Management When a stockpile reaches the desired quantity and has been sampled and characterized no additional RAP material should be added to it .
Subsequent RAP material should be stockpiled in a separate stockpile and characterized in the same manner .
This process should continue such that characterized stockpiles are not compromised by new RAP materials .
Samples from the RAP stockpile should be taken and the testing completed as per the minimum test frequencies specified in Table C. Table C Guidelines for Minimum Quality Control Test Frequencies Test Minimum Frequency Asphalt Content One per tonnes Gradation One per tonnes Percent Fracture One per tonnes Specific Gravity of coarse fraction of RAP Minimum of One per tonnes or three per stockpile Specific Gravity of fine fraction of RAP Minimum of One per tonnes or three per stockpile Maximum Micro Deval Abrasion loss factor Minimum of One per tonnes or three per stockpile Fine aggregate angularity Minimum of One per tonnes or three per stockpile Flat and elongated particles For Superpave Only Minimum of One per tonnes or three per stockpile AC Rheology Minimum of One per tonnes of RAP or a minimum of three tests per project .

Flushing and Bleeding Flushing and bleeding is the emergence of excess asphalt and fines onto the finished surface and the significant loss of coarse surface texture leaving little or no effective cover aggregate visible .
.. Pock Marks Pock Marks are indentations in the mat texture normally less than the thickness of the graded seal layer evidenced by the absence of effective cover aggregate in a small area No photograph available .
.. Pot Holes Pot Holes are the loss of all cover aggregate and base materials into the underlying asphalt or gravel base .
Pot Holes may develop because of seal andor base weakness .
.. Raveling Raveling is a general term for loss of cover aggregate which can include numerous pock marks .
.. Streaking Streaking is a continuous visible absence of effective cover aggregate often seen paralleling a ridge of excess cover aggregate characterized by the narrowness of its width and the significant extent of its length .
Where streaking displays an absence of effective cover aggregate the condition is unlike raveling in that there was originally little or no effective aggregate in the area .
