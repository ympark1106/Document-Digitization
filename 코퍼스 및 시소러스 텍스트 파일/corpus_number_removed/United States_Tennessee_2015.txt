Regardless the Engineer may at any time require the use of a string line reference system .
even if previously waived if in the Engineers opinion the use of the string line will result in a superior riding surface .
When the string line system is required on a multicourse pavement use it on at least two courses exclusive of the surface course .
When using the ski type system the ski shall have the maximum practical length and in no case shall it be less than feet in length .
Pavement lanes previously placed with automatic controls or to form grade may serve as the longitudinal control reference for placing adjacent lanes by using a ski or joint matching shoe .

On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impracticable take the mixture from the hopper of the spreading machine and distribute it immediately into place using suitable shovels and other tools and spread the mixture with rakes and lutes in a uniformly loose layer of such depth as will result in a completed course having the required thickness .
The Contractor and the Department will each be required to have an individual onsite that is certified by the Department through the HMA Roadway Certification Course .
. . Compaction A .
General After spreading and strikingoff the bituminous mixture and adjusting surface irregularities thoroughly compact the mixture using methods approved by the Engineer and that are capable of achieving the specified density while the material is in a workable condition .
When no density requirements are specified use a system of compaction for roadway pavements that has previously produced the required bituminous pavement densities .
The Engineer may require a control strip and random density samples to evaluate the system .

Except as noted below each paving train shall consist of a minimum of three rollers meeting ..
The intermediate roller in each train shall be a pneumatic type .
If the surface course contains a latex or polymer additive the Contractor may use a steel wheel type roller for intermediate rolling instead of a pneumatic type provided the surface course meets density requirements . .
Provide a minimum of two rollers when placing CS TL or TLD mixtures .
Perform breakdown rolling as soon as possible and while the mixture is sufficiently hot using a pneumatic tire roller having a minimum contact pressure of pounds per square inch .
Do not substitute a combination roller for a pneumatic roller when placing CS mix .
Regulate the paver speed so rollers can maintain proper compaction of the mixture as determined by the Engineer. . With the Engineers approval the Contractor may reduce the minimum number of rollers listed above to one roller of either the steelwheel or vibratory type on the following types of construction and projects a .
Shoulder construction .
b. Incidental construction such as bridge approaches and driveways and c. Projects containing less than square yards of bituminous pavement. . Compaction of OGFC mixtures shall consist of a minimum of two passes with a steel double drum asphalt roller with minimum weight of tons before the material temperature has fallen below F. Provide a minimum of two roller units so as to accomplish the compaction promptly following the placement of the material .
At no time shall a pneumatic tire roller be used or a steel wheel roller be used in vibratory mode .
If the roller begins to break the aggregate immediately stop rolling .
Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer begin rolling at the low side and proceed longitudinally parallel to the road centerline .
When paving in echelon or abutting a previously placed lane roll the longitudinal joint first followed by the regular rolling procedure .
When paving in echelon rollers shall not compact within inches of an edge where an adjacent lane is to be placed .
Operate rollers at a slow uniform speed with the drive wheels nearer the paver and keep the rollers as nearly as possible in continuous operation .
Continue rolling until all roller marks are eliminated .
Do not park rollers on the bituminous pavement .
To prevent adhesion of the mixture to the rollers keep the wheels properly moistened with water or water mixed with very small quantities of detergent or other approved material .
Limit excess use of liquid .
Do not refuel rollers on bituminous pavements .
Along forms curbs headers walls and other places not accessible to the rollers compact the mixture thoroughly using hot hand tampers smoothing irons or with mechanical tampers .
On depressed areas the Contractor may use a trench roller to compact the mix .

Variable width sections make the use of finishing machines impracticable .
When the Engineer allows hand finishing strikeoff and screed the concrete as soon as it is placed .
Use a screed that is at least feet longer than the maximum width of the slab to be struck off of approved design and sufficiently rigid to retain its shape .
When reinforcement is used in the pavement provide a strikeoff template for striking off the bottom layer of concrete .
Consolidate the concrete using a suitable vibrator and other approved equipment .
Repeat screeding until the surface is of uniform appearance true to grade and crosssection and free from porous areas .

Adjust the forward speed so that the float will lap the distance directed by the Engineer on each transverse trip .
Pass the float .
over each area of pavement at least two times while preventing excessive operation over a given area .
Waste excess water or soupy material over the side forms on each pass .
After floating remove excess water and laitance from the surface of the pavement with a straightedge feet or more in length .

If the Engineer determines superficial water is needed to assist in finishing apply such water by lightly fogging .
G. Surface Texturing Texture the surface using a burlap drag consisting of a seamless strip of damp burlap which when dragged longitudinally along the full width of pavement produces a uniform surface of gritty texture .
Maintain the drag in such condition that the resultant surface is of uniform appearance and reasonably free from grooves over inch in depth .
After finishing the pavement by the burlap drag texture the surface by forming transverse grooves .
Form the transverse grooves with mechanical equipment using a comb made of steel tines vibrating beam roller or other approved device .
The Contractor may use manual tools such as rakes with spring steel tines on areas inaccessible to .
mechanical equipment or areas of square yards or less and variable width .
Form the grooves in the concrete at an appropriate time while the concrete is still in a plastic state so that in the hardened concrete the grooves will be between .
and .
inches in width and between .
and .
inches in depth .
Space the grooves at random intervals between .
and .
inches .
Regardless of the method used to form the grooves ensure that the grooves are relatively smooth and uniform and are formed without excessive tearing of the surface and without bringing pieces of the coarse aggregate to the top of the surface .
If the equipment breaks down or experiences mechanical failure the Contractor may use manual tools for grooving provided all mixing and placing operations cease until proper repairs are made .
Correct at no expense to the Department all individual areas of square yards or larger of the hardened grooved concrete that do not conform to these requirements by cutting acceptable grooves in the hardened surface with an approved cutting machine or by other approved methods .
H. Edging at Forms and Joints After the final finish but while the concrete is still in a plastic state round the outside edges of the pavement to a inch radius .
When pavement is formed along a lane line round the edges to a inch radius .
Round the edges of the pavement on each side of transverse expansion joints formed joints and transverse construction joints to a inch radius .
Perform edging with an approved edging tool that will produce a welldefined and continuous radius .
Eliminate all tool marks formed by the edging tool by brushing to form a texture similar to the burlap drag finish . .

The shop inspection performed by the inspection agency hired by the Department is intended as QA to assure to the Department that the fabricator is following all quality control requirements and is providing a product conforming to the Contract requirements .
The inspection agency is not instructed or expected to replace the fabricators quality control .
The inspection and acceptance of the work performed by the Departments inspection agency does not relieve the fabricator of providing materials and finished products as specified .
The Department may reject defective or nonconforming materials at any time .
Replace rejected materials promptly at no additional cost to the Department .
Include the cost of nondestructive testing in the lump sum bid price for steel structures. . General A .
Type of Construction The type of construction shall be welded or bolted as shown on the Plans. . B. Workmanship and Finish Workmanship and finish shall be in accordance with the American Institute of Steel Construction AISC best general practices in modern bridge shops .
Provide a neat finish to portions of the work exposed to view .
C. Storage of Materials Store material either plain or fabricated above the ground on platforms skids or other supports .
Keep materials free from dirt grease or other foreign matter and provide appropriate protection from corrosion .
D. Straightening Material Ensure that rolled material before being laid off or worked is straight .
If straightening is necessary use methods that will not damage the metal .
Only perform heat straightening of ASTM A Grade W ASTM A or ASTM A steel under rigidly controlled procedures with each application subject to the Engineers approval .
Do not allow the maximum temperature of the steel to exceed F as set forth in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Highway Bridge Fabrication with High Performance Steel current edition and the AASHTO Bridge Welding Code current edition .
The Engineer will reject material with sharp kinks and bends .
To straighten plates angles other shapes and builtup members when permitted by the Engineer use methods that will not fracture or otherwise damage the metal .
Straighten distorted members by mechanical means or if approved by the Engineer by carefully planned procedures and supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat .
However to heat straighten AASHTO M ASTM A Grades HPSW and W steel members adhere to the AASHTO Guide Specification for Highway Bridge Fabrication with High Performance Steel current edition and the AASHTO Bridge Welding Code current edition with each application subject to the Engineers approval .
Do not exceed the maximum temperatures specified in Table .. . Table .
Heat Straightening Grade Maximum Temperature degrees F Grade HPSW inches from weld F Grade HPSW inches from weld F Grade W inches from weld F Grade W inches from weld F In all other steels do not allow the temperature of the heated area to exceed F as controlled by temperature indicating crayons liquids or either contact or noncontact infrared thermometers .
Heating in excess of the limits shown will be cause for rejection unless the Engineer allows testing to verify material integrity .
Keep parts to be heat straightened substantially free of stress and from external forces except stresses resulting from mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat .
The Engineer will reject pieces showing evidence of fracture following straightening of a bend or buckle .
E. Heat Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders .
Materials .
Do not perform heatcurving in steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum yield point greater than pounds per square inch . .
Type of Heating .
Curve beams and girders by either continuous or Vtype heating as approved by the Engineer. . a .
Continuous Method .
For the continuous method heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flanges simultaneously .
Ensure that the strip is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
b. Vtype Heating .
For Vtype heating heat the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate and in regularly spaced truncated triangular or wedgeshaped areas having their base along the flange edge .
Determine the spacing and temperature of areas necessary to obtain the required curvature .
On the inside flange surface terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area just before the juncture of the web and the flange .
To avoid web distortion take special care when heating the inside flange surfaces the surfaces that intersect the web so that heat is not applied directly to the web .
When the radius of curvature is feet or more extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than feet extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to of the flange or inches whichever is less .
The truncated triangular pattern shall have an included angle of approximately to degrees and a base of no greater than inches .
The Engineer may approve variations in these patterns .
For both types of heating the flange edges to be heated are those that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .
Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is only required when the flange thickness is inches or greater in which case heat the two surfaces concurrently . .
Temperature .
Conduct the heatcurving operation so that the temperature of the steel does not exceed F for Grades W and HPSW and F for Grades HPSW and W as measured by temperatureindicating crayons or other suitable means .
Do not artificially cool the girder until after it has naturally cooled to F the method of artificial cooling is subject to the Engineers approval . .
Position for Heating .
The girder may be heatcurved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position . .
When curving girders with the web in the vertical position brace or support the girder to prevent it from overturning .
When curving with the web in the horizontal position support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points if required to obtain uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder and externally applied loads to exceed the usual allowable design stress .
During heating maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within inches of the flanges to avoid a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling. . Sequence of Operations .
Heatcurve the girder before painting and either before or after completing all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners .
However unless provisions are made for girder shrinkage locate and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required heatcurve or oxygencut them separately and then weld them to the curved girder .
When attaching cover plates to rolled beams attach them before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than inches and the radius of curvature is greater than feet .
For other rolled beams with cover plates heatcurve the beams before attaching the cover plates .
Either heatcurve or oxygencut cover plates separately and then weld them to the curved beam. . Camber .
Camber girders before heat curving .
Camber rolled beams by heatcambering methods approved by the Engineer .
For plate girders cut the web to the prescribed camber with suitable allowance for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat curving .
If necessary correct moderate deviations from specified camber by a carefully supervised application of heat as approved by the Engineer . .
Measurement of Curvature and Camber .
The Engineer will measure horizontal curvature and vertical camber for final acceptance after all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
The Engineer will check horizontal curvature with the girder in the vertical position .

. . Further tighten the bolt to the smallest gap to be allowed in the work .
Normally this smallest gap is defined as the gap at all the spaces less than .
inch and not all gaps completely closed .
Ensure that the .inch gage is refused at all spaces but a visible gap exists in at least one space .
The bolts in this test and in the actual installation should not be installed to a no visible gap condition .

Failure of the bolt due to overtightening may occur if the bolt is tightened beyond complete crushing of the DTI . .
Remove the bolt from the calibrator and turn the nut on the threads of the bolt by hand .
The nut should be able to be turned on the complete length of the threads excluding the thread runout .
If the nut is unable to go the full thread length the load required for the minimum gap in Step is too large .
The test must be repeated with a larger minimum gap for example one space that will accept a .inch feeler gage to establish the smallest gap allowed in the work for the fastener rotationalcapacity lot allowed in the work. . Bolts from rotationalcapacity lots that are too short to fit in the tension measuring device shall be tested by tightening to the minimum gap in Step and checked in accordance with Step .

After a shell or pipe has been filled with concrete do not drive a shell pipe or pile within feet of it until at least days have elapsed. . Test Piles When called for in the Bid Schedule furnish and drive test piles of the dimensions at the locations and to the minimum tip elevations shown on the Plans or as designated by the Engineer .
When approved by the Engineer the Contractor may drive test piles to be load tested through the existing overburden without excavating to the bottom of the footing elevation and by predrilling when required by the Engineer provided that the additional length of test pile necessary to obtain the requirements specified below is furnished at no additional cost to the Department .
Before driving any other test or foundation piles excavate the ground at each test pile to the elevation of the bottom of the footing .
Drive test piles to be load tested full length or to the specified bearing indicated on the Plans as determined by the applicable specification equation in .
whichever occurs first .
Drive all other test piles full length or to .
times the specified bearing indicated on the Plans whichever occurs first .
However the tip elevation for all piles shall be either a minimum of feet below ground elevation or the minimum tip elevation when specified on the Plans .
If the test pile has been driven to .
times the specified bearing but has not reached the minimum tip elevation continue to drive the test pile until the required penetration is obtained or practical refusal occurs whichever occurs first .
When the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding .
practical pile refusal use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .
Practical refusal shall be defined as blows per inch for consecutive inches of driving or when times the minimum required bearing is achieved based on the last inches of driving .
Use pile driving equipment capable of driving to .
times the specified bearings indicated on the Plans at a driving rate not to exceed blows per inch .
Perform a load test on one or more of the test piles as shown on the Plans or as designated by the Engineer .
From driving logs for test piles and hold down piles load tests and other available subsoil information the Engineer will determine the number and length of piles to be used and the minimum required bearing .
The Engineer may require a test pile to be left in place for use cut off spliced or removed .
Load tests shall consist of a test load accomplished by loading weights on a platform or by jacking against holddown piles with a suitable apparatus for accurately measuring the test load and the pile settlement under each increment of load .
The pile load test apparatus for applying loads and measuring movement shall meet the requirements of ASTM D. Apply the load so as not to exert any undue bending stresses or damage to the pile .
The loading and calibration system shall be capable of applying and recording loads up to of the pile bearing values shown on the Plans .
Materials used in performing load tests shall remain the property of the Contractor .
Unless otherwise shown on the Plans wait a minimum of days between installing the load test pile and starting the test .
The Engineer may direct that load tests be added deleted or repeated and will make payment for such testing in accordance with ..
The Department based the number of load tests and test piles shown on the Plans on the assumption that the Contractor will drive all tests piles with the same pile driver as was used for the load test pile .
If choosing to drive some test piles with a different pile driver furnish the necessary additional load tests at no additional cost to the Department .
After the Engineer establishes the number and length of piles to be used the Contractor may drive regular piles with a different pile driver from that used for driving test piles provided it notifies the Engineer of Structures before pile lengths are established and uses a pile driver that conforms to the specified requirements. . Before driving a pile to be load tested submit to the Engineer written details outlining the method of applying measuring and recording test loads along with sufficient sketches to fully illustrate the method procedure and arrangements proposed .
For the jacks to be used in the tests submit to the Engineer calibration certificates from a laboratory approved by the Engineer .
Ensure that the certificates are no more than months old .
The following are the two methods for performing pile load tests .
Perform the quick load test unless directed otherwise on the Plans .
A .
Quick Load Test The full test load shall be of the pile load shown on the Plans .
Apply the load in approximately equal increments of to of the pile load as shown on the Plans and at intervals of minutes throughout the load test .
Take and record readings of time load and movement immediately before and after applying each load .
Apply the load until either a plunging failure occurs or the full test load is reached .
Plunging failure occurs when continuous jacking is required to maintain the test load .
After the final holding time or immediately after plunging failure occurs remove the applied load in five approximately equal decrements with intervals of minutes between decrements .
Take readings after removing each decrement and minutes after the complete removal of the test load .
B .
Maintained Load Test The full test load shall be of the pile load as shown on the Plans .
Apply the test load in maximum increments of of the pile load as shown on the Plans and at time intervals such that the rate of settlement does not exceed .
inch per hour per load increment for a minimum interval of hours .
Take and record readings of time load and movement immediately before and after applying each load increment .
The failing load is defined as the minimum load that produces one of the following conditions .
Rate of settlement exceeding .
inch per hour for a hour period. . Settlement occurring during the last hours of the full load test period . .
Permanent net settlement after rebound in excess of inch . .
When failure occurs under condition decrease the applied load as necessary until the rate of settlement is within the allowable limits to establish the failing load .
Take a final reading hour after complete removal of the load and accurately record the failing load .
The Department will pay the full value of the unit price bid for load tests .
The Engineer will decide to what extent if any the test pile will be considered as contributing to the support of the structure .
Should failure not occur due to condition carry the load test to completion with the full test load remaining on the pile for hours and then removed in six equal increments at hour intervals with readings taken after the removal of each increment and hour after the complete removal of the test load .
Although the terminology in this Subsection is related to driven piles it shall also apply to castinplace piles if so designated on the Plans .
After performing the load tests shown on the Plans the Contractor may choose to substitute piling of a different material or configuration from that shown on the Plans provided they meet the minimum design standards and specifications and are approved by the Engineer .
The required length of the substituted piling will be determined by additional load tests conducted at no cost to the Department .
The basis of payment for the piling shall be in accordance with .
except the total linear feet shall not exceed that established by load tests for the piles shown on the Plans .
When additional test piles that are load tested and deemed usable are made at plan location using the substituted material the Department will make payment at the unit bid price for regular piling. . Calibration Tests When diesel or other types of hammers requiring calibration are to be used calibrate the hammers by performing load tests as directed by the Engineer even if no load tests are called for in the Bid Schedule .
The Department will not require such calibrations if the hammer is to be used only for driving piles to rock or a fixed tip elevation or when the hammer is of a type and model that has previously been calibrated by sources acceptable to the Engineer for similar type size and length of pile and foundation material .
. . Order Lists for Piles The Engineer will furnish the Contractor with an itemized list showing the number and length as determined by tests of all required piles complete in place .
The Engineer will not prepare the list of piling for any portion of the foundation area until the required test data representative of that portion has been determined .
The Engineer will base the lengths given in the order list on the lengths that are assumed to remain in the completed structure .
Furnish the piles in accordance with the itemized list except at no additional cost to the Department increase the lengths to provide for fresh heading and for such additional length as may be necessary to suit the Contractors method of operation .
If during pile driving the conditions encountered require a change in lengths make such changes by cutting off piling if it is too long by furnishing new piling or by splicing as specified in .
if the piling is too short .
The Department will make no allowance for delays caused by the procedure of determining pile lengths . .
Storage and Handling Store and handle piles so as to avoid damaging them and as follows .
Store steel piles above ground and keep them free of dirt and grease and insofar as practicable corrosion. . To handle timber piles do not use hooks dogs pike poles or similar pointed tools and take care to avoid breaking their surface . .
Lift precast concrete piles by attaching a suitable bridle or sling to the pile at the points shown on the Plans. . Driving Piles Drive piles at the locations shown on the Plans or as directed in writing by the Engineer and to within an allowed variation as to direction of pile of not more than inch per foot of pile length with a maximum variation at the head of the pile from the position shown on the Plans of not more than inches .
To ensure proper positioning of each pile use templates .
constructed of heavy timbers or steel which are accurately positioned securely held in place and approved by the Engineer .
When using water jets ensure that the number of jets and the nozzle volume and pressure is sufficient to erode the material adjacent to the piling freely .
The pump shall have sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure of at least pounds per square inch at two inch jet nozzles .
Before the required penetration is reached shut off the jets and drive the piles by hammer to final penetration .
When preformed pile holes are used construct them by drilling or driving and withdrawing a suitable punch or chisel at or near the locations of the piles .
If preformed pile holes are so oversized that the sides of a round pile or the corners of a square pile are not in contact with the soil restore lateral stability by filling the space between the pile and the sides of the hole with approved clean sand at no cost to the Department .
Terminate preformed holes before the required penetration is reached and drive the pile by hammer to the final tip elevation to seat the pile and secure the minimum required bearing .
Except when the pile head is fitted into a steel head block provide every timber pile with a metal collar or wire wrapping .
Protect the heads of all concrete piles and the heads of all other piles when the nature of the driving is such that piles may be unduly damaged with caps of approved design having a plywood cushion next to the pile head and fitting into a casting which in turn supports a hammer cushion made from durable manufactured material .
Do not use wire rope and other materials of limited durability .
Use an approved pile cushion of sufficient thickness to prevent damage to the pile during driving .
Use a minimum initial dimension of inch thick plywood pile cushion for concrete piles .
Replace the pile cushion before excessive compression more than the original thickness burning or charring takes place .
During hard driving several pile cushions may be necessary for a single pile .
Use a new pile cushion for each pile .
For special types of piling provide driving heads mandrels or other devices in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations so that the pile may be driven without damage .
For steel piling squarely cut the heads and provide a driving cap to align the axis of the pile with the axis of the hammer .
When shown on the Plans cap steel piles with steel plates or other devices. . Use full length piles where practicable .
In exceptional circumstances the Engineer may allow splicing of piles .
Splice as specified in ..
Install production piles full length except terminate driving when practical refusal as defined in .
has been reached .
If production piles do not achieve the minimum required bearing when driven full length the Engineer will determine if additional piles are required .
The tip elevation for all production piles shall be equal to or below the minimum pile tip elevation shown on the Plans .
When the required pile penetration can not be achieved by driving without exceeding practical refusal use other penetration aids such as jetting or preformed pile holes .
If piles are raised during driving of other piles or by any other cause drive them down again at no cost to the Department . .
Bearing Value and Penetration When the Bid Schedule provides for load tests the Engineer will determine the minimum number of hammer blows per unit of pile penetration needed to obtain the specified bearing value based on load tests performed as specified in .
and ..
In the absence of load tests the Engineer will determine the safe bearing value based on test pile data .
Each driven pile or shell shall have a minimum bearing value as shown on the Plans or as specified by the Engineer given the results of the load test or test pile data .
Drive piles with the same driving system fuel setting hammer cushion and pile cushion as the test piles or the pile that was load tested .
Piles used to penetrate a very soft upper stratum overlying a hard stratum shall penetrate the hard material a sufficient distance to fix the pile rigidly . .
Determination of Bearing Value In the absence of load tests the Engineer will determine the safe bearing value by one of the following formulas .
Gravity Hammers 𝑃 𝑊𝐻 𝑆 . .
Single Acting Steam or Air Hammers and Diesel Hammers with Unrestricted Rebound 𝑃 𝑊𝐻 𝑆 . .
Double Acting Steam or Air Hammers 𝑃 𝐻𝑊 𝐴𝑝 𝑆 . .
Double Acting Steam or Air Hammers and Diesel Hammers Having Enclosed Rams 𝑃 𝐸 𝑆 .
Where P Safe load per pile in pounds W Weight of the striking part of the hammer in pounds A Area of piston in square inches p Steam pressure in pounds per square inch at hammer H Height of fall in feet for gravity steam and air hammers and observed average height of fall in feet of blows used to determine penetration for diesel hammers with unrestricted rebound of ram S Average penetration per blow in inches for the last to blows of a gravity hammer or the last to blows of a steam air or diesel hammer and E Manufacturers rating for footpounds of energy developed by double acting steam or air hammers and of the average equivalent energy in foot pounds as determined by a gauge attached to the pile hammer and recorded during the period when the average penetration per blow is recorded for diesel hammers having enclosed rams .
Hammers of this type shall be equipped with a gauge and applicable charts supplied that will evaluate the equivalent energy being produced under any driving condition .
The above formulas are applicable only when . .
The hammer has a free fall .
The head of the pile is free from broomed or crushed wood fiber or other serious impairment .
The penetration is at a reasonably quick and uniform rate .
There is no appreciable bounce after the blow .
The weight of pile is no more than the weight of hammer used if hammer is of the gravity type and .
A follower is not used .
If there is an appreciable bounce twice the height of bounce will be deducted from H to determine its value in the formula .
The bearing power as determined by the appropriate formula in the list above will be considered effective only when it is less than the crushing strength of the pile .
Other recognized formulas for determining pilebearing power may be used if fully detailed in the Special Provisions .
When the safe bearing value of any pile is found by test or computation to be less than the design load drive longer piles or additional piles as directed in writing by the Engineer . .
Inspection of Shells for CastinPlace Piling After the shell has been driven and the core withdrawn obtain the Engineers approval of the shell before placing any concrete .
Remove and replace shells that have been improperly driven do not hold their proper form and dimensions or are broken or otherwise defective. . Extensions and Splices A .
Steel and Timber Piles Use full length steel or timber piles where practicable .
If splices can not be avoided use a method of splicing as shown on the Plans .
Spliced piles shall have a full true and even bearing at the joint .
Do not splice timber piles in abutments. . B. Precast Concrete Piles Extend precast concrete piles by removing the concrete at the end of the pile and leaving the reinforcement steel exposed for a length of diameters .

Ensure that each plant has a quality control plan as specified in .. B. . Forms Unless otherwise allowed for external forms provide metal forms that are mortartight and sufficiently rigid to prevent distortion due to pressure of the concrete and other stresses incident to the construction operations .
The forms shall be substantial and unyielding and designed set and maintained so that the finished concrete will conform to the proper dimensions and contours .
Provide forms that are filleted at sharp corners and that have a bevel or draft in the case of projections to allow for easy removal .
Wooden bulkheads may be used .

maximum Each individual form shall have a crosssectional area equal to the cross sectional area of the beam void and a minimum length of feet .
When individual forms are constructed by gluing pieces together use an approved glue .
The Engineer will reject forms that show signs of glued joint separations. . Stressing Requirements General Calibrate all jacks together with their gauges before using in the manufacture of prestressed members .
When required by the Department perform calibrations using proving rings or other acceptable methods performed by an approved testing laboratory at the Contractors expense .
Have a calibration chart for each device readily available on site and also furnish such charts to the Department .
Recalibrate jacks and gauges at least once every months .
Provide means for measuring the elongation of reinforcement to at least the nearest inch .
For all methods of tensioning determine the force in the tendons by monitoring either the applied force or the elongation and then independently checking by measuring the other .
At the completion of tensioning operations the two control measurements force and elongation shall agree within of the computed theoretical values .
If discrepancies exceed suspend the tensioning operation and use qualified personnel to determine and evaluate the source of error before proceeding .
If the source of the discrepancy can not be determined recalibrate the devices .
Additionally ensure that the control measurements of force and elongation algebraically agree with each other within .
If the measurements do not agree within the Contractor may add a load cell at the dead end and if force measurements agree within between the gauge at the live end and the load cell at the dead end the Department will waive the requirement for elongation agreement . .
When taking elongation and gauge readings include appropriate allowances for chuck seating bed shortening under load abutment rotation thermal effects gauge correction based on calibration data friction and any other compensation for the setup .
To measure the tensioning force use one or more of the following methods .
Pressure gauges to measure force from the pressure applied to hydraulic jacks. . Dynamometers connected in tension into the tensioning system. . Load cells connected into the tensioning system so the action of the tensioning operation imparts a compressive force to the sensing element. . Digital readouts connected to a pressure transducer to measure force from the pressure applied to the hydraulic jack. . Force computed from the actual elongation of the strand based on its physical properties and compensation adjustments .
For pretensioned members establish independent references adjacent to each anchorage to indicate any yielding or slippage that may occur between the time of initial stressing and final release of the cables .
Stressing of strands for pretensioned members or tendons for posttensioned members may be from one end unless otherwise indicated .
However if there is a discrepancy of more than between stresses in the strand or tendon as computed from the elongation measurement and those indicated by gauge readings perform jacking from both ends. . Pretensioning Procedure Apply to each cable the amount of stress shown on the Plans .
Perform pretensioning by either the single strand or multistrand jacking method .
When prestressing is performed by the multistrand jacking method bring the cables to a uniform initial tension of approximately pounds before applying the full pretensioning stress .
Measure the initial tension of each cable by a dynamometer or other approved means. . After the initial tensioning stress the cables until the required elongation and jacking pressure are attained and reconciled within the limits specified in ..
Tension the deflected pretensioned strands by either partially jacking at the end of the bed followed by raising or lowering the strands to their final position or entirely by jacking with the strands being held in their final position during the jacking operation .
Tension the deflected strands so that the final tension in all parts of the strand is uniform and provide means to reduce frictional forces at the bend points to a minimum .
When strands are deflected after partial tensioning raise or depress the strands simultaneously at all points or in an approved specific sequence .
Obtain the Engineers approval of strand splicing methods and devices .
When using single strand jacking provide only one splice per strand .
When using multistrand jacking either splice all strands or no more than of the strands .
Spliced strands shall be similar in physical properties from the same source and shall have the same twist or lay .
Locate all splices outside of the prestressed units .
The Engineer may accept wire failures provided not more than one wire in any strand is broken and the area of broken wires does not exceed of the total area of the strands .
After final stressing all strands shall be positioned as shown on the Plans and the stress in the strands shall be uniformly distributed throughout the bed length .
With the cables stressed in accordance with the Plan requirements and the foregoing Specifications and with all other reinforcing in place cast the members to the lengths specified .
Maintain cable stress between anchorages until the concrete reaches the compressive strength specified in .. . Proportioning and Mixing of Concrete Proportion Class P concrete as specified in Table .. . Table .

Handling and Placement Handle and place concrete for prestressed bridge members as follows .
Before placing any concrete clean the forms of construction debris and other extraneous matter .
Place and secure the reinforcing bars of the size and type specified as shown on the Plans. . Place concrete in the forms immediately after mixing .
Do not use any concrete that does not reach its final position in the forms within minutes after adding the cement to the mix .
Place the concrete so as to prevent segregation of the materials and displacement of the reinforcement. . Use metal or metallined open troughs and chutes and keep them clean and free from hardened concrete .
Discharge water used in flushing clear of the forms. . Keep the temperature of forms headers cables reinforcing bars or other steel that comes in contact with freshly placed concrete to below F during casting operation except keep forms for deck panels below F. . Do not begin to place concrete if the ambient temperature is below F and if the ambient temperature falls below F during the placement of concrete discontinue the placement as soon as practicable. . Do not begin placing concrete during precipitating weather and if precipitating weather occurs during the pouring operation only leave the area where the concrete is being placed uncovered .
Limit this uncovered area to no more than feet of bed length .
. . Do not deposit any concrete until the Engineer has inspected and approved the placement of the reinforcement conduits anchorages and prestressing steel .
Clean all exposed steel of all concrete other than light deposits of cement paste immediately after placing and consolidation is completed .
B .
Consolidation During and immediately after the placing operation consolidate the concrete with vibrators and suitable spading tools .
Apply vibration at the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited concrete .
The vibrators used may be internal or external or a combination of both .
Vibrate for a sufficient duration and intensity to compact the concrete thoroughly but so as not to cause segregation .
Place concrete in the precast units in one continuous operation for each unit except for the minimum delay required for installing voids .
Deposit and consolidate the concrete so that the concrete will be smooth and dense and free from honeycomb and pockets of segregated aggregates .
Give roadway surfaces a Class finish as specified in .. C. .
Removing Forms Finishing and Curing A .
Removing Forms The Contractor may remove side forms as soon after hours as their removal will not cause distortion of the hardened concrete .

B. Finishing Finish all formed surfaces of the bridge members as specified in ..
The Contractor may use other methods when approved by the Engineer .
Finish roadway surfaces of the members as specified in .. C. Transversely score the top surface of members that will not become a part of the roadway surface with a stiff wire brush or by other approved methods .
After removing hold down devices from the bottom of the beams coat the resulting holes with an approved bonding compound and plug with mortar. . C. Curing Cure the bridge members by the water method or by steam curing as specified below .
The Contractor may use other methods provided the details of the proposed methods are submitted to the Department and approved. . Water Curing .
As soon as the concrete has hardened to a degree that the finish will not be harmed perform water curing as follows a .
Cover the member with a predampened material suitable for use with the water cure .
b .
Keep continuously and thoroughly wet until the member has attained the strength required for stress transfer with a minimum curing time of hours .
Do not cure using the water method when the ambient temperature is expected to drop below F. .
Steam Curing .
Perform steam curing as follows a .
After placing and vibrating the concrete wait until the member attains initial set to hours or to hours if a set retarder has been used before applying steam .
If the ambient air temperature is below F apply enough steam during the delay period to hold the air surrounding the member at a minimum temperature of F and a maximum of F greater than the temperature of the concrete at placement .
b .
To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces during the delay period cover members as soon as possible after casting or keep the exposed surfaces wet by fog spray or wet blankets .
c. Perform steam curing beneath suitable enclosures that will allow free circulation of steam about the sides ends and tops of members and that will contain the live steam with a minimum moisture loss .
The Contractor may use tarpaulins or similar flexible covers provided they are kept in good repair and secured in a manner that will prevent the loss of significant steam and moisture. . d. Steam at the jets shall be low pressure and in a saturated condition .
Steam jets shall not impinge directly on the concrete test cylinders or forms .
During application of the steam the temperature rise within the enclosure shall not exceed F per hour .
The curing temperature throughout the enclosure shall be not less than F nor more than F and the relative humidity shall be not less than .
The difference in the temperature adjacent to the concrete at different locations within the enclosure shall not exceed F at any time .
Continue steam curing until the concrete has reached the required transfer strength .
In discontinuing the steam do not reduce the temperature within the enclosure more than F per hour until the temperature inside is within F of the temperature outside .
The minimum time from the end of placement and finishing operations to the removal of required covers shall not be less than hours .
e. When curing has been done at elevated temperatures begin to transfer the prestressing load after releasing the forms and discontinuing the steam and while the concrete is still hot in order to prevent cooling shrinking and cracking .
If so directed by the Engineer cover members or otherwise protect them so as to cool the concrete slowly after release in order to prevent thermal shock and the evaporation of moisture in the members .
f. Provide temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous permanent record of the curing temperature .
Provide a minimum of one recording device per feet of continuous bed length with a minimum of two devices per bed .
g. Leave side forms in place a minimum of hours after the concrete is cast or until the concrete has set sufficiently to withstand damage when the forms are removed .
When the side forms are removed during the curing cycle only remove the minimum area of the curing enclosure that is necessary to remove each individual form section area in the enclosure .
Immediately close the open area in the enclosure as each form section is removed. . h. When the temperature is not expected to rise above F protect the beams from freezing temperatures until the design strength is reached. . PostTensioning Procedure When posttensioning set the anchor plates normal in all directions to the axis of the steel .
In all stressing operations keep the stressing forces symmetrical about the vertical axis of the member .
Do not begin tensioning until the concrete has reached a compressive strength of at least pounds per square inch unless otherwise shown on the Plans .
The amount of tensioning to be retained in each posttensioned unit after anchorage shall be as shown on the Plans .
Apply a slight overstress as determined in the field to overcome friction between steel and enclosure and to allow for relaxation of the anchorage .
Tension the units until the required elongations and jacking pressures are attained and reconciled within the limits specified in .
with such overstress as approved by the Engineer for anchorage relaxation .
Then allow the male anchorage element to be driven home by the jack action .
Conduct the tensioning process so that the tension being applied and the elongation of the prestressing elements may be measured at all times .
