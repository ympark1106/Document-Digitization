SECTION The Vicat time of set for the material shall be determined in accordance with AASHTO T . The time of set shall be within percent or minutes of the time of set specified by the manufacturer whichever is greater .
The time of final setting shall be a maximum of eight hours .
The compressive strength shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of CRDC Corps of Engineers Specification For Nonshrink Grouts .
The minimum compressive strength at seven days shall be pounds per square inch and the minimum compressive strength at days shall be pounds per square inch .
Nonshrink grouts with high early strength development as stated by the manufacturer will be tested for conformance to the manufacturers claims .
The compressive strength of nonshrink grout material at days shall be equal to or greater than the day compressive strength requirement of the concrete to be patched .
The expansion percent for the nonshrink grout material shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of CRDC .
The maximum expansion shall be .
percent when measured at and days .
The percent shrinkage at days shall be zero .
