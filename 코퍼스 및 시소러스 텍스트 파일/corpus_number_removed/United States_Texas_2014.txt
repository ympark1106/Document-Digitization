Time Impact Analysis .
When directed provide a time impact analysis .
A time impact analysis is an evaluation of the effects of impacts on the project .

Establish the status of the project immediately before the impact .
Step .
Predict the effect of the impact on the schedule update used in Step .
Step .
Track the effects of the impact on the schedule during its occurrence .
Step .
Establish the status of the project after the impacts effect has ended and provide details identifying any mitigating actions or circumstances used to keep the project ongoing during the impact period .
Determine the time impact by comparing the status of the work before the impact Step to the prediction of the effect of the impact Step if requested and to actual effects of the impact once it is complete Step .
Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer steps and must be completed before consideration of a Contract time extension or adjustment of a milestone date will be provided .
Time extensions will only be considered when delays that affect milestone dates or the Contract completion date are beyond the Contractors control .
Submit Step no later than calendar days after the impacts effects have ended or when all the information on the effect has been realized .
Submit one electronic backup copy of the complete time impact analysis and a copy of the full project schedule incorporating the time impact analysis .
If the project schedule is revised after the submittal of a time impact analysis but before its approval indicate in writing the need for any modification to the time impact analysis .
The Engineer will review the time impact analysis upon completion of step .
If this review detects revisions or changes to the schedule that had not been performed and identified in a narrative the Engineer may reject the time impact analysis .
If the Engineer is in agreement with the time impact analysis a change order may be issued to grant additional working days or to adjust interim milestones .
Once a change order has been executed incorporate the time impact analysis into the project schedule .
The time impact analysis may also be used to support the settlement of disputes and claims .
Compensation related to the time impact analysis may be provided at the completion of the analysis or the completion of the project to determine the true role the impact played on the final completion. .

C . Pavement temperatures are estimated from air temperatures using an algorithm contained in a Departmentsupplied computer program may be provided by the Department or by following the procedures outlined in AASHTO MP and PP . .
This requirement may be waived at the Departments discretion if the supplier warrants that the asphalt binder can be adequately pumped mixed and compacted at temperatures that meet all applicable safety environmental and constructability requirements .
At test temperatures where the binder is a Newtonian fluid any suitable standard means of viscosity measurement may be used including capillary T or T or rotational viscometry T . . Viscosity at C is an indicator of mixing and compaction temperatures that can be expected in the lab and field .
High values may indicate high mixing and compaction temperatures .
Additionally significant variation can occur from batch to batch .
Contractors should be aware that variation could significantly impact their mixing and compaction operations .
Contractors are therefore responsible for addressing any constructability issues that may arise. . For quality control of unmodified asphalt binder production measurement of the viscosity of the original asphalt binder may be substituted for dynamic shear measurements of Gsin at test temperatures where the asphalt is a Newtonian fluid .
Any suitable standard means of viscosity measurement may be used including capillary T or T or rotational viscometry T . . Silicone beam molds as described in AASHTO TP are acceptable for use . .
If creep stiffness is below MPa direct tension test is not required .
If creep stiffness is between and MPa the direct tension failure strain requirement can be used instead of the creep stiffness requirement .
The mvalue requirement must be satisfied in both cases . .

.. Pneumatic Placement of Concrete .
Pneumatically applied concrete can be either drymix or wetmix .
The drymix process consists of drymixed fine aggregate and hydraulic cement to which water is added immediately before its pneumatic expulsion from a nozzle .
The wetmix process consists of mechanically premixed concrete pneumatically applied through a nozzle .
General .
Place the concrete when the ambient temperature is above F and rising and material temperature is between F and F for wetmix and below F for drymix .
Do not place concrete against a surface containing frost ice or standing water .
Protect concrete from freezing or quick drying after placement .
Apply the concrete using pneumatic equipment that sprays the mix onto the prepared surface at a velocity less than ft. per second for construction of portions of structures repairing concrete structures or encasement of structural steel members .
Minimize rebound and produce a compacted dense homogenous mass .
Do not apply concrete if high winds will prevent proper application or if rain could wash out the concrete .
Hold the nozzle approximately to ft. from the surface and position it so the concrete impinges nearly at right angles to the surface being covered .
Use shooting strips to ensure straight lines square corners and a plane surface of concrete .
Place to keep the trapping of rebound to a minimum .
Slope the concrete off to a thin edge at the end of each days work or at similar stopping periods requiring construction joint .
Thoroughly clean and wet previously placed concrete before placing an adjacent or additional section .
Apply a sufficient number of coats to obtain the required thickness .
Place coats on vertical and overhead surfaces in layers of such thickness to prevent sloughing sagging tearing or debonding .
Provide a sufficient interval between successive layers in sloping vertical or overhead work to allow initial but not final set .
Clean the surface to remove the thin film of laitance to provide for a bond with succeeding applications .
Remove rebound and accumulated loose sand from the surface to be covered before placing of the original or succeeding layers of concrete .
Correct any sags or other defects to the proper section as directed .
Place concrete to completely encase reinforcing steel .
Encase reinforcing steel by shooting with sufficient velocity and plasticity that material flows around and behind reinforcement .
Apply the concrete using either the wetmix or drymix process unless otherwise noted on the plans .
Mix the materials thoroughly and uniformly using a paddle or drum type mixer designed for pneumatic application .
Wetmix process applications can use transitmix concrete .
Do not use the wetmix process for repair of damaged concrete .
Clean mixing and placing equipment at regular intervals .
Inspect the nozzle liner and water and air injection system daily replace worn parts as necessary .
Do not reuse rebound or overspray concrete .
DryMix Process .
Use a compressor or blower capable of delivering a sufficient volume of oilfree air at the pressure shown in Table .
Maintain steady pressure throughout the placing process .
Use a water pump with the size and capacity to deliver water to the nozzle with a pressure at least psi more than the required air pressure .
The values shown in Table are based on a hose length of ft. with the nozzle less than ft. above the delivery equipment .
Increase operating pressure approximately psi for each additional ft. of hose and approximately psi for each ft. the nozzle is raised .

Use mixing equipment capable of thoroughly mixing the materials in sufficient quantity to maintain continuous placement .
.. Construction Joints .
Use a square butt joint where the joint is subject to compressive stress or is over existing construction joints unless noted otherwise on the plans .
Use tapered or square butt joints at other locations .
Square the outside in .
of tapered joints perpendicular to the surface .
..
Finish .
Use a sharp trowel to cut off all high spots after the concrete has been placed to the desired thickness or screed to a true plane as determined by shooting strips or by the original concrete surface .
Lightly apply cutting screeds where used to all surfaces so as not to disturb the concrete for an appreciable depth .
Work in an upward direction when concrete is applied on vertical surfaces .
Give the finished concrete a final flash coat of about in .
unless directed otherwise .
Obtain a uniform appearance on all exposed surfaces unless otherwise shown on the plans .
.. Curing .
Cure encasements with water for days .
