The subsurface information furnished in the Contract is based on the interpretation by the Department of investigations made only at the specific locations indicated and the Department gives no assurance that the conditions discovered are typical of the conditions at other Project site locations or that those conditions will have remained unchanged since the field data were obtained .
The Department also gives no assurance that the presence or absence of subsurface water at the time and locations of these explorations will be representative of actual conditions at the time of construction .
Such subsurface information as was obtained by the Department for its use in the design of the Project will be available for inspection by bidders through the Division of Contracts .
Also bidders may arrange through the Division of Contracts an opportunity to examine in advance of bidding at a location to be specified by the Department any available samples of the materials encountered in the Departments subsurface explorations .
The Contractor shall be solely responsible for all assumptions deductions or conclusions it may make or derive from its examination of any Department subsurface information document or sample .
In furnishing or making available such information the Department makes no warranty or representation as to the actual conditions that may be encountered or actual quantities or distribution of quantities of work that will be required in the course of the Project .
The Department does not intend or warrant that plan sheets furnished to the State by utility companies whose facilities may be affected by the proposed construction will show all proposed utility work that will be done by utility companies or municipal authorities or both before during or after the life of this Contract .
In addition to the work indicated on such plan sheets the utility companies and authorities may make adjustments to or remove certain of their installations other than those indicated on the plans or may install facilities not so indicated .
Bidders must inform the Department in writing at the earliest opportunity of any and all omissions errors or discrepancies that the bidder discovers within or among the plans specifications and bidding documents .
Information and inquiries concerning such matters and any other information or inquiry concerning the conditions of bidding or award or the interpretation of contract documents must be transmitted in writing to the Manager of Contracts Connecticut Department of Transportation P. O .
Box Newington Connecticut .
The Department can not ensure a response to inquiries received later than days prior to the scheduled opening of the related bid .
When the Department deems it warranted responses to such inquiries that relate to .. changes in or interpretations of the Project documents plans and specifications will be issued to all bidders in the form of addenda and made a part of the Contract .
Bidders are responsible for ensuring that they are aware of all addenda .
Failure by the Department or postal or other courier services to deliver addenda or other information regarding a Contract being bid does not release the bidder from any obligations under said addenda or the conditions of the bid .
.. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Vacant .. Knowledge of Applicable Laws Bidders shall be deemed to know and understand all federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations and municipal bylaws which in any manner apply to projects for which they bid such legal requirements shall include but not necessarily be limited to those which apply to the conduct of the Contract work the equipment and materials to be used on the Project or the treatment of individuals or classes of individuals in relationship to their involvement with the Project .
A Contractors ignorance of such requirements shall not in any internal Department proceeding or in any claims or other legal proceeding constitute justification for the Contractors failure to consider such requirements in formulating a bid proposal or for the Contractors failure to ensure that such legal requirements are met with regard to any Department project in which that Contractor participates .
The Contractor agrees that if it should be awarded the contract for any project supported at least in part by federal funding the Contractor will not knowingly enter into any lower tier transaction on that project with a person including entities who by virtue of federal law or regulation or by voluntary agreement is currently ineligible to participate in such a project unless after disclosure of such ineligibility such participation is authorized by appropriate federal and State authorities .
The Department expects the Contractor to obey municipal laws and regulations and cooperate with municipal officials .
In some instances however municipal laws or regulations or the orders of municipal officials may conflict with necessary Project activities .
In most such cases the municipality does not have the legal power to enforce its laws and regulations upon the State or upon a State project .
This is because the State is protected by its sovereign immunity .
If local police or other authorities should attempt to stop the Contractor from carrying out activities that are necessary in order for the Contractor to comply with Contract requirements the Contractor should politely inform the municipal authorities that they probably do not have jurisdiction over the States project and the Contractor should immediately inform the Engineer of the attempted interference with Project activities .
If the municipal authorities continue to insist upon preventing the Contractor from carrying out Project activities the Contractor should not .. defy the authorities but to the extent possible should await directions from the Engineer .

The Contractor may submit to the Engineer a request to use equipment or methods other than those specified in the Contract .
If the Engineer so directs there shall be a trial of such equipment or methods .
If the results of the trial are satisfactory to the Engineer the Contractor may begin using the proposed equipment or method on the Project .
Failure of the equipment or method to meet the specified Contract performance standards in the course of the specified trial or in the absence of such standards a failure to perform to the satisfaction of the Engineer shall be cause for rejection of any such method or equipment and any work performed with either .
Such rejected equipment or work shall be removed immediately from the Project site .
.. Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer The Engineer may suspend the Project wholly or in part for such period or periods as he considers to be in the best interests of the State including but not limited to the interests of public necessity convenience or safety .
During such periods of suspension and subject to any related directions from the Engineer the Contractor shall store all materials and equipment in a way that will keep .. them from obstructing or impeding the traveling public unnecessarily and that will keep the materials from being damaged shall take all reasonable measures to prevent damage to the work performed shall provide suitable drainage of the roadway and Project site by opening ditches shoulder drains etc .
as appropriate and shall erect temporary structures to prevent damage to the Project or to other property and to protect the public where and when necessary .
The Contractor shall maintain the Project site and all roadways and buildings thereon in a condition safe for travel or occupancy and shall maintain all required barricades signs and lights during the period of suspension If the Engineer orders in writing that performance of all or any portion of the Project shall be suspended or that it shall be delayed for an unreasonable period of time not customary within the scope of possibilities that an experienced contractor should know might occur on a construction project or inherent in the nature of construction activities and if the Contractor believes that additional compensation or Contract time is due to it as a result of such suspension or delay the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for a related Contract adjustment within calendar days of the Contractors receipt of a direction from the Engineer to resume work .
The request shall set forth the specific reasons and support for the requested adjustment .
Upon receipt of the Contractors request the Engineer will evaluate the request .
If the Engineer agrees that the expenditures or time required for the Contractors performance of the Contract have increased as a result of such suspension or delay and if the suspension or delay was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor its suppliers or subcontractors at any approved tier and was not caused by weather the Engineer will make an appropriate adjustment excluding any profit of the written terms of the Contract .
The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the determination as to whether or not the requested adjustment of the Contract is warranted and will be made .
No Contract adjustment will be made unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed .
In addition to the other limits and requirements imposed by this article no Contract adjustment will be allowed under this article to the extent a that the Project work would have been suspended or delayed by any cause other than the ones identified in the Contractors request or b that the requested adjustment or type of adjustment is provided for or barred by another provision of the Contract .
With regard to Items above refer to CFR Section .
Standardized Changed Condition Clauses Required FHWA Contract Specification .
.. Determination of Contract Time Unless the Contract requires the Project completion by a specified date the number of calendar days allowed for the completion of the Project will be fixed by the Department will be stated in the Contract and will be known with any subsequent adjustments as the Contract time .
If at any time the Contractor submits a schedule showing completion of the work more than calendar days in advance of the Contract completion date the Department will issue a nocost construction order revising the allowable Contract time to that shown on the Contractors schedule .
.. Rev .
January When the Contract time is stated on a calendarday basis that time shall be the number of consecutive calendar days contained in the Contract period designated in the Contract excluding the time period from each December through the following March the winter shutdown period .
The Contract time will begin to run on the date designated in the Engineers Notice to Proceed as the date for commencement of the Project and the time will be computed as herein provided on a consecutiveday basis including all Saturdays Sundays holidays and nonwork days from April through November of each included year .
Time will not be charged for days in the winter shutdown period except for time used in working on planting projects and any other projects with regard to which the Standard Specifications or Project bid documents provide otherwise .
If the Engineer so approves the Contractor may work on the Project during the winter shutdown period with no charge being made against the Contract time .
If the time specified for completion of the Project with time extensions is due to expire before December of a given year but the Project has not been completed by that December the time charged to the Contractor will continue through the winter shutdown period .
The total elapsed time in calendar days computed as described above from the commencement date specified in the Engineers Notice to Proceed to the Substantial Completion date specified in the Engineers Notice of Substantial Completion shall be considered as the time used in the performance of the Contract work .
Suspension involving cessation of work on all items except minor construction not affected by or connected with the cause of suspension shall be considered as total suspension .
In case of a total suspension of the Project ordered by the Engineer not due to any fault of the Contractor the elapsed time during which the Project is suspended will not be charged against the Contract time .
Work of an emergency nature ordered by the Engineer for the convenience or safety of the public or the protection of the Project work if performed during a period of total suspension will not be charged against Contract time .
No such time allowance will be granted in case of partial suspension provided however that the Contractor may request and the Engineer may grant permission to perform specific limited operations during such a partial suspension in which case Contract time chargeable for those operations shall be negotiated and agreed to in writing before such operations may commence .
.. Extension of Time The Contractor may present to the Engineer a request in writing for an extension of Contract time if the time necessary for completion of the Project has been increased due to extra or added work or delays resulting from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor except for weather or seasonal conditions unless extraordinary and catastrophic .
Such causes include but are not limited to natural catastrophes acts of the State in either its sovereign or contractual capacity acts of another contractor in the performance of a contract with the State the presence of utility facilities including railroads fires strikes floods or delays by suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or such suppliers .
The Contractors plea that insufficient Contract time was allowed under the Contract before commencement of the Project is not a valid reason for extending the Contract .. Rev .
January time .
Requests for an extension of time with adequate substantiation must be presented within calendar days from the event that is the basis of the request or from the first effect of such an event on the Project .
The Contractor will be responsible for providing all the documentation necessary to support the reasonableness of the additional time requested .
This shall include a Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis and accompanying narrative that includes the specific dates and number of days for which the extension is sought the basis or bases for the extension and the schedule analysis illustrated in a graphic representation of the schedule impacts such as a bar chart or other type of graphical schedule .
The critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
Such requests will be considered by the Engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
Requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the Contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the Contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the Project as to materials labor or equipment .
For all Project delays or time increases except as provided below additional Contract time is the sole remedy that the Contractor may have and such periods of additional Contract time shall be deemed NonCompensable Delays .
For delays caused by the State in its Contractual capacity the Contractor may in addition to a time extension request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay and such periods of extended Contract time may be deemed Compensable Delays .
The period of compensable delay is limited as follows It may not include time more than days prior to the Engineers receiving written notice from the Contractor with adequate substantiation of its intent to claim damages for the delay and It may not include periods of delay for which the State was responsible but during which the Contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the State was not responsible .
Damages for periods of Project delay for which the State had sole responsibility shall be limited to the increased costs incurred by the Contractor which shall not include lost profits which the Contractor substantiates and which the Contractor shows were caused by such delays .
If an approved extension of Contract time extends beyond November the number of days of the approved extension remaining on that date will not begin to run again until the following April .
The Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis shall include at a minimum .
The manner in which the Contractor planned to construct the Project in terms of activities logical interrelationships of activities work sequences activity durations and calendars . .
The actual duration and sequences of the activities based on what actually occurred on the Project . .
The variances between the planned and actual performance of the work listed in a chronological and cumulative manner summing to the net total delay on the Project at the time of the request .

Statements as to whether the time extension days sought are compensable or noncompensable along with a specific statement of any compensation requested in connection with the time extension .
Any request for a time extension that does not include a corresponding request for compensation will be assumed to be a request for a noncompensable time extension. . All associated analysis documents worksheets schedules and contemporaneous documents supporting the Critical Path Method Schedule Delay Analysis .
.. Failure to Complete Work on Time Time is an essential element of the Contract .
Since the prosecution of the Project may obstruct traffic interfere with business and otherwise inconvenience the public it is important that the Project be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the Contract including engineering inspection and supervision will also be increased as the time for Project completion is lengthened .
Therefore for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the Contract time has expired the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the Contract shall be deducted from any money due to the Contractor .
Liquidated damages are not a penalty but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .
If the last day of the initial Contract time or the initial Contract date determined for Substantial Completion is before December in the given year liquidated damages as specified in the Contract shall be assessed against the Contractor per calendar day including any days during a winter shutdown period from that day until the date on which the Project is substantially completed .
The Engineer has the right to deduct the amount of the liquidated damages assessed against the Contractor from any estimated payment for work performed under the Contract or under any other State contract or from any other sums owed by the State to the Contractor or to claim and recover such sums by process of law .
.. Termination of Contract for Cause The Commissioner may give notice in writing to the Contractor and its surety of any delay neglect or default of the Contractor which the Commissioner believes has occurred including one or more of the following .
Failure to begin the Project on the date specified in the Notice to Proceed. . Failure to perform the Project with sufficient personnel equipment or materials to ensure timely Project completion. . Unsuitable performance of the Project or failure to perform Project work in accordance with the Contract. . Failure or refusal to remove or correct work rejected by the Engineer. .

Violation of any provisions of the Contract. . Any other cause which in the judgment of the Commissioner warrants termination including but not limited to violations of the antitrust or criminal laws and attempts to deceive or defraud the Department in material matters .
If the Contractor or surety within a period of calendar days after such notice does not proceed in conformance with the directions set forth in the notification or fails to present a remedial plan of operation satisfactory to the Commissioner then the Commissioner may at his discretion order the surety to complete the Project or without violating the Contract take the right to control and prosecute the Project out of the hands of said Contractor and surety .
No termination of the Contract for such cause will be deemed to have occurred however unless the Commissioner himself or herself and not merely a designated representative of his or hers expressly declares it in a writing to the Contractor .
The Department may acquire or rent whatever materials or equipment are necessary in order to complete the Project and may seize and use for purposes of the Project with any appropriate compensation to the Contractor any material or equipment that the Contractor acquired or purchased expressly for the Project in accordance with a specific Contract requirement .
The Department may also enter into an agreement either by negotiation or public letting for the completion of the Contract according to the terms and provisions thereof or use such other methods or combinations thereof as in the Commissioners opinion shall be required or desirable for the completion of the Contract in an acceptable manner .
All costs and charges incurred by the Department in connection with completing the Project under the Contract or as a result of the Contractors default shall be deducted from any monies due to or which may become due to the Contractor .
In case such expense exceeds the sum which would have been payable under the Contract then the Contractor and the surety shall be liable for and shall pay to the State the amount of the excess .
.. Final Cleaning Up The Project will not be considered complete and will not be accepted until the rights of way borrow pits and all other ground both public and private occupied by the Contractor in connection with the Project has been cleared of all surplus and discarded materials rubbish and temporary structures .

All ditches waterways drainage structures and culverts constructed under the Contract shall be cleaned and cleared of obstructions by the Contractor and shall be left in a condition acceptable to the Engineer .
When so directed by the Engineer the Contractor shall clean all existing ditches waterways drainage structures and culverts of obstructions resulting from Project operations .
..
.. Final Inspection If the Engineer determines that the work may be substantially complete a Semi Final Inspection will be held as soon as practical .
After the Semi Final Inspection is held and the Engineer determines that the requirements for Substantial Completion have been satisfied the Engineer will prepare a Notice of Substantial Completion .
When the Contractor has completed all work listed in the Notice of Substantial Completion the Contractor shall prepare a written notice requesting a Final Inspection and a Certificate of Acceptance of Work .
The Engineer will hold an Inspection of the Project as soon as practical after the Engineer determines that the Project may be completed .
If the Engineer deems the Project complete said inspection shall constitute the Final Inspection and the Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing that the Final Inspection has been performed .
If the inspection discloses any unsatisfactory or incomplete Project work the Engineer will notify the Contractor of such deficiencies .
The Contractor shall immediately correct the deficiencies .
Upon such correction another inspection will be made that shall then constitute the Final Inspection provided that the work has been satisfactorily completed .
On projects consisting of two or more individual geographicallyseparated sections of roadways sites or physicallyseparated buildings or portions of buildings a partial final inspection of individual fullycompleted sections will be performed by the Engineer if the Contractor so requests .
If at any time during the prosecution of the Project the Contractor substantially completes a unit or portion of the Project such as but not limited to a structure an interchange a building a portion of a site a branch circuit in highway illumination that has been in satisfactory and continuous operation for a period of at least days or a section of road or pavement then to the extent that said portions stability and integrity are not dependent upon the completion of other Contract work the completed unit or portion of the Project may be opened to vehicular or pedestrian traffic under the provisions of .. or to railroad aircraft pedestrian or other traffic or to occupancy at the direction of the Engineer .
A final inspection of the substantiallycompleted unit or portion of the Project will be arranged by the Engineer .
Upon evidence of such completion including issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for any building and upon agreement by the Engineer the Contractor will be relieved of the responsibility for that work which was placed upon it by The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages to the completed unit or portion of the Project that may be caused by or that may result from the operations of the Contractor or its subcontractors or their employees and the Contractor shall take such precautions and shall provide such protection as may be necessary to avoid possible damage to said unit or portion of the Project .
The acceptance of the completed unit or portion shall in no way affect any other requirements governing the completion and acceptance of the Project as a whole .
.. Termination of the Contractors Responsibility The Contractors responsibility for nonadministrative Project work will be considered terminated when the final inspection has been held any required additional work and final cleaningup have been completed all final operation and maintenance manuals have been submitted and all of the Contractors equipment and construction signs have been removed from the .. Project site .

The tare weight of trucks used to haul materials being paid for by weight shall be taken at such times as the Engineer directs .
.. Value Engineering Change Proposal These Value Engineering Change Proposal VECP provisions apply as encouragement to the Contractor to initiate develop and present to the Department for consideration cost or timereduction .. proposals or a combination of both conceived by the Contractor involving changes to the drawings designs specifications or other requirements of the Contract .
These provisions do not apply unless the proposal submitted is specifically identified by the Contractor as being presented for consideration as a VECP .
All such proposals must be made on the Departments VECP form copies of which are available from the Department .
The Department reserves the right to decline to review or to reject after initial review any VECP .
Before expending considerable funds in development of a formal VECP the Contractor shall submit a conceptual Proposal to the Department on Departmentprovided forms .
The proposals which may be considered as VECPs are those which if implemented a would require modification of the Contract by construction order b would produce a savings to the Department by calling for the use of items or methods less costly than those specified in the Contract c would not alter necessary standardized features of the original Project and d would not impair essential functions or characteristics of the construction called for by the original Contract such as service life reliability economy of operation and ease of maintenance .
Material substitution alone will not be considered as a VECP .
A VECP may shorten Contract time however acceleration alone will not be considered as a VECP .
Cautions and Conditions .
The Contractor is cautioned not to base any bid or bid price on the anticipated approval of a VECP and to recognize that such Proposal may be rejected .
The Contractor will be required to perform the Contract in accordance with the existing Contract plans and specifications at the prices bid unless and until the Department formally accepts in writing the Contractors VECP . .
In order for the Department to consider such a Proposal the savings likely to be generated by the Proposal must be sufficient in the sole judgment of the Department to warrant its review and processing by the Department .

The Proposal must be presented and approved in writing prior to the Contractors undertaking any work on the Contract items involved in the proposal .
Savings due to a reduction in quantities or deletion of items which result solely from adjustments to field conditions and Proposals which would only waive specification or other Contract requirements are not considered to be VECPs . .
The Contractor shall have no claim against the Department for any costs or delays due to the Departments review or rejection of a VECP including but not limited to development costs anticipated profits or increased material or labor costs resulting from delays in the review or rejection of such Proposal . .
The Department will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a Proposal and of the estimated net savings in construction costs that would result from adoption of all or any parts of such Proposal .
In determining such estimated net savings the Department reserves the right to disregard the Contract bid prices if in the judgment of the Engineer such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of work to be performed or deleted under the Proposal .
Errors in the estimated quantities in the bid proposal form for the Contract shall be corrected by the Department prior to calculating the savings that would likely result from adoption of the VECP . .
The Engineer may reject all or any portion of work performed pursuant to an approved VECP if the Engineer determines that unsatisfactory results are being obtained because of the Proposals implementation with regard to that work .
The Engineer may direct the removal of such rejected work and require the Contractor to proceed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
Where modifications of the VECP have been approved in order to adjust to field or other conditions payment will be limited to the total amount payable for the work at the Contract bid prices as if the pertinent work had been constructed in accordance with the original Contract requirements .
The Contractor waives the right to use such rejection or limitation of reimbursement as the basis of any claim against the State for delay damages or for any other damages or costs. . VECPs must meet the requirements of the specifications or standards of the Department .
The standards governing the original design of the Contract will be the minimal standard allowed . .

Any lump sum submission shall be accompanied by a schedule of payment values . .
The Contract prices for the revised Project work will be paid directly as accomplished .
In addition to such payment the Department will pay the Contractor under a separate item or a Value Engineering Incentive item of the total savings obtained by the State as a result of its implementation of the VECP .
An estimate of said savings is to be calculated by the Department within week prior to the Proposals acceptance by a estimating what it will cost the Department to carry out the Project as revised according to the VECP b estimating what it would have cost the Department to carry out the Project under the terms of the Contract as modified by any construction orders as of the time that the Department accepted the Proposal and c subtracting the sum estimated as per a from the sum estimated as per b .
When the implementation of the Proposal including all related construction has been completed the Department will calculate the actual savings that resulted from it .
The Department will then distribute half of the actual savings less any previous payments to the Contractor . .
The Contractors costs for development design submission and processing of the VECP are not eligible for reimbursement . .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor based on any cost savings not identified in the VECP prior to its acceptance . .
The cost savings from a VECP that is exclusively time reduction shall be calculated as the number of Contract days reduced multiplied by the amount of liquidated damages for day under the Contract .
.. Increased or Decreased Quantities Whenever the quantity of any item as given in both the bid proposal form and Contract is increased or decreased the Department will pay for such item at the Contract price on the basis of the actual quantity completed except as otherwise expressly authorized under the provisions of .. .. or .. Extra and CostPlus Work Extra work shall be performed only under the conditions and subject to the requirements outlined in Payment for extra work may be made on any unit price or lump sum price or other basis to which the Engineer and the Contractor agree in writing or the Engineer may order that the Contractor will be paid for the work on the costplus basis described in this Article .

The Department will also pay to the Contractor an amount equal to for overhead for profit of the total sums described in a through above .
No part of the salary or expenses of anyone connected with the Contractors forces above the grade of foreman who provides general supervision of Project work will be included in the above payment calculations except when the Contractors organization is entirely occupied with costplus work in which case the salary of a superintendent may be included in said labor item when the nature of the pertinent Project work is such that in the opinion of the Engineer a superintendent was required for that work .
The Engineer and the Contractor may agree in writing to the allowable rate of pay for such superintendent or the Engineer may make payment based on such rate as he deems reasonable The Engineer reserves the right to determine the number and type of personnel to be employed for the costplus Project work .
b Specialized Work When the Engineer directs the Contractor to perform specialized work requiring skills tools and equipment substantially unlike those ordinarily used by the Contractor or its authorized Project subcontractors the Department will pay the Contractor for the use of a specialist to perform the specialized work .
For such specialized services including materials incorporated into the Project the Department will pay the Contractor its actual costs plus additional compensation in accordance with subparagraph e below .
If so requested by the Engineer the Contractor shall obtain and submit to the Engineer prior to performing such specialized work a minimum of three price quotes for the work .
c Materials For all materials necessary for costplus Project work the Department will pay the Contractor its actual cost for such materials including delivery charges as shown by original receipted bills plus of the sum of said cost and charges .
In lieu of receipted bills for materials used for the Project but which were not specifically purchased for the Project but rather were taken from the Contractors stock the Contractor shall provide to the Engineer an affidavit certifying that such materials were not purchased for the Project that the materials were taken from the Contractors stock that the quantity claimed to have been used on the Project was actually so used and that the price claimed for the materials reflects their fair market value at the time of their use on the Project .
The Department will pay for costs of transporting the materials to the Project site in accordance with subparagraphs a and d hereof .
The Department will not reimburse the Contractor for any penalty or charge incurred by the Contractor due to the Contractors late or delayed payment for the pertinent materials .
d Equipment All equipment used for costplus Project work must in the judgment .. Rev .
January of the Engineer be in good working condition and suitable for its Project purpose and the Engineer reserves the right to determine the size and number of units of equipment to be used for such work .

Trucks will be classified by cubicyard capacity .
No percentage markup will be added for payment purposes to amounts charged by the Contractor based on equipment rental rates .
The Department will not pay rental rates for small tools needed to complete the cost plus Project work .
For payment purposes estimated operating costs per hour from the Rental Rate Blue Book will apply only to the actual time during which the equipment is actively being used to perform costplus Project work .
For equipment that is also being used for noncostplus Project work the Department will pay the applicable hourly rate only for the actual time that the equipment was assigned to costplus Project work .
The applicable period of assignment for each piece of equipment shall start when the equipment commences to be used for costplus Project work ordered by the Engineer and shall end at the time designated by the Engineer .
For equipment brought to the Site exclusively for costplus work the Department will reimburse the Contractor for loading and unloading costs and costs of transporting such equipment to and from the Project site provided however that payment for return transportation from the Site shall not exceed the cost of moving the equipment to the Site .
If such a piece of equipment is selfpropelled and is driven to the Site under its own power then the Department will pay only operating costs and labor costs for its transport to and from the Project site .
The Department will not however pay for any loading unloading and transportation costs if the equipment is used for any Project work on the Site other than costplus work .

With regard to Items refer to CFR Section .
Standardized Changed Condition Clauses Required FHWA Contract Specification .
Facilities Construction Determination of Contract Time Unless the Contract requires the Project completion by a specified date the number of calendar days allowed for the completion of the Project will be fixed by the Department will be stated in the Contract and will be known with any subsequent adjustments as the Contract time .
If at any time the Contractor submits a schedule showing completion of the work more than calendar days in advance of the Contract completion date the Department will issue a nocost construction order revising the allowable Contract time to that shown on the Contractors schedule .
When the Contract time is stated on a calendarday basis that time shall be the number of consecutive calendar days contained in the Contract period designated in the Contract INCLUDING the time period from each December through the following March .
The Contract time will begin to run on the date designated in the Engineers Notice to Proceed as the date for commencement of the Project and the time will be computed as herein provided on a consecutiveday basis including all Saturdays Sundays holidays and nonwork days .
The total elapsed time in calendar days computed as described above from the commencement date specified in the Engineers Notice to Proceed to the Substantial Completion date specified in the Engineers Notice of Substantial Completion shall be considered as the time used in the performance of the Contract work .
Suspension involving cessation of work on all items except minor construction not affected by or connected with the cause of suspension shall be considered as total suspension .
In case of a total suspension of the Project ordered by the Engineer not due to any fault of the Contractor the elapsed time during which the Project is suspended will not be charged against the Contract time .
Work of an emergency nature ordered by the Engineer for the convenience or safety of the public or the protection of the Project work if performed during a period of total suspension will not be charged against Contract Rev .
January time .
No such time allowance will be granted in case of partial suspension provided however that the Contractor may request and the Engineer may grant permission to perform specific limited operations during such a partial suspension in which case Contract time chargeable for those operations shall be negotiated and agreed to in writing before such operations may commence .
Facilities Construction Extension of Time The Contractor may present to the Engineer a request in writing for an extension of Contract time if the time necessary for completion of the Project has been increased due to extra or added work or delays resulting from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor except for weather or seasonal conditions unless extraordinary and catastrophic .
Such causes include but are not limited to natural catastrophes acts of the State in either its sovereign or contractual capacity acts of another contractor in the performance of a contract with the State the presence of utility facilities including railroads fires strikes floods or delays by suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or such suppliers .
The Contractors plea that insufficient Contract time was allowed under the Contract before commencement of the Project is not a valid reason for extending the Contract time .
Requests for an extension of time with adequate substantiation must be presented within calendar days from the event that is the basis of the request or from the first effect of such an event on the Project .
The Contractor will be responsible for providing all the documentation necessary to support the reasonableness of the additional time requested .
This shall include a Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis and accompanying narrative that includes the specific dates and number of days for which the extension is sought the basis or bases for the extension and the schedule analysis illustrated in a graphic representation of the schedule impacts such as a bar chart or other type of graphic schedule .
The critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
Such requests will be considered by the Engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
Requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the Contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the Contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the Project as to materials labor or equipment .
For all Project delays or time increases except as provided below additional Contract time is the sole remedy that the Contractor may have and such periods of additional Contract time shall be deemed NonCompensable Delays .
For delays caused by the State in its Contractual capacity the Contractor may in addition to a time extension request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay and such periods of extended Contract time may be deemed Compensable Delays .
The period of a compensable delay is limited as follows It may not include time more than days prior to the Engineers receiving written notice from the Contractor with adequate substantiation of its intent to claim damages for the delay and It may not include periods of delay for which the State was responsible but during which the Contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the State Rev .
January was not responsible .
Damages for periods of Project delay for which the State had sole responsibility shall be limited to the increased costs incurred by the Contractor which shall not include lost profits which the Contractor substantiates and which the Contractor shows were caused by such delays .
The Critical Path Method Schedule Analysis shall include at a minimum .
The manner in which the Contractor planned to construct the Project in terms of activities logical interrelationships of activities work sequences activity durations and calendars . .
The actual duration and sequences of the activities based on what actually occurred on the Project . .
The variances between the planned and actual performance of the work listed in a chronological and cumulative manner summing to the net total delay on the Project at the time of the request .
a .
The causes of the variances between the planned and actual performance of the work specifically allocating legal responsibility for each to either the Department or the Contractor .
b .
The effects of the variances in work sequences activity durations manpower and resources on the incurred costs of the affected party or parties. . An identification analysis of the causes of any concurrent delays on the Project . .
Statements as to whether the time extension days sought are compensable or noncompensable along with a specific statement of any compensation request in connection with the time extension .
Any request for a time extension that does not include a corresponding request for compensation will be assumed to be a request for a noncompensable time extension. . All associated analysis documents worksheets schedules and contemporaneous documents supporting the Critical Path Method Schedule Delay Analysis .
Facilities Construction Failure to Complete Work on Time Time is an essential element of the Contract .
Since the prosecution of the Project may obstruct traffic interfere with business and otherwise inconvenience the public it is important that the Project be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the Contract including engineering inspection and supervision will also be increased as the time for Project completion is lengthened .
Therefore for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the Contract time has expired the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the Contract shall be deducted from any money due to the Contractor .
Liquidated damages are not a penalty but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .
Liquidated damages as specified in the Contract shall be assessed against the Contractor per calendar day from that day until the date on which the Project is substantially completed .
The Engineer has the right to deduct the amount of the liquidated damages assessed against the Contractor from any estimated payment for work performed under the Contract or under any other State contract or from any other sums owed by the State to the Contractor or to claim and recover such sums by process of law .

Without such information the Department and the Office of the Attorney General may not be able to adequately determine what claims have merit or to what extent they have merit or what amounts of compensation may be warranted and supportable .
Moreover State officials involved in the analytic or negotiation process may not be able to properly substantiate and support the recommendations that they must make to their superiors including the Attorney General and sometimes the Governor in the course of a settlement process .
Facilities Construction Claim Compensation If the Contractor proves entitlement for damages payment shall be made in accordance with the following provisions a Compensable Items The liability of the Department for claims will be limited to the following specificallyidentified items of cost insofar as they have not otherwise been paid for by the Department for instance through payment for extra work which under includes overhead and profit and insofar as they were caused solely by the actions or omissions of the Department or its agents .
The Department will pay for direct labor expenses direct costs for materials and direct costs for active equipment use plus an additional ten percent of the total amount of such direct costs as payment for home office overhead and profit .
Compensable delayrelated costs The Department will pay for any additional field office overhead and idle equipment costs for each day of Project Critical Path delay or suspension caused solely by action or inaction of the department .
If the Critical Path delay or suspension period is less than calendar days the Department will pay an additional ten percent of the additional field office overhead costs as payment for home office overhead and profit .
For delays less than calendar days idle equipment will be paid at of the Rental Rate Blue Book rate .
For delays equal to or longer than calendar days the Department will pay a per diem rate calculated as six percent of the original total Contract amount divided by the original number of days of Contract time as payment for home office overhead and profit .
In paying for idle equipment equal to or longer than calendar days the Department will pay for actual equipment costs .
Actual equipment costs shall be based upon records kept in the normal course of business and in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles .

In fills where the top of the proposed pavement will be between and feet above an existing concrete pavement the concrete pavement shall be broken in such a manner that complete fractures are obtained .
Intact fragments undamaged after breaking shall not be larger than s.f .
When present pavement not in cut or fill is removed as called for on the plans or directed the area shall be backfilled with a suitable earth material which shall be free from admixture of subsoil refuse stumps roots rocks brush weeds and other material which will prevent the formation of a suitable seed bed .
Wherever portions of existing concrete pavement are to be removed such removals shall be made to neat lines .
The areas in which such concrete surfaces are to be removed will be delineated by the Engineer before such work is done .
Where no break or joint exists in the concrete pavement at the line of delineation a kerf at least inches but no more than inches deep shall be made in the concrete with an approved concrete cutting saw .
The concrete shall then be removed from within the delineated area exercising extreme care to avoid breakbacks beyond the kerf break or joint .

Large stones or fragments of reclaimed waste shall not be placed in nests but shall be distributed over the area and the interstices shall be filled with spalls finer fragments or earth to form a solid compact mass .
The entire area of each layer shall be leveled off by suitable grading equipment and shall be compacted as hereinafter specified .
In portions of embankments where piles are to be driven the Contractor shall not place any material which might interfere with pile driving operations .
The correction of any condition which interferes with the pile driving operations in embankments constructed under the contract shall be made by the Contractor at no cost to the State .
Rock fill or reclaimed waste containing fragments with their greatest dimension over inches shall not be placed above an elevation which is feet below the top of the embankment .
Particles with their greatest dimension over inches shall not be placed within inches of the elevation of the top of the prepared subbase unless otherwise specifically authorized .
Prior to the formation of any embankment the Contractor may submit a plan in a form acceptable to the Engineer for grading operations detailing the location of embankment material sources and points of deposit for the entire Project in order to qualify for .. payment for overhaul as hereinafter provided .
Failure to submit such a plan will be construed as a waiver of any and all rights to payment for overhaul. . Compaction The entire area of each layer of the embankment and the subgrade in the excavated areas shall be uniformly compacted to at least the required minimum density by use of compaction equipment consisting of rollers compactors or a combination thereof .
Earthmoving and other equipment not specifically manufactured for compaction purposes will not be considered as compaction equipment .
The dry density after compaction shall not be less than of the dry density for that soil when tested in accordance with AASHTO T Method D. Each layer of the embankment and the subgrade shall be compacted at optimum moisture content .
No subsequent layer shall be placed until the specified compaction is obtained for the previous layer . .
Stability If after full compliance with the requirements of these specifications with regard to excavation placement and compaction density requirements a stable embankment or subgrade has not been obtained the Contractor shall proceed to perform such corrective work as is necessary to produce a stable embankment or subgrade .
This work may include but not necessarily be limited to control of moisture to within limits suitable for obtaining the required stability blending with rock or granular material from any Project excavation or borrow or free draining material or any combination thereof removal and replacement with acceptably compacted material or a combination of these methods approved by the Engineer .
Any of the foregoing methods may be supplemented by suspending embankment operations and allowing the material to dry .
When embankments are constructed of material from Project excavation and the Engineer determines that the material properly compacted is not sufficiently stabilized the cost of corrective measures directed by the Engineer shall be paid for at applicable Contract unit prices or in the absence thereof as extra work .
If the corrective work on embankments constructed of Project excavation is necessary and requires departure from the plan for grading operations to obtain material at locations other than shown on the aforementioned plan which result in increased net costs to the Contractor such increased costs will be paid as extra work except that no payment will be made for overhaul for any corrective material for the first mile of increased hauling distance .

Cofferdams Cofferdams shall be carried to adequate depths and heights shall comply with .
and shall be safe and watertight as necessary for the proper performance of the work which must be done inside them .
Cofferdams shall be constructed so that the work can be safely carried to an elevation feet lower than the elevation shown on the plans for the bottom of the structure footing or if a granular fill foundation is shown on the plans to an elevation feet lower than the bottom of the granular fill foundation .
The interior dimensions of the cofferdams shall be sufficient for the unobstructed and satisfactory completion of all necessary substructure work such as pile driving form building inspection and pumping .
Cofferdams which become tilted or displaced prior to the completion of all work to be done within them shall be righted reset or enlarged as may be necessary to provide the clearance for the unobstructed performance of all necessary work and such corrections and adjustments of cofferdams shall be at the sole expense of the Contractor .
Cofferdams shall be completely dewatered as required to complete the work entirely in the dry except as specified below .
When conditions are encountered that render it impractical to dewater the cofferdam the Engineer may require the placing of underwater concrete of such dimensions as will be necessary to allow the Contractor to complete the substructure in the dry .
The placement of underwater concrete shall comply with Cofferdams must be constructed to protect uncured masonry and concrete against damage from a sudden rising of the water and prevent damage to structure foundations by erosion .
No part of the cofferdam which extends into the substructure may be left in place without written permission from the Engineer .
At least calendar days prior to the start of constructing or installing a cofferdam the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer detailed plans and computations of its proposed cofferdams prepared by a professional Engineer licensed in the State .
The furnishing of such plans and methods shall not serve to relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for the safety of the work and the successful completion of the Project .
The Contractors proposal must meet all requirements established in regulatory permits for the Project and must also meet the requirements of .. . Dewatering Pumping from the interior of any cofferdam shall be done in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of water moving through uncured masonry or concrete .
During the placement of concrete or masonry and for at least hours thereafter any pumping shall be done from a suitable sump located outside the horizontal limits and below the elevation of the work being placed or as directed by the Engineer .
The pumped water must be discharged in accordance with the requirements of .. Pumping to dewater a cofferdam shall not start until any underwater concrete has sufficiently set to withstand the hydrostatic pressure created by pumping . .
Removal of Cofferdams Unless the Engineer directs otherwise the Contractor shall remove all parts of the cofferdam after completion of the required work .
This shall .. be done in such a way as not to disturb or otherwise damage any permanent construction .
Sheet piling used in constructing the cofferdam may be left in place with the approval of the Engineer provided the piling is cut off at elevations approved in advance by the Engineer and the cut off portions are removed from the Site .
.. Method of Measurement Work under this item will be measured for payment by the number of linear feet of cofferdam designated numerically on the plans .
.. Basis of Payment Payment for this work will be made at the Contract unit price per linear foot for Cofferdam and Dewatering measured as described above which price shall include all costs of design materials equipment labor work and any related environmental controls used in dewatering operations which are required for the construction of cofferdams shown in the plans of any repair correction adjustment or reconstruction of such cofferdams required by the plans removal of obstructions pumping and dewatering removal of such cofferdams and related environmental controls used in dewatering operations .
If the Engineer requires the Contractor to construct an additional cofferdam not shown on the plans or to enlarge a cofferdam beyond the dimensions of same as designated on the plans or if the Engineer accepts the Contractors proposal to do so as being essential for the purposes of the Contract the Department will revise the Contract to indicate those changes and to designate the revised dimensions of cofferdam deemed necessary by the Engineer .
If the total number of linear feet of any given cofferdam as designated in the revised Contract is greater than the quantity as designated on the original Contract plans the Department will pay the Contractor for the revised quantity of such linear feet at the Contract unit price subject to the provisions of .. and To the extent that the Engineer allows the addition or enlargement of a cofferdam for the convenience or other benefit of the Contractor but does not deem that addition or enlargement essential for the performance of the Contract work the Department will make no additional payment for the cofferdam or portion of the cofferdam which the Engineer does not so deem essential .
The Department will not in any event pay the Contractor for fewer linear feet of a cofferdam than were designated on the original Contract plans unless the Department eliminates that cofferdam in its entirety from the Contract .
Even if however the Contractors plan for an additional cofferdam or enlargement of a cofferdam deemed essential by the Engineer includes a previouslyexisting structure in no case will a previouslyexisting natural or built structure such as an abutment or an embankment be measured for payment in calculating the revised number of linear feet of cofferdam on the Project .
Any common cofferdam wall required for staged construction will be measured for payment only once .
In no case will a given length or portion of cofferdam be measured for payment purposes more than once .

The equipment shall be furnished and maintained by the Contractor and will be operated by the Engineer in accordance with Department test methods .
The Contractor shall furnish paving equipment and employ methods that produce a riding surface having a Profile Index of inchesmile or less .
The profile will terminate feet from each pressure relief joint or existing pavement which is joined by the new pavement .
Pavement profiles will be taken feet from and parallel to each edge of pavement for pavement placed at a foot width or less .
When pavement is placed at a greater width than feet the profile will be taken feet from and parallel to each edge and at the approximate locations of each planned longitudinal joint .
Additional profiles may be .. taken only to define the limits of an out of tolerance surface variation .
During the initial paving operations either when starting up or after a long shut down period the pavement surface will be tested with the profilograph as soon as the concrete has cured sufficiently to allow testing .
Membrane curing damaged during the testing operation shall be repaired by the Contractor as directed by the Engineer .
The purpose of this initial testing is to aid the Contractor and the Engineer in evaluating the paving methods and equipment .
Once the initial pavement smoothness paving methods and paving equipment are acceptable to the Engineer the Contractor may proceed with the paving operation .
Subsequent to the aforementioned initial testing daily profiles of each days paving will be run as soon as possible preferably during the next working day following placement of the pavement .
A daily average Profile Index will be determined for each days paving .
A days paving is defined as a minimum of linear feet of fullwidth pavement placed in a single day .
If less than linear feet is paved the days production shall be grouped with the subsequent days production .
If an average Profile Index of inchesmile is exceeded in any daily paving operation the paving operation will be suspended and will not be allowed to resume until corrective action is taken by the Contractor .
In the event that paving operations are suspended as a result of the average Profile Index exceeding inchesmile subsequent paving operations will be tested in accordance with the initial paving testing procedures .
For the purpose of determining pavement sections where corrective work or pay adjustments will be necessary the pavement will be evaluated in .
mile sections .
Within each .
mile section all areas represented by high points with deviations in excess of .
inch per feet or less shall be removed by the Contractor with an approved grinding device or a device consisting of multiple saws .
The final texture of the concrete pavement shall be such that texture appearance and skid resistance are comparable to adjacent sections that do not require corrective work .

Deviations in excess of .
inch will be determined from the profilogram in accordance with Department Test Methods .
After removing all individual deviations in excess of .
inch per feet additional cutting shall be performed if necessary to reduce the Profile Index .
On those .
mile sections where corrections are necessary second profilograph runs will be performed to verify that corrections have produced an average Profile Index inchesmile or less .
If the initial average Profile Index is less than inchesmile only the areas in excess of .
inch deviations will be reprofiled for correction verification .
After removing all individual deviations in excess of .
inch as stated above additional correction shall be performed if necessary to reduce the average Profile Index to inchesmile or less .
All corrective work shall be completed prior to determinations of pavement thickness . .
Surface Test Straightedge and Corrections As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently the pavement surface except as specified herein above for mainline pavement shall be tested by the Contractor with an approved foot straightedge placed both transversely and longitudinally to the centerline at sufficient intervals to check the surface profile .
Areas showing high spots of more than inch exclusive of tining corrugations shall be marked by the Engineer and removed by the Contractor to an elevation where the area or spot will not show surface deviations in excess of inch .. when tested with a foot straightedge .
Correction of surface irregularities and resulting surface finish shall meet the requirements specified herein for mainline pavement .

The compressive strength specimens shall be cast and cured in the field in accordance with ASTM C. After proper curing these cylinders shall be transported to the Division of Materials Testing for strength evaluation .
F. OpeningtoTraffic Vehicular traffic shall be excluded from the pavement until sufficient curing has taken place .
The pavement shall be opened to traffic with the attainment of a compressive strength of psi .
Any damage to the pavement from traffic or any other causes occurring prior to acceptance of this Contract shall be repaired by the Contractor at its own expense .
In order to expedite the opening of a pavement or part thereof to traffic the Engineer may direct the Contractor to supply a concrete with a higher cement factor or to substitute TYPE III Portland Cement for the type being used .
The mix design for this concrete must be approved by the Engineer .
The State will only pay the extra cost per ton for the cement used .
If the Contractor wants to increase the early strength of the pavement in order to facilitate its plan for the paving sequence substitution of TYPE III Portland Cement or use of a concrete with a higher cement factor may be allowed .
The mix design for these types of concrete must be approved by the Engineer .
The extra costs for the cement used shall be borne by the Contractor .
.. Method of Measurement It is the intent of these specifications that the pavement shall be constructed strictly in accordance with the thickness and widths shown on the plans .
The State will not be liable for payment for any thickness and widths in excess of that required .

Pay Adjustment for Surface Smoothness Payment to the Contractor will be based on the average Profile Index per .
mile section according to the following table AVERAGE PROFILE INDEX CONTRACT UNIT PRICE ADJUSTMENT Inches per mile per .mile section Percentage of pavement unit bid price to over to over to over to over to over to over to over to over see below When the average Profile Index exceeds inchesmile per .
mile section but does not exceed inchesmile per .
mile section the Contractor may elect to accept a Contract unit price adjustment in lieu of reducing the average Profile Index .
The unit bid price adjustment will be computed using the designed thickness of Portland Cement pavement or as adjusted under This unit bid price adjustment will apply .. to the total area of the .
mile long section for the lane width represented by the profile usually feet wide .
No payment will be made for any pavement which has an average profile index in excess of inchesmile until corrective work has been completed by the Contractor and the pavement reprofiled to verify that the average Profile Index has been reduced to inchesmile or less .
