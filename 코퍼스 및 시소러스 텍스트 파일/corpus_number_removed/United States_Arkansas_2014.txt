A Contractor may not terminate a DBE firms subcontract or purchase order without the written approval of the Department .
The Contractor shall make good faith efforts to replace a DBE subcontractor with another DBE subcontractor if the original DBE subcontractor is unable or unwilling to perform successfully .
All substitutions of DBE subcontractors during Contract performance must be approved by the Department in writing not only because it is routinely required but also to ensure that DBE firms are provided reasonable opportunities to perform on contracts and substitute firms are eligible DBEs .
A substitute DBE or the Contractor will not be allowed to commence work on those items committed or subcontracted to a DBE until satisfactory evidence of the original DBEs inability or unwillingness to perform is submitted to and approved by the Department in writing .
For projects with a DBE goal evidence of good faith efforts exerted by the Contractor must be submitted to and approved by the Department .
Good faith efforts to replace a DBE subcontractor shall be directed at finding another DBE to perform at least the same amount of work not necessarily the same work under the contract as the DBE that was terminated to the extent needed to meet the contract goal established for the project .
See also subsection .b .
Requirements of this Subsection shall also apply to DBE firms bidding as the Prime Contractor on a project .
In determining whether a DBE bidder has met a contract goal the work that the DBE performs with its own forces as well as the work performed by DBE subcontractors and suppliers will count toward the goal .
DBE bidders must list on the DBE Participation Form all work to be performed with its own forces and work to be performed by DBE subcontractors DBE suppliers DBE manufacturers andor DBE nonconstruction services that will be utilized in achieving the goal .
Agreements between a bidder and a DBE in which the DBE promises not to provide subcontracting quotations to other bidders are prohibited .
The successful bidder shall designate a liaison officer who will administer the Contractors DBE program and maintain in the home office the records and results of the contacts made with DBE subcontractors .
Contractors are encouraged to investigate the full extent of services offered by banks owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals .
e Eligibility of DBEs .
To ensure that the Departments DBE program benefits only those firms for whom it is intended the Department will certify or ascertain the eligibility of DBEs and joint ventures any of which are proposed to be used by contractors to perform subcontract work .
Certification by the Department will be accomplished through the use of Schedules A B and C. Certification will be granted for specific types of work for which the socially and economically disadvantaged owners have the ability to control the firm .
Eligibility of firms certified by the Small Business Administration under Section a of the Small Business Act or small and disadvantaged business SDB programs will be considered on a casebycase basis by the Department .
Contractors are encouraged to solicit DBE subcontractors wherever they may be located and if the DBE is not certified by the Department to encourage the DBE to submit certification forms for approval .
Early submission of certification forms is encouraged particularly for those complex situations in which a determination of eligibility may require extensive documentation and review .
A Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Directory is published maintained and available from the Department .
Firms listed in the Directory are certified at the date the Directory is printed .
Additions or deletions to the Directory after that date due to certifications decertifications etc .
are possible .
The current status of firms can be ascertained by contacting the Departments DBE Program Specialist .
f Determination of DBE Participation .
DBE participation shall be counted toward meeting the DBE goal according to the following When a DBE participates in a contract only the value of the work actually performed by the DBE for which it is certified is counted toward a DBE goal .
a .
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the DBEs own forces for which it is certified is counted toward a goal .
The cost of supplies and materials obtained by the DBE for the work of that portion of the contract including supplies purchased or equipment leased by the DBE except supplies and equipment the DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the Contractor or its affiliates is included .
DBEs bidding as prime contractors must indicate all work the firm will be performing with its own forces on the DBE Participation form .
b .
When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of its contract to another firm the value of the subcontracted work may be counted toward DBE goals only if the DBEs subcontractor is a DBE and is certified for the types of work .
Work that a DBE subcontracts to a nonDBE firm does not count toward DBE goals .
c. No credit will be given toward the DBE goal for any subcontracting arrangement that is contrived to artificially inflate or obtain the appearance of DBE participation .
Of particular concern is the interjection of DBE middlemen or passive conduits that are inconsistent with standard industry practices or which serve no commercially useful function and arrangements in which a DBE subcontractor is acting essentially as a broker e.g .
DBE secondtier subcontracts between DBE subcontractors who are fulfilling project goals and nonDBE subcontractors with contracts acknowledged by the Department on the same project .
Regardless of whether an arrangement between the Contractor and a DBE represents standard industry practice where such an arrangement erodes the ownership control or independence of the DBE or does not meet the commercially useful function requirement the Contractor shall receive no credit toward the DBE goal .
d. The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a DBE firm for providing a bona fide service such as professional technical consultant or managerial services or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract may be counted toward DBE goals provided the fee is determined to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services .
When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the clearly defined portion of the work that the DBE performs with its own forces may be counted toward the goal .
The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal only expenditures to DBEs that perform a commercially useful function in the work of a contract .
A DBE is considered to perform a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing managing and supervising the work involved .
To determine whether a DBE is performing a commercially useful function the Department shall evaluate the amount of work subcontracted industry practices whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work and other relevant factors .
A commercially useful function is performed when a .
All employees are under direct supervision of the DBE and on the DBEs payroll .
Use by a DBE of personnel from the Contractor or any subcontractor will not be permitted without prior approval by the Department .
b .
The DBE is responsible for obtaining all equipment necessary to perform Contract work .
The DBE shall negotiate and enter into equipment lease or purchase order agreements directly with the equipment source .
Such lease or purchase order agreements shall have prior approval by the Department .
c. The DBE is responsible with respect to materials and supplies for negotiating price determining quality and quantity ordering the material and installing where applicable and paying for the material itself .
If the Contractor chooses to assist a DBE firm by assuring payment for materials to be placed in the DBEs work or equipment leased by the DBE and wants to receive credit toward the DBE goal for the cost the following procedures may be used the material supplier or lessor may invoice the DBE firm and be paid by remittance from the DBE firm or the supplier or lessor may invoice the Contractor and DBE firm jointly and be paid by the Contractor and DBE firm utilizing a joint check from the Contractor .
Such a joint checking arrangement must be in writing either in the subcontract or a separate agreement and approved by the Department prior to the supplies or equipment being utilized and payment being made .
No credit will be given toward the DBE goal for the cost of the DBEs required materials or equipment that the Contractor pays directly to the material supplier or lessor .
d. A DBE subcontractor will be deemed to have performed a commercially useful function and the Contractor will be allowed DBE goal credit when a DBE subcontractor performs at least percent of its subcontract .
This work shall be performed by the DBE subcontractors normal work force .
The following factors will be used in determining whether a DBE trucking firm or owneroperator is performing a commercially useful function a .
The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for the items on its subcontract or purchase order including scheduling providing sufficient trucks to accomplish the haul and coordinating the work with the Contractor .
There can not be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals .
b .
The DBE must own and operate at least one fully licensed insured and operational truck used on the contract when work is in progress .
c. The DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services it provides on the contract using trucks it owns insures and operates using drivers it employs .
The DBE will also receive credit for the total dollar value of the transportation services attributable to no more than twice the number of trucks owned by the DBE and leased from another DBE firm .
Longterm lease arrangements are an acceptable form of ownership .
d. Lease Agreements .
There are two types of lease arrangements that can be utilized by DBE firms longterm leases and shortterm leases .
Longterm lease arrangements .
The DBE may lease trucks under a longterm lease arrangement from independent equipment leasing companies .
To be an independent equipment leasing company the company must lease equipment to the public .
A long term lease is defined as a twelve month or longer lease period .
The drivers fuel minor maintenance responsibility and full control of the leased trucks must rest solely with the DBE owner as stipulated in the lease agreement .
Drivers must be employees of the DBE subject to withholding workers compensation requirements unemployment etc .
Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE .
The DBE will receive full credit for the full value of the transportation services provided by trucks leased and operated in this manner .
A DBE supplier regular dealer must utilize this type of lease to supplement distribution equipment owned by the firm to receive credit for transportation services .
Shortterm lease arrangements .
a .
The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm including an owneroperator who is certified as a DBE .
The DBE who leases trucks from another DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services the lessee DBE provides on the contract .
b .
The DBE may also lease trucks from a nonDBE firm or owneroperator .
Credit for the total value of the nonDBE firm or owneroperator trucks transportation services will be credited to the DBE so long as the number of nonDBE firm or owner operator trucks does not exceed the number of trucks owned by the DBE or leased from other DBE firms .
For trucks leased by the DBE in excess of the total number of owned or leased DBE trucks the DBE is entitled to receive credit only for the fee or commission it receives as a result of the lease arrangements for the excess trucks .
All lease agreements must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use of and control over the truck .
This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease with the consent of the DBE so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck .
A copy of each lease agreement must be provided to and approved by the Resident Engineer before the truck begins hauling .
The agreement must reflect the name of the lessor cab card registration numbers of all leased trucks the description of the trucks the amount and terms of the lease and method of payment hour ton cubic yard or number of loads hauled and if owneroperator hisher Social Security Number .
e. The DBE must certify each estimate period the amounts paid to other DBE truckers nonDBE truckers and for hauls made with trucks owned by the firm .
This certification must be made on the form provided by the Department .
When a DBE is found not to be performing a commercially useful function the DBE may present evidence to rebut the finding .
Such evidence will be reviewed by the Department and a determination made .
Decisions on commercially useful function matters are subject to review by the Federal Highway Administration for projects receiving federal funds .
The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal percent of expenditures for materials and supplies required under a Contract and obtained from a DBE regular dealer and percent of such expenditures to a DBE manufacturer .
a .
For purposes of this Section a manufacturer is a firm that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces on the premises the materials supplies articles or equipment required under the contract for incorporation into the work and of the general character described by the specifications .
b .
For purposes of this Section a supplier or regular dealer is a firm that owns operates or maintains a store warehouse or other establishment in which the materials supplies articles or equipment of the general character described by the specifications and required under the contract for incorporation into the work are bought kept in stock and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of business .
To be a supplier the firm must be an established regular business that engages in as its principal business and under its own name the purchase and sale or lease of the products in question .
A trucking firm or owneroperator will not be considered a supplier nor will a supplier be considered a trucking firm .
A regular dealer in such bulk items as steel cement gravel or stone must own or lease and operate a pit quarry concrete plant or other such facility that sells materials to the public .
A person may be a regular dealer in petroleum products or asphalt binder without owning operating or maintaining a place of business where these items are bought kept in stock and regularly sold to the public if the person both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products .
Any supplementing of regular dealers own distribution equipment shall be by a longterm lease agreement and not on an ad hoc or contractbycontract basis .
c. Expenditures for lease of a particular piece or pieces of equipment from DBEs for exclusive use on the project for which DBE participation is to be claimed may be counted percent toward contract goals provided the DBE dealer actually has ownership or control of the equipment and is considered a regular dealer .
d. Capital expenditures for tools equipment vehicles field office furniture and similar property items even though such items are used on the project and purchased from DBEs are not creditable toward contract DBE goals .
e. Expenditures for materials and supplies obtained from DBE suppliers and manufacturers for use in the Contractors general operations which are not incorporated into the work are not creditable in whole or part toward contract goals even though a portion of such items may be used in the administration andor execution of a project .
Brokers manufacturers representatives packagers or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular dealers within the meaning of this section .
With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE which is neither a manufacturer nor regular dealer the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the procurement of the materials and supplies or fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site can be counted toward DBE goals provided the fees are determined to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services .
None of the cost of the materials and supplies themselves will count toward DBE goals .
In order for a firm to qualify as a DBE supplier of metal andor concrete pipe the firm must fabricate the pipe .
If material is purchased from a DBE supplier credit will be allowed at of the total cost of the material obtained from the DBE facility and the cost of delivery if the supplier is transporting the material using equipment it owns or leases on a longterm basis .
Credit for of transportation services provided by the DBE truckers will be allowed .
A valid purchase order for the material must be executed by the contractor and DBE and approved by the Department prior to the material being hauled from the facility .
The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal only those payments made to DBEs for work or services performed or material furnished after the DBE has been approved either on the list in the Contractors original participation submittal or later as a substitute .
The Department must have acknowledged a subcontract or purchase order prior to the beginning of work by the DBE firm .
Payments made to a DBE for work services or materials performed or furnished prior to approval and acknowledgment will not be counted toward the DBE goal .
g Subcontract Eligibility .
On FederalAid projects the provisions of Arkansas Act of concerning the listing of unlicensed subcontractors do not apply .
However the proposed DBE subcontractor shall meet all requirements of applicable Arkansas law including licensing prior to subcontract approval by the Department .
h Certificate of Payment to DBEsNonDBEs .
Certification of payments to DBE subcontractors suppliers manufacturers andor nonconstruction services must be submitted by the Contractor each estimate period utilizing the forms provided by the Resident Engineer .
A payment certification is also required when a nonDBE subcontractor subcontracts a portion of its work to a DBE firm or a DBE subcontractor subcontracts to another firm DBE or nonDBE .
In this case the subcontractor shall complete the proper form and submit it through the Contractor .
In lieu of using these forms contractors may submit a copy of subcontractor pay estimates provided the required information and certification are included .
This information will be submitted to the Resident Engineer for review and compilation .
Only those payments reported will be credited toward the DBE goal .
Failure to submit the reports within thirty calendar days after the end of the estimate period may result in contract sanctions including withholding of progress payments .
In addition a final certificate of payment to DBEs shall be submitted to the Resident Engineer who will attach it to the original copy of the final estimate for payment .
This requirement applies regardless of whether a DBE goal had been established for the project .
i Cooperation .
All participants in the Departments DBE program including but not limited to DBE firms and applicants for DBE certification and Contractors using DBE firms to meet contract goals are required to cooperate fully and promptly with U. S. Department of Transportation or Department compliance reviews certification reviews investigations and other requests for information .
Failure to do so shall be a ground for appropriate action against the party involved e.g .
with respect to DBE firms denial of certification or removal of eligibility andor suspension and debarment with respect to a Contractor using DBE firms to meet goals withholding of progress estimates findings of non responsibility for future contracts andor suspension and debarment .
j Intimidation and retaliation .
All participants in the DBE program including but not limited to the Department and contractors must not intimidate threaten coerce or discriminate against any individual or firm for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by CFR or because the individual or firm has made a complaint testified assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation proceeding or hearing .

Due regard shall be given to the location of detours and to the provisions for handling traffic .
No work shall be opened up to the prejudice or detriment of work already started .
The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on which work is in progress before work is started on any additional sections if the opening of such section is essential to public convenience . .
Character of Workers Methods and Equipment .
The Contractor shall at all times employ sufficient labor and equipment for prosecuting the several classes of work to full completion in the manner and time required by these specifications .
All workers shall have sufficient skill and experience to perform properly the work assigned to them .
Workers engaged in special work or skilled work shall have sufficient experience in such work and in the operation of the equipment required to perform all work properly and satisfactorily .
Any person employed by the Contractor or by any subcontractor who in the opinion of the Engineer does not perform work in a proper and skillful manner or is intemperate or disorderly shall at the written request of the Engineer be removed forthwith by the Contractor or subcontractor employing such person and shall not be employed again in any portion of the work without the approval of the Engineer .
Should the Contractor fail to remove such person or persons as required above or fail to furnish suitable and sufficient personnel for the proper prosecution of the work the Engineer may suspend the work by written notice and withhold moneys due until such orders are complied with .
All equipment that is proposed to be used on the work shall be of sufficient size and in such mechanical condition as to meet requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of work .
Equipment used on any portion of the project shall be such that no injury to the roadway adjacent property or other highways will result from its use .
When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor in accomplishing the construction are not prescribed in the Contract the Contractor is free to use any methods or equipment that are demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer as being capable of accomplishing the Contract work in conformity with the requirements of the Contract .
When the Contract specifies that the construction be performed by using certain methods andor equipment such methods andor equipment shall be used unless others are authorized by the Engineer .
If the Contractor desires to use a method or type of equipment other than those specified in the Contract authority from the Engineer to do so must be requested .
The request shall be in writing and shall include a full description of the methods and equipment proposed to be used and an explanation of the reasons for desiring to make the change .

If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the Engineer in writing for a period of time not originally anticipated customary or inherent to the construction industry and the Contractor believes that additional compensation andor contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for adjustment within ten business days of the receipt of the notice to resume work .
The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment .
Upon receipt the Engineer will evaluate the Contractors request .
If the Engineer agrees that the cost andor time required for the performance of the Contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor its suppliers or subcontractors at any approved tier and not caused by weather the Engineer will make an adjustment excluding profit and modify the Contract in writing accordingly .
The Engineer will notify the Contractor of a determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted .
No Contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed .
No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of the Contract . .
Determination of Time of Completion and Extension of Contract Time .
a General .
The time allowed for the completion of the work included in the Contract will be stated in the proposal and Contract and will be known as the Contract Time .
The contract time will be specified as a fixed completion date or as working days .
The Contractor shall provide sufficient materials equipment and labor to guarantee the completion of the project according to the plans and specifications within the contract time .
The Contractor shall advance the work so that the available time is appropriately utilized in order to complete the work within the contract time .
Unless an emergency is declared the Contractor shall not perform work that requires inspection on Sundays or legal holidays designated in Subsection .c and the actual holiday if it falls on a Saturday or Sunday .
If the Commission declares Friday following Thanksgiving Day as a Departmental holiday the Contractor shall not perform work that requires inspection .
No claim for an extension of time will be considered as a result of failure of the Engineer to furnish interpretations of the plans and specifications until calendar days after receipt of such demand in writing as required by Subsection .
and not then unless such request for an interpretation is reasonable and made in good faith .
The Engineer will determine the date upon which the Contract is substantially complete and time assessment will cease .
In the event cleanup is necessary or items found at the final inspection are to be corrected the Contractor shall complete this work in a timely manner or the Engineer will resume time charges .
b Fixed Completion Date .
When the contract time is specified as a fixed date it will be the date on which all work on the project shall be substantially complete .
The Contractor shall take into consideration all normal conditions considered unfavorable to the normal progress of the work and place a sufficient work force and equipment on the project to ensure completion of the work within the contract time .
Inaccessibility to a portion of the work due to utility conflict or utility work either of which prevents effective utilization of of normal forces and equipment for at least of the Contractors normal work hours will be considered as an adverse working condition for time exceeding that specified in the Contract for the utility adjustment .
c Working Days .
When the contract time is specified in working days time will be assessed for each day on which in the judgement of the Engineer and subject to the limitations below conditions allow the Contractor to effectively utilize of normal forces and equipment to prosecute the work required at that time for at least of the Contractors normal work hours regardless of whether the Contractor actually works .
The Engineer will not assess a working day when conditions exist beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor that prevent the utilization of forces and equipment as defined above .
Also for the purpose of assessment of working days inaccessibility to a portion of the work due to utility conflict or utility work either of which prevents utilization of forces and equipment as defined above will be considered as an adverse working condition for time exceeding that specified in the Contract for the utility adjustment .
The ability of vendors suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials andor services is considered within the Contractors control for the purpose of assessment of working days .
Should the Contractor prepare to begin work on any day on which inclement weather or the conditions resulting from the weather prevent the work from beginning at the usual starting time and the crew is dismissed as a result the Contractor will not be charged for a working day whether or not conditions change during the day and the rest of the day becomes suitable for construction operations .
Time from December through March inclusive will not be assessed against the contract time .
Saturdays and Department recognized holidays other than those designated above which may be declared by the Department for certain special or unusual circumstances will be optional to the Contractor as working days and time will not be assessed unless work is performed that requires inspection .
If work is performed contract time assessment will be based upon the same conditions as a normal working day .
Contract time will be assessed during a Partial Work Order period according to Subsection .b .
Contract time will not be assessed during a full suspension of the work as ordered by the Engineer .
During a partial suspension of the work as ordered by the Engineer the contract time will be assessed in direct proportion to the ratio of the money value of the items not suspended to the total contract amount .
At the end of each estimate period the Engineer will furnish the Contractor a written statement showing each working day charged during the preceding period and the total number of working days charged to date .
If the Contractor disagrees with the working days charged by the Engineer then the Contractor shall within calendar days after receipt of the statement give the Engineer written notice of such disagreement and the reasons therefor .
Subsequent handling of this dispute shall be according to Subsection ..
If the Contractor fails to protest the Engineers determination of working days charged within the calendar day period the Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the time charged for that period as correct and no subsequent request for review will be considered .
d Extension of Contract Time .
If the Contractor is unable to complete the work within the contract time as specified at any time prior to the final acceptance of the project a written request may be made to the Engineer for an extension of time .
This request must contain specific dates and the detailed circumstances relative to the time extension desired .
The Contractors contention that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for an extension of time .
All extensions of time except extensions due to overruns will be documented by Change Order .
Any extended time for completion shall be in full force and effect the same as though it were the original contract time .
An extension of time will be granted a .
On fixed completion date projects if the Work Order is not issued within calendar days after the execution of the Contract .
An extension of time will be given based on the number of days delayed beyond the calendar days .
b .
On fixed completion date projects for time elapsing between the effective dates of any order from the Engineer for a complete or partial suspension of the work when such suspension is due to no fault of the Contractor .
Days assessed during a partial suspension period will be determined by dividing the money value of the work performed during the partial suspension period by the money value of one day .
The money value of one day will be based on the ratio of the total contract amount to the number of calendar days from the date of the work order through the fixed calendar date stipulated in the Contract both dates inclusive .
c. On fixed completion date projects if the total dollar value of accumulated current estimates or the final estimate exclusive of incentives and disincentives exceeds the dollar value of the total contract bid the completion date will be extended by the number of calendar days obtained by multiplying the contract time as set forth in the Contract by that percentage that the dollar value of the estimate exceeds the dollar value of the total contract bid .
When this occurs the extension of time will be based upon the number of calendar days from the date of the work order through the fixed calendar date stipulated in the Contract both dates inclusive .
d. On jobs on which time is specified in working days the contract time will be increased in the same proportion that the total dollar value exclusive of incentives and disincentives exceeds the total contract bid .
An extension of time will be considered based upon documented evidence submitted by the Contractor if a .
The Contract requires the furnishing of critical materials and the Contractor experiences a delay in delivery because of Federal priorities for defense needs or because of nationwide shortages .
Additional contract time may be allowed in an amount equal to the actual lost time resulting from such delay .
To obtain additional contract time the Contractor shall document and file with the Engineer all evidence pertaining to the original agreement with the material supplier or manufacturer .
This evidence must indicate that delivery would be made at or before the time the materials would be needed in the normal sequence of construction operations for incorporation in the work .
In the event that no prior agreement has been made for furnishing a critical material and the Contractor is unable to locate a supplier or manufacturer that can deliver the material when needed the Engineer shall be advised of this situation in writing indicating the date that delivery will be made and the date of the original request for such material .
In either of these situations when work has progressed to the point that critical materials not delivered are delaying progress of the project the Contractor may make a written request to the Engineer for additional contract time .
b .
The work has been delayed by any act or omission of the Commission .
c. Preparatory work to be performed by the Owner or by others specified in the Contract has not been accomplished and the delay is not the fault of the Contractor .
d. Weather conditions or the condition of the ground or materials were significantly abnormal and these conditions significantly delayed the work .
For consideration of a time extension based on weather conditions the Contractor shall submit in writing documented evidence of the conditions that existed for the specific days requested .
The Engineer will verify the validity of the request .
e. Change Orders involve extra work and the time needed to complete this extra work would exceed the normal time extension as a result of overruns based on money value the completion date may be extended by Change Order to provide for this difference .
f. It is determined that anticipated time extensions due to overruns did not materialize due to underruns in other items .
g. The work was delayed because of conditions not described herein that were beyond the control and without fault of the Contractor. . Failure to Complete Work on Time .
Time is an essential element of the Contract and it is important that the work be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the Contract including engineering inspection and supervision will be increased as the time occupied in the work is lengthened .
Loss will accrue to the public due to delayed completion of the contemplated facility .
For each calendar day or working day as specified that work remains uncompleted after the contract time has expired the sum specified in the proposal and Contract will be deducted from any money due the Contractor not as a penalty but as liquidated damages .
Should the amount otherwise due the Contractor be less than the amount of such liquidated damages the Contractor and the Surety shall be liable to the Department for such deficiency .
Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part of it after the time fixed for its completion or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended will in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights under the Contract . .
Default and Termination of Contract .
The Engineer will give written notice of delay neglect or default to both the Contractor and the Surety if the Contractor a Fails to begin the work under the Contract within the time specified in the Work Order or b Fails to perform the work with sufficient workers equipment or materials to assure prompt completion of the work or c Performs the work negligently or unsuitably or neglects or refuses to remove materials or to perform anew such work as may be rejected as unacceptable or unsuitable or d Discontinues the prosecution of the work or e Fails to resume work that has been discontinued within calendar days after notice to do so or f Becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency or fails to provide a replacement bond within calendar days containing all the guarantees of the original bond if the Surety should be declared in default andor liquidation or g Fails to settle all valid claims for materials labor or supplies in an expedient manner or h Allows any final judgment to stand unsatisfied for a period of calendar days or i Makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or j Fails to refund any moneys due the Commission due to errors in determining pay quantities for estimates within calendar days or k Fails to appropriately cooperate with the Department the public or others associated with the work or to provide proper superintendence of the work or l Fails to comply with contract requirements or m Is a party to fraud or n For any other cause whatsoever fails to carry on the work in a manner acceptable to the Department .
If the Contractor or Surety within a period of calendar days after written notice from the Engineer does not proceed according to the notice the Commission will upon written notification from the Engineer of the facts relative to delay neglect or default and the Contractors failure to comply with the written notice have full power and authority without violating the Contract to take the prosecution of the work out of the hands of the Contractor .
The Commission may appropriate or use any or all materials and equipment associated with the project as may be suitable and acceptable and may enter into an agreement for the completion of the Contract according to the terms and provisions thereof or use such other methods as in the opinion of the Engineer will be required for the completion of the Contract .
All costs and charges incurred by the Commission due to any of the above will be deducted from any moneys due or which may become due the Contractor .
If such expense exceeds the sum that would have been payable under the Contract the Contractor and the Surety shall be liable and shall pay to the Commission the amount of such excess .
Such charges shall include but not be limited to the cost of completing a part or all of the work under the Contract for calculating and collecting any compensating taxes due under Ark .
Code Ann .
et seq .
and Ark .
Code Ann .
et seq .
formerly Act of and for the collection of any overpayments due the Commission .
The Department may by written order terminate the Contract or any portion thereof after determining that for reasons beyond either Department or Contractor control the Contractor is prevented from proceeding with or completing the work as originally contracted for and that termination would be in the public interest .
Reasons for termination may include but need not be necessarily limited to executive orders of the President relating to prosecution of war or national defense national emergency that creates a serious shortage of materials orders from duly constituted authorities relating to energy conservation and restraining orders or injunctions obtained by thirdparty citizen action resulting from national or local environmental protection laws or where the issuance of such order or injunction is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons or agencies other than the Contractor .
When contracts or any portions thereof are terminated before completion of all items of work in the Contract payment will be made for the actual number of units or items of work completed at the contract unit price or as mutually agreed for items of work partially completed or not started .
No claim for loss of anticipated profits will be considered .
Reimbursement for organization of the work when not other wise included in the Contract and moving equipment to and from the project will be considered where the volume of work completed is too small to compensate the Contractor for these expenses under the contract unit prices the intent being that an equitable settlement will be made with the Contractor .
Acceptable materials obtained by the Contractor for the work that have been inspected tested and accepted by the Engineer and that are not incorporated in the work may at the option of the Engineer be purchased from the Contractor at actual cost as shown by receipted bills and actual cost records at such points of delivery as may be designated by the Engineer .
Termination of a contract or a portion thereof shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibilities for the completed work nor shall it relieve the Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claims arising out of the work performed . .
Vacant . .
Suspension or Termination of Contract Because of Insufficient Appropriation of Funds .
When the construction of the project is being financed in whole or in part with funds provided by an agency or agencies of government other than the State of Arkansas and should such agency or agencies fail to appropriate and make available sufficient funds for the normal prosecution of the Contract the Commission reserves the right to delay issuance of the initial work order to the Contractor until sufficient funds have been made available suspend construction operations on the project after the Work Order has been issued until sufficient funds have been made available or terminate the Contract upon giving calendar days written notice to the Contractor .
If suspension of construction operations is ordered the requirements of Subsection .
as applicable shall govern .
If the Contract is terminated by the Commission the requirements of Subsection .
as applicable shall govern .
If it becomes necessary to suspend work because of insufficient funds additional time for completion will be allowed equal to the period during which work is necessarily so suspended .
In no case will additional compensation be allowed for such suspension of work except an equivalent extension of time for completion of the Contract . .
Termination of Contractors Responsibility .
The Contract will be considered complete when all work has been finished the final inspection made by the Engineer and the project accepted by the Department .
The Contractors responsibility shall then cease except as may be required by law or as set forth in the Surety bonds and insurance policies .

If straightening is necessary and approved by the Engineer it shall be accomplished by using methods that will not damage the metal .
Heat straightening of materials other than Grade may be accomplished by careful application of localized heat .
The temperature of the heated area shall not exceed F C. Heat straightening of Grade steel shall be accomplished only under rigidly controlled procedures .
Each application shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer and in no case shall the maximum temperature of the steel exceed F C. Materials shall not be artificially cooled except by forced air until after the metal has cooled to F C. Below F C the material may be cooled by forced air or mist but may not be submerged in liquid or sprayed with liquid. . Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders .
a Materials .
Steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum yield point greater than psi MPa shall not be heat curved .
b Type of Heating .
Beams and girders may be curved by either continuous or Vtype heating as approved by the Engineer .
For the continuous method a strip along the edge of the top and bottom flange shall be heated simultaneously .
The strip shall be of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
For the Vtype heating the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in truncated triangular or wedgeshaped areas having their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
The spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the required curvature and heating shall progress along the top and bottom flange at approximately the same rate .
For the Vtype heating the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface shall terminate just before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached .
To avoid unnecessary web distortion special care shall be taken when heating the inside flange surfaces so that heat is not applied directly to the web .
When the radius of curvature is m or more the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend to the juncture of the flange and web .
When the radius of curvature is less than m the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface shall extend past the web for a distance equal to of the flange width or mm whichever is less .
The truncated triangular pattern shall have an included angle of approximately but the base of the triangle shall not exceed mm .
Variations in the patterns prescribed above may be made with the approval of the Engineer .
For both types of heating the flange edges to be heated are those that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve .
Heating both inside and outside flange surfaces is only mandatory when the flange thickness is ¼ mm or greater in which case the two surfaces shall be heated concurrently .
The maximum temperature shall be as prescribed below .
c Temperature .
The heatcurving operation shall be conducted in such a manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed F C as measured by temperatureindicating crayons or other suitable means .
Beams and girders shall not be artificially cooled except as permitted in Subsection .. d Position for Heating .
The beam or girder may be heat curved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
When curved in the vertical position the member must be braced or supported in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heatcurving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
When curved in the horizontal position the beam or girder must be supported near its ends and at intermediate points if required to obtain a uniform curvature .
The bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the member must not exceed the usual allowable design stress .
When the member is positioned horizontally for heating intermediate safety catch blocks must be maintained at the mid length of the member within mm of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .
e Sequence of Operations .
The beam or girder shall be heat curved in the fabrication shop before it is painted .
The heat curving operation may be conducted either before or after all the required welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed .
However unless provisions are made for member shrinkage full depth connection plates and bearing stiffeners shall be located and attached after heat curving .
If longitudinal stiffeners are required they shall be heatcurved or oxygencut separately and then welded to the curved member .
When cover plates are to be attached to rolled beams they may be attached before heat curving if the total thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than ½ mm and the radius of curvature is greater than m. For other rolled beams with cover plates the beams must be heatcurved before the cover plates are attached .
Cover plates must be either heat curved or oxygencut separately then welded to the curved beam .
f Camber .
Beams and girders shall be cambered before heat curving as the heat curving process may tend to change the vertical camber present .
This effect will be most pronounced when the top and bottom flanges are of unequal widths on a given transverse cross section .
Subject to the approval of the Engineer moderate deviations from specified vertical camber may be corrected by a carefully supervised application of heat .
g Measurement of Curvature .
Horizontal curvature shall not be measured for final acceptance until all welding and heating operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature .
Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the beam or girder in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by other suitable means .
The sweep of horizontally curved welded girders or rolled beams shall be within the following tolerances For flange width less than mm Tolerance .
mm X total length in feet meters For flange width of mm or greater Tolerance .
mm X total length in feet meters .
Vertical Cambering of Beams and Girders .
Design camber of welded girders shall be cut in the web plates before girder assembly .
Allowance should be made for shrinkage due to cutting and welding .
Small amounts of heat may be used to correct minor differences from specified design camber .
Design camber shall be produced in rolled beams by mechanical methods andor controlled application of heat .
The size number shape and placement of heating patterns shall be such that distortion is minimal and that buckling is kept within the minimum standard rolling tolerances for outofflatness of beam webs .
Beams with severe web buckles from improper heat cambering will be rejected .
The vertical cambering operation shall be conducted in such a manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed F C as measured by indicating crayons or other suitable means .
Beams and girders shall not be artificially cooled except as permitted in Subsection .. Vertical camber will be measured for final acceptance to the nearest inch millimeter .
