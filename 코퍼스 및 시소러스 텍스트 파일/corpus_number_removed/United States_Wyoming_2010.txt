Active Voice and Imperative Mood The Wyoming Department of Transportation has rewritten this edition of Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction with an emphasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice someone acts on something .
For example The engineer will take a sample .
A similar sentence in the passive voiceA sample will be takenwould be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample .
This edition of Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative mood .
The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
In Standard Specifications the department is stating its requirements or directions for work to the contractor such statements have the same force as if they contained the word shall .
In an imperative sentence such as Pour the concrete the department is indicating that it requires the contractor to pour the concrete .
Before the award of a contract imperative statements are directed to the bidder .
After a contract has been awarded imperatives are directed to the contractor .
The department will identify parties other than the bidder or contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in Standard Specifications .
In phrasings where the responsible party has already been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so the department may use the passive voice. . Organization of Specifications .. General With the exception of Division General Provisions Division Materials and Section Electrical Devices the sections of Standard Specifications are written in a fivepart format .
Each section contains the following primary subsections XXX .
Description XXX .
Materials XXX .
Equipment XXX .
Construction XXX .
Measurement and Payment Definitions and Terms ..
The subsections contain varying numbers of titled subsubsections composed of higher and lower levels as in an outline .
For example the equipment portion of Section Plant Mix Pavements and Recycled Plant Mix Pavements includes the following .
Equipment .. Milling .. Crushing .. Mixing Plant General .
Cold feed control system . . . . Control unit .
. . Batch Plants Drum Plants .. Hauling Equipment ..
Hierarchy of Organization The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections .
In addition and as shown at Subsection .. Mixing Plant in the example many subsections begin with a lowerlevel subsection called General .
The requirements of General subsections apply to the associated samelevel subsections that follow .
For example the requirements of Subsection Mixing Plant General which includes requirements about cold feed control and control units apply to Subsections Batch Plants and Drum Plants .
They do not apply to the higherlevel Subsection .. Hauling Equipment .
..
Titles or Headings and References The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for convenience and do not bear on the meaning of the text .
Technical specifications and other documents referenced in the contract refers to the edition in effect at the time of award of the contract unless otherwise specified .
lower levels of Subsection .. Mixing Plant Definitions and Terms .. .
Measurement Units InchPound U.S .
Customary Versus International System SI or Metric Standard Specifications shows sizes and measurements in both inchpound U.S .
Customary and International SI or Metric System units .
Inchpound units appear first followed by a metric counterpart inside square brackets .
When reading Standard Specifications use the system of measurements used by the department for the bid items on its Proposal Form E. Do not mathematically convert the units from one system of measure to another the department does not intend its measurement values to be equivalent and does not consider values interchangeable. .
