• Payment adjustments will not apply to instances where the Consultant determines that the paver screed is “ dragging ” .
• If a segregated area is identified by the Contractor and repaired prior to inspection by the Consultant it will be classified as `` moderate '' for the purpose of determining payment adjustments .
• Payment adjustments will apply regardless of the year the pavement is placed and the year the pavement is inspected .
The total payment adjustment for segregation is determined as follows : • Each lane.km of the completed pavement will be inspected separately by the Consultant .
A '' lane '' includes the adjoining shoulder .
Measurement of lane.kms will be made in 1 kilometre ( or partial kilometre ) long segments , 1 lane wide as shown on the contract plan .
Acceleration and deceleration lanes and interchange ramps are considered separate lanes .
For each lane.km , the Consultant will determine the following : ( i ) the total number of slight segregated areas and ( ii ) the total number of moderate and severe segregated areas and ( iii ) the total length of centre-of-paver streak ( determined by adding each instance of streak that is in excess of 1 metre in length ) These values will be used for the `` segregation frequencies '' and `` length of centre-of-paver streak '' in Tables A , B & C as applicable , with the exception that for partial lane·kms , the segregation frequency for slight segregation will be calculated by dividing the actual number of Section 3 Specification 3.50 Asphalt Concrete Pavement ( EPS ) 31 AUGUST 2013 slight segregated areas by length of the segment assessed ( expressed in kilometres ) and rounding to the nearest whole number .
Table A , Payment Adjustment for Slight Segregation Segregation Frequency of Slight Areas ( per lane·km ) Payment Adjustment $ per lane·km 0 ( 1 ) 1 or 2 ( 2 ) Greater than 2 - ( number of areas - 2 ) x $ 100 Table B , Payment Adjustment for Moderate and Severe Segregation Segregation Frequency of Moderate and Severe Areas ( per lane·km ) Payment Adjustment $ per lane·km 0 ( 1 ) Greater than 0 - ( number of areas ) x $ 500 Table C , Payment Adjustment for Centre-of-Paver Streak Length of Centre-of-Paver Streak ( per lane·km ) Payment Adjustment $ per lane·km 1 metre or less ( 1 ) Greater than 1 metre - $ 1.50 per linear metre ( 1 ) Lane kilometres with no areas of segregation of any type or severity , or any centre-of-paver streaks will be assigned a bonus payment of $ 1,000 per lane.km .
For partial lane.kms the bonus will be pro-rated based upon the actual length of the segment assessed .
( 2 ) Lane kilometres with 1 or 2 areas of slight segregation , no moderate or severely segregated areas and no centre-of-paver streak will be assigned a bonus payment of $ 500 per lane.km .
For partial lane.kms the bonus will be pro-rated based upon the actual length of the segment assessed .
Notes : - Total payment adjustment per lane·km for segregation will be the sum of Tables A , B and C. - For partial lane kilometres , the payment adjustments for Table A will be prorated based upon the actual length of segment assessed .
- The maximum penalty adjustment for segregation shall be limited to $ 2,000 per lane·km .
For partial lane·kms , this adjustment will be prorated based upon the actual length of segment assessed .
3.50.7.2.3 Payment For Work That Had Been Rejected , But Was Made Acceptable When defects have been remedied in Lots or Sublots which had been rejected , payment for the original quantity of material in those Lots or Sublots will be made subject to unit price adjustments and penalty assessments determined as follows : ( i ) Penalty or bonus assessments will be made for smoothness as follows : Section 3 Specification 3.50 Asphalt Concrete Pavement ( EPS ) 32 AUGUST 2013 Penalty or bonus assessments for PrI will be the amounts shown in the applicable section of Table 3.50 C and will be based on Profilograph tests following any corrective action taken by the Contractor .
The penalty assessment for each bump or dip over 8 mm will be $ 300.00 for multi-lift pavements and $ 100.00 for single-lift or curb and gutter applications .
Penalty assessments for bumps and dips will be based on initial profilograph testing conducted by the Consultant .
Repairs carried out by the Contractor will not affect the penalty assessment for bumps and dips .
If bumps or dips are treated by the Contractor prior to Profilograph tests by the Consultant , such defects will be considered greater than 8 mm and will be assessed at the applicable penalty assessment rates .
( ii ) The unit price adjustment for Asphalt Content , Density and Gradation will be based on testing of the replacement or overlay material where applicable .
Where replacement or overlay material does not cover the entire Lot or Sublot , prior tests on the uncovered area will be averaged with new tests on the corrective work .
The unit price adjustment determined through re-testing of the corrective work will be applied to that quantity of material in the Lot or Sublot which was originally rejected , to determine payment .
No payment will be made for any material used to replace , repair or overlay rejected work and all corrective work shall be performed entirely at the Contractor 's expense .
3.50.7.3 Repair of Failed Areas in Existing Surfaces Repair of failed areas in existing surfaces as identified under Subsection 3.50.5.2 will be paid for at the Contract unit prices bid for the Work .
Unit price adjustment will not apply to material used to repair failed areas in existing surfaces .
3.50.7.4 Removal and Disposal of Fillet and Ramp Material The removal and disposal of fillet and/or ramp material will be considered incidental to the Work and will not be paid for separately .
3.50.7.5 Transverse Pavement Joints Constructing transverse pavement joints including any required cold-milling will be considered incidental to the Work and will not be paid for separately .
3.50.7.6 Preliminary Leveling Accepted material used for preliminary leveling will be measured and paid for at the unit price bid for Asphalt Concrete Pavement - EPS where applicable .
Unit Price Adjustments will not apply to material used for leveling .
No payment will be made for unacceptable material .
3.50.7.7 Asphalt Mix for Others Accepted additional asphalt concrete mixture will be measured in tonnes and paid for at the unit price bid for `` Asphalt Mix for Others '' .
Unit price adjustment will not apply to additional asphalt concrete received at the plant by other forces .
Section 3 Specification 3.50 Asphalt Concrete Pavement ( EPS ) 33 AUGUST 2013 3.50.7.8 Grooved Rumble Strips Measurement of shoulder grooving will be made parallel to the road centreline , to the nearest 0.001 km of through highway chainage for each side of the road where accepted grooving is performed .
Payment for shoulder grooving will be made at the unit price bid per kilometre for `` Grooved Rumble Strips '' .
This payment will be full compensation for all labour , equipment , tools , materials and incidentals necessary to complete the Work to the satisfaction of the Consultant .

• Segregated areas ( excluding centre-of-paver streaks ) separated by less than 3 m shall be considered a single area for the determination of payment adjustments .
For centre-of-paver streak , each area will be measured separately for payment adjustments .
• Payment adjustments for segregation will not apply to entrances or the portion of an intersection outside the through travel lanes and shoulders .
• If a segregated area is identified by the Contractor and repaired prior to inspection by the Consultant it will be classified as `` moderate '' for the purpose of determining payment adjustments .
• Payment adjustments will apply regardless of the year the pavement is placed and the year the pavement is inspected .
• Payment adjustments will not apply to instances where the Consultant determines that the paver screed is “ dragging ” .
The total payment adjustment for segregation is determined as follows : Section 3 Specification 3.53 Asphalt Concrete Pavement - Superpave AUGUST 2013 32 • Each lane.km of the completed pavement is inspected separately by the Consultant .
A '' lane '' includes the adjoining shoulder .
Measurement of lane.kms will be made in 1 kilometre ( or partial kilometre ) long segments , 1 lane wide as shown on the Contract Drawing .
Acceleration and deceleration lanes and interchange ramps are considered separate lanes .
For each lane.km , the Consultant will determine the following : ( i ) the total number of slight segregated areas and ( ii ) the total number of moderate and severe segregated areas and ( iii ) the total length of centre-of-paver streak ( determined by adding each instance of streak that is in excess of 1 m in length ) These values will be used for the `` segregation frequencies '' and `` length of centre-of-paver streak '' in Tables A , B & C as applicable , with the exception that for partial lane·kms , the segregation frequency for slight segregation will be calculated by dividing the actual number of slight segregated areas by length of the segment assessed ( expressed in kilometres ) and rounding to the nearest whole number .

TABLE 5.7.3 SAMPLING FREQUENCY FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE MATERIAL MINIMUM FREQUENCY ( 1 ) ( FOR EACH ASPHALT TYPE ) Asphalt Cement - all grades One per five Lots Liquid Asphalt ( ASBC ) One per day Prime , Tack , Curing Seal , and Fog Coat One for each 100 tonnes Seal Coats , Slurry Seals One per day ( 1 ) Minimum of one sample for each asphalt type or as listed above , whichever is greater .
5.7.4 ACCEPTANCE Asphalt materials supplied and incorporated into the Work will be considered for acceptance provided the specified quality assurance samples have been provided to the Consultant within the time frame specified and where both the Work and the asphalt material meet specifications .
In the event quality assurance test results are not available to the Consultant at the time he prepares the monthly progress payment estimates , the Consultant may request payment for Section 5 Specification 5.7 Supply of Asphalt AUGUST 2013 4 asphalt material which has not been accepted .
However , should the Contractor fail to supply the required samples or the asphalt material fails to meet the specification requirements , the Consultant may deduct such payments from the subsequent monthly progress payment estimates .
In the case where the Contract does not contain a bid item for the particular asphalt material , the deducted payment will be determined by the Consultant and will be equal to the estimated value of the asphalt material that fails to meet the specification requirements .
If , in the opinion of the Department , the failure to meet specification is significant enough to result in the probable unsatisfactory performance of the asphalt concrete pavement , the Contractor shall remove and replace all asphalt concrete pavement containing the rejected asphalt material .
Removal and replacement of rejected asphalt concrete pavement shall be at the Contractor ’ s expense , and no separate or additional payment will be made .
Asphalt materials which pass AASHTO M 320 specifications yet fail to meet the quality stipulations outlined in Subsection 5.7.2 , Materials , will be accepted ; however , products from approved suppliers with a history of frequent test results indicating non-compliance to these quality stipulations , as determined by the Department , will be removed from the Products list .
5.7.5 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT Where the Contract contains bid items for the supply of asphalt , measurement will be based on the Suppliers ' weigh bills however , the Consultant may check quantities delivered by weighing the delivery vehicles before and after unloading .
Where the Contract does not otherwise require the installation of a weigh scale for weighing materials , the Consultant will determine quantities by measuring the liquid level in the tank truck or storage tank , at his discretion .
When asphalt quantities are determined by this method , the Contractor shall calibrate the distributor trucks and storage tanks .
If there is a variance between quantities measured by the Consultant and the Suppliers ' weigh- bills , the Consultant will determine the quantity on which payment will be based .
Where the Contract contains bid items for the supply of asphalt , payment for accepted asphalt material will be made at the applicable unit price bid per tonne .
Where the Contract does not contain bid items for the supply of asphalt , accepted asphalt material will not be paid for separately .
Payment will be considered included in the unit price bid for the Contract item for which the asphalt material is used .
Payment will be full compensation for supplying asphalt material to the project ; storing the material ; sampling and quality control .
