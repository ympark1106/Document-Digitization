If the Department finds the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor , the Engineer may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify .
The Contractor 's claim that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time .
Allowance will not be made for delay or suspension of the work due to the fault of the Contractor .
Following the substantial completion of the project or the completion of all field work , if no substantial completion date is specified , the Engineer will furnish the Contractor a partially completed Contract Claim Form ( DOT-248 ) .

The Department will use the amount shown in the schedules per working day in all cases except when the contract time is specified on a calendar day count basis .
When the contract time is specified on a calendar day count basis , the Department will use the amount shown per calendar day .
The amount deducted will be considered not as a penalty but as liquidated damages due the Department from the Contractor by reason of added cost to the Department for contract administration resulting from the work not being completed within the required time .

Determination of Contract Unit Price Adjustment : Asphalt concrete that is not compacted according to the Specified Density Method will not be included in the pay factor calculations but may be price adjusted ( DOT-18 ) for failure to conform to specification requirements .
The material specified to be sampled and tested on a QC/QA basis will be evaluated for payment under this subsection .
All QC test results for a lot will be analyzed collectively and statistically by the Quality Level Analysis- Standard Deviation Method using the procedures herein defined .
The lots will be analyzed to determine the total estimated percent of the lot that is within the specification limits .
Quality Level Analysis ( specification conformance analysis ) is a statistical procedure for estimating the percent of material that is within the specification limits ( PWL ) .
The PWL is determined by using the lot mean , ( X ) and the lot standard deviation ( s ) .
Two measures of quality are required to establish the contract unit price adjustment .
The first measure is the Acceptable Quality Level ( AQL ) which is the PWL at which the lot will receive 100 % pay or a composite pay factor of 1.00 .
The second measure of quality is the Rejectable Quality Level ( RQL ) at which the Engineer has determined the material may not perform as desired and may be rejected .
The AQL has been selected at 90 PWL and the RQL at 60 PWL .
The RQL using the pay factor equation will result in 85 % pay or a pay factor of 0.85 .
An individual pay factor for any attribute resulting in less than 85 % pay may result in the lot being rejected .
When the Acceptable Quality Level of any individual pay factor attribute has a QL of 90 or less the composite pay factor shall not exceed 1.00 .
A lot may be accepted provided the composite pay factor is at least 0.85 and there are no isolated defects identified by the Engineer .
A lot containing material with less than a 0.85 composite pay factor may be rejected .
All of the rejected material shall be removed from the work .
The Engineer will determine if the material may remain in place at a reduced price .
A lot containing material with less than a 0.85 composite pay factor may not be overlaid prior to the Engineer determining the acceptability of the lot .
The Engineer may reject any quantity of material that appears to be defective based on visual inspection or test results .
The visual rejection may include segregation , low temperature material , very high or low asphalt content , etc .
Such rejected material 322 ASPHALT CONCRETE - CLASS Q ( New Section ) Page 160 shall not be used in the work or included with the lot acceptance tests .
Rejected material will not be measured for payment .
The Contractor may elect to remove any defective material and replace it with new material to avoid a pay factor less than 1.00 .
Any such new material will be sampled , tested , and evaluated for acceptance according to this specification .

Quality Level Analysis : The standard deviation method procedures are as follows : a .
Only test results on material incorporated in the work will be included in the quality level analysis .
b .
Calculate the arithmetic mean ( X ) of the test values : Where : Σ = summation of x = individual test value to xn n = total number of test values c. Calculate the sample standard deviation ( s ) : Where : Σ ( x ) 2 = summation of the squares of individual test values .
( x ) 2 Σ = summation of the individual test values squared .
d. Calculate the upper quality index ( QU ) : Where : USL = upper specification limit or target value ( TV ) plus allowable deviation .
Target Value = the single specification value which would result in an ideal product .
e. Calculate the lower quality index ( QL ) : X = x n Σ S = n ( x ) - ( x ) n ( n -1 ) 2 2 ∑ ∑ U Q = USL - X s L Q = X - LSL s ASPHALT CONCRETE - CLASS Q ( New Section ) 322 Page 161 Where : LSL = lower specification limit or target value minus allowable deviation .
f. Determine PU ( percent within the upper specification limit which corresponds to a given QU ) from Table P. Note : If a USL is not specified , PU will be 100. g. Determine PL ( percent within the lower specification limit which corresponds to a given QL ) from Table P. Note : If an LSL is not specified , PL will be 100. h. Determine the Quality Level ( the total percent within specification limits ) .
Quality Level ( QL ) = ( PU + PL ) - 100 i .
To determine the pay factor for each individual attribute ( PF ) = 55 + 0.5 ( QL ) .
j .
Determine the Composite Pay Factor ( CPF ) for each lot .
The third decimal place of the CPF shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth by the computer program .
[ f1 ( PF1 ) + f2 ( PF2 ) ] CPF =__________________ ( 100 ) Σf f = 1 to 2 Where : f1 or 2 = price adjustment factor listed in Table O for each measured attribute .
PF1 or 2 = Pay Factor for each measured attribute .
Σf = Sum of the `` f '' ( price adjustment ) factors .
The asphalt concrete pavement contract unit price will be adjusted according to Section 322.4 .
Payment for the asphalt concrete will be made at a price determined by multiplying the contract unit price by the composite pay factor .

Connections Using High Strength Bolts : Girder splices and other structural joints utilizing high strength bolts in friction-type connections shall use direct tension indicators .
a .
Direct tension indicator protrusions shall bear against a hardened surface .
The direct tension indicators shall be capable of indicating the required bolt tension when the measured gap between the direct tension indicator and the surface against which the protrusions bear is reduced to that specified .
The direct tension indicator shall be specifically marked to identify the type of bolt for which it is to be used .
A different marking shall be used for ASTM A325 bolts than for ASTM A490 bolts .
Direct tension indicators shall be new and unused .
b. Bolt lengths shall be determined as shown in the following : Table 1 Bolt Length Bolt Size , Inches Add to Grip * 1 to Determine Bolt Length , Inches 5/8 7/8 3/4 1 7/8 1 1/8 1 1 1/4 * 1 Grip is thickness of material to be connected , exclusive of washers .
For each flat washer , add 1/8 inch to the grip .
For each bevel washer , add 5/16 inch to the grip .
For each direct tension indicator , add 3/16 inch to the grip .
Irregular lengths shall be adjusted to the next longer 1/4 inch increment .
c. Bolted parts shall fit solidly together when assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or other interposed compressible material .
STEEL STRUCTURES 410 Page 257 When assembled , all joint surfaces , including those adjacent to the bolt heads , nuts or washers shall be free of scale , burrs , dirt , other foreign material , and defects that would prevent solid seating of parts .
Tight mill scale does not apply .
In girder splices , bolted splices and other friction-type connections , all contact surfaces shall be free of oil , paint , lacquer , and other coatings , except as specified in Section 411.3 B.3 .
When weathering steel is specified or used , all faying surfaces of connections shall be blast cleaned to a near-white finish in accordance with SSPC SP10 immediately prior to assembling connections in the field .
d. All fasteners shall have a hardened washer under the element turned in tightening .
For installations utilizing ASTM A490 bolts where the steel work comprising the grip has a specified yield strength less than 40 ksi , special requirements for hardened washers will be noted on the contract .
When the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis , a smooth hardened beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack of parallelism .
In the normal installation , the direct tension indicator shall be placed on the bolt with the protrusions bearing against the underside of the bolt head .
For this type installation , the nut is the turned element and the hardened washer will be placed between the steelwork and the nut .
If required , due to bolt entering and wrench operation clearances , it will be permissible to use the bolt head as the turned element .
In this type installation , a hardened washer shall be placed under the bolt head and the direct tension indicator placed on the bolt with its protrusions bearing against the hardened washer .
In those installations , where inspection of the bolt head is too difficult , it will be permissible to place the direct tension indicator at the nut end .
The direct tension indicator shall be placed on the bolt with protrusions facing toward the nut .
A hardened washer is then placed on the bolt against the protrusions and the nut is installed .
With this type installation , the nut is the turned element .
The surface contacting the protrusions of a direct tension indicator shall not turn during the tightening operation .
For those type installations where the direct tension indicator is used adjacent to a hardened round washer , some slight movement of the hardened round washer is acceptable .
On bolt installations where beveled washers are used or galvanized bolts are specified or slotted or oversize holes are used , special requirements for hardened round washers and direct tension indicators must be observed , as provided in the contract .
410 STEEL STRUCTURES Page 258 e. All bolts in a joint shall be tightened to reduce the gap between the washer face of the bolt head and the face of the direct tension indicator .
If the direct tension indicator is installed nearest to the turned element , between the face of the direct tension indicator and the hardened round washer , the average gap shall conform to that specified in Section 410.3 G.5.b .
When the average gap is equal to or less than that specified in Section 410.3 G.5.b , the minimum required fastener tension shall be assumed satisfied , unless the Engineer determines additional verification is required .
A sufficient number of bolts shall first be placed in the joint and “ snugged ” to insure that all faying surfaces are in firm contact , prior to tightening .
Snug tight is defined as the tightness attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary wrench .
Bolts shall be placed in any remaining holes and snugged tight as erection bolts or pins are removed .
All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened progressing systematically from the center most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
When tightening , the element not turned shall be held with a hand wrench to prevent rotation .
The gap between the bolt head and the face of the direct tension indicator is reduced while tensioning due to the bolt clamping force , which flattens the washer protrusions .
When tightening , complete closure of the gap around the circumference should be avoided to prevent over tightening the bolt .
The gap may not be uniform around the circumference of the direct tension indicator as the wrench may pull the bolt off center in the hole , resulting in non-uniform compression of the protrusions .
When non-uniform gap exists , the average gap criteria is satisfied if the gap measured at several points around the circumference shows 50 % of the measurements to be equal to or less than the value specified in Section 410.3 G.5.b .
If there is no gap at only one point on the circumference , the bolt is properly tightened and no further tightening shall be attempted .
Impact wrenches shall be of adequate capacity to perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately 10 seconds .
ASTM A490 bolts shall be tightened with an electric or hydraulic wrench .
The Contractor shall check the gap on all bolts to assure that the completed joint meets the requirements of this specification .
A metal feeler gauge capable of probing between adjacent protrusions of the direct tension indicator shall be supplied by the Contractor .
The Contractor shall supply the Engineer with an identical gauge for inspection .
After all bolts in a joint have been tightened , the Contractor shall return to the first bolts tightened to assure that they have not loosened .
Lost tension may be restored by tightening so that the gap is slightly less than originally measured .
STEEL STRUCTURES 410 Page 259 f. In order to determine acceptability of direct tension indicators the Engineer shall : 1 ) Sample and test the direct tension indicators in accordance with SD 503 .
The cost for the bolts and direct tension indicators used for field verification shall be incidental to the cost for the structural steel .
2 ) Have full opportunity to witness installation of bolted connections and shall periodically observe the installation and tightening operation to ensure that proper procedures are being adhered to .
3 ) Determine that all bolts have been tightened upon completion of a bolted joint .
A minimum of 20 % , but not less than four bolts in each joint , shall be inspected with a metal feeler gauge .
If all gaps checked are within the allowable distance described , the joint shall be accepted as properly tightened .
If gaps checked are in excess of that specified , the Contractor shall reinspect and retighten each bolt in the joint , as required , and resubmit the joint for inspection .
The metal feeler gauge shall be used as a “ no go ” inspection tool by inserting the tapered nose of the gauge into the openings between protrusions .
If the gauge does not reach the shaft of the bolt , but a gap is evident , the installation is acceptable .
g. The turn-of-nut method for bolt tightening may be used when specified in the plans .
When the turn-of-nut installation method is specified , hardened washers are not required except as specified in Section 410.3 G.6.d .
A sufficient number of bolts shall first be placed in the joint and snugged to insure that all faying surfaces are in firm contact , prior to tightening .
Snug tight is defined as the tightness attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary wrench .
Bolts shall be placed in any remaining holes and snugged tight as erection bolts or pins are removed .
All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened the amount shown in Table 2 progressing systematically from the center most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
When tightening , the element not turned shall be held with a hand wrench to prevent rotation .

For bolts installed by 1/2 turn and less , the tolerance is plus or minus 30 degrees ; for bolts installed by 2/3 turn and more , the tolerance is plus or minus 45 degrees .
* 2 Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel .
* 3 No research work has been performed by the Research Council Riveted and Bolted Structural Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure when bolt lengths exceed 12 diameters .
Therefore , the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions .

For Double Action Steam or Air Hammers and Closed Cylinder Q ( drive ) = 10.5E X W_ Top Diesel Hammers : S+0.1 W+M c. For Single Action Steam or Air Hammers and Open Cylinder Q ( drive ) = 10.5WH X W_ Top Diesel Hammers : S+0.1 W+M The following applies to these formulas : Q = the nominal pile bearing resistance in tons .
W = the weight of a gravity hammer , or the ram of an energy hammer in tons .
H = the height of free fall of the hammer or ram in feet .
510 TIMBER , PRESTRESSED , AND STEEL PILES Page 370 M = the weight in tons of the driven mass and shall include the weight of the pile , the weight of the driving cap and the weight of the anvil , if used .
E = the energy per blow in foot-tons .
S = the average penetration in inches of the pile per blow for the last five blows for gravity hammers and the last 10 blows for energy hammers .
3 .
The formulas shall be applied for compliance with the following conditions : a .
Unless the hammer has free fall , the value substituted for `` W '' shall be less than the weight of the hammer by an amount sufficient to compensate for all friction and drag tending to retard its fall .
b .
The head of the pile shall be free from broomed or crushed fibers .
c. The penetration of the pile is at a reasonably quick and uniform rate .
d. There is no excessive bounce to the hammer after the blow .
e. The value of `` H '' shall be less than the height of fall of the hammer by twice the height of the bounce .
f. For the computation of the bearing value for battered piles , the value obtained from the formulas shall be multiplied by the following factor : ( Cosine a ) minus ( f sine a ) .
Where `` a '' equals the angle which the leads make with the vertical and `` f '' equals the coefficient of friction between the hammer or ram and the surface on which it slides .
For gravity hammers sliding on greased steel surfaced leads or energy hammers , the value of `` f '' shall be assumed to be 0.1 .
4 .
When the required bearing for a pile , other than a test pile , can not be obtained without splicing , driving shall be stopped when the top of the pile is approximately 2 feet above cut-off elevation .
After a minimum delay of 24 hours , the driving may be resumed and the bearing rechecked to determine the amount of setting-up effect .
The amount of setting-up effect may be considered in determining the bearing value for the remainder of the piles , in the same bent or abutment , that can not be driven to bearing without splicing , provided they have an initial bearing equal to or greater than the pile checked .
E. Test Piles : The Contractor shall drive test pile of the lengths shown on the plans and at locations directed .
