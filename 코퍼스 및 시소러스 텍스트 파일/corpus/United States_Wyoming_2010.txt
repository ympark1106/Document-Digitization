......................................................................... 854 INDEX .............................................................................................. 855 DIVISION 100 General Provisions 2 SECTION 101 Definitions and Terms 101.1 Active Voice and Imperative Mood The Wyoming Department of Transportation has rewritten this edition of Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction with an emphasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice , someone acts on something .
For example : “ The engineer will take a sample. ” A similar sentence in the passive voice— “ A sample will be taken ” —would be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample .
This edition of Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative mood .
The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
In Standard Specifications , the department is stating its requirements or directions for work to the contractor ; such statements have the same force as if they contained the word “ shall. ” In an imperative sentence such as , “ Pour the concrete , ” the department is indicating that it requires the contractor to pour the concrete .
Before the award of a contract , imperative statements are directed to the bidder .
After a contract has been awarded , imperatives are directed to the contractor .
The department will identify parties other than the bidder or contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in Standard Specifications .
In phrasings where the responsible party has already been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so , the department may use the passive voice .
101.2 Organization of Specifications 101.2.1 General With the exception of Division 100 , General Provisions , Division 800 , Materials , and Section 701 , Electrical Devices , the sections of Standard Specifications are written in a five-part format .
Each section contains the following primary subsections : XXX.1 Description XXX.2 Materials XXX.3 Equipment XXX.4 Construction XXX.5 Measurement and Payment 1 2 3 1 Definitions and Terms 101.2.1 3 The subsections contain varying numbers of titled sub-subsections composed of higher and lower levels , as in an outline .
For example , the equipment portion of Section 401 , Plant Mix Pavements and Recycled Plant Mix Pavements , includes the following : 401.3 Equipment 401.3.1 Milling 401.3.2 Crushing 401.3.3 Mixing Plant 401.3.3.1 General 1 .
Cold feed control system .
. . 2 .
Control unit .
. . 401.3.3.2 Batch Plants 401.3.3.3 Drum Plants 401.3.4 Hauling Equipment 101.2.2 Hierarchy of Organization The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections .
In addition , and as shown at Subsection 401.3.3 , Mixing Plant , in the example , many subsections begin with a lower-level subsection called “ General. ” The requirements of “ General ” subsections apply to the associated same-level subsections that follow .
For example , the requirements of Subsection 401.3.3.1 , Mixing Plant , General , ( which includes requirements about cold feed control and control units ) , apply to Subsections 401.3.3.2 , Batch Plants , and 401.3.3.3 , Drum Plants .
They do not apply to the higher-level Subsection 401.3.4 , Hauling Equipment .
101.2.3 Titles ( or Headings ) and References The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for convenience and do not bear on the meaning of the text .
Technical specifications and other documents referenced in the contract refers to the edition in effect at the time of award of the contract , unless otherwise specified .
lower levels of Subsection 401.3.3 , Mixing Plant 2 1 1 2 Definitions and Terms 101.2.3 4 101.3 Measurement Units : Inch-Pound ( U.S .
Customary ) Versus International System ( SI or Metric ) Standard Specifications shows sizes and measurements in both inch-pound ( U.S .
Customary ) and International ( SI or Metric ) System units .
Inch-pound units appear first , followed by a metric counterpart inside square brackets “ [ ] . ” When reading Standard Specifications , use the system of measurements used by the department for the bid items on its “ Proposal ” ( Form E-91 ) .
Do not mathematically convert the units from one system of measure to another ; the department does not intend its measurement values to be equivalent and does not consider values interchangeable .

The engineer will not make an extension to partial or contract completion dates for nonexcusable delays .
108.6.4 Concurrent Delays Concurrent delays are delays occurring at the same time to separate critical activities .
When concurrent delays occur , the department will give precedence to nonexcusable over excusable delays in determining extensions to the contract completion date .
108.6.5 Working Day Extensions for Increased Quantities Upon written request from the contractor , the department will allow extensions for increased quantities when final quantities are determined , as shown on the cost summary report generated by the “ Monthly Progress Estimate ” ( Form E-125 ) .
The department will base the extension on the ratio of the original contract amount to the total cost of the work performed , computed as follows : 1 1 1 100 Where : TE = is the time extension in working days .
OT = is the original contract time and does not include time added by “ Contract Amendment ” ( Form E-61 ) or the months of December , January , February , and March .
1.46 = is the factor for converting calendar days to working days .
TC = is the total cost of the work performed , including cost increases resulting from “ Contract Amendments ” ( Form E-61 ) for which an extension was not previously allowed , and excluding costs associated with liquidated damages , incentive/disincentive or bonus payments , and costs for “ Contract Amendments ” for which additional time has already been allowed .
CA = is the original contract amount .
To determine a revised completion date , the department will add the working days indicated by the formula to the original contract completion date .
108.6.6 Working Day Extensions for Adverse Weather For whole or partial months within the contract time , Table 108.6.6-1 , Adverse Weather Days Expected , shows the number of working days included in anticipation of weather that will preclude work .
On the Monthly Report , the engineer will show for each month , and for the project to date , the number of actual adverse weather days determined by the engineer and the amount by which this exceeds the number expected .
The engineer may extend the completion date if the actual number of adverse weather days exceeds the expected number and the contractor has pursued the work diligently during the month .

Quality level analysis is a method of analyzing aggregate gradation test results to determine compliance with the contract requirements .
The quality level analysis will include an evaluation for outlier test results using the department ’ s computer software .
The engineer will determine the quality level , acceptance , and pay factor for each lot .
Lot and sublot sizes are specified in the respective technical sections .
The engineer will include partial lots with less than three samples with the previous lot for quality level analysis .
All test results for a lot will be analyzed to determine the pay factor for the lot .
The lowest pay factor computed for any one sieve will be used to adjust the pay for that lot .
Acceptance procedures will not apply to sieve designations with requirements of 100 percent passing , 97 to 100 percent passing , and 95 to 100 percent passing .
Only the PL ( percent within lower limits ) will be calculated for the sieve designations requiring 90 to 100 percent passing , and the PU ( percent within upper limits ) will be set at 100 .
The maximum obtainable pay factor will be 1.05 .
A lot containing material that does not meet the contract requirements will be : 1 .
Accepted if the pay factor is at least 0.75 or 2 .
Rejected if the material fails to obtain at least a 0.75 pay factor .
To avoid a pay factor less than 1.00 , the contractor may remove defective material and replace it with new material , which the department will sample , test , and evaluate in accordance with this specification .
Without testing , the engineer may isolate and reject material that is obviously defective .
Do not continue producing material that does not meet contract requirements .
If two consecutive lots have a pay factor less than 1.00 , change procedures to meet the requirements .
6 5 4 3 2 1 136 113.1 Acceptance 7 The engineer will compute the quality level analysis and pay factor as follows : 1 .
Determine the arithmetic mean ,  .
Where :  = summation x = individual test value n = total number test values  = 2 .
Compute the sample standard deviation , s. s = 3 .
Compute the upper quality index , QU .
QU = Where : SLU = upper specification limit or target value of job mix plus allowable deviation .
target value for QU = the single specification value with allowable deviations .
4 .
Compute the lower quality index , QL .
QL = Where : SLL = lower specification limit or target minus allowable deviation .
1 n - 1 n  i = 1 ( xi -  ) 2  SLU -  s  - SLL s  n x 137 113.1 Acceptance 5 .
Determine PU ( the percent within the upper specification limit corresponding to a given QU ) from Table 113.1-1 , Quality Level Analysis by the Standard Deviation Method .
If an SLU is not specified or if the upper specification limit for the sieve being evaluated is 100 percent , PU is 100 .
6 .
Determine PL ( the percent within lower specification limit corresponding to a given QL ) from Table 113.1-1 , Quality Level Analysis by the Standard Deviation Method .
If an SLL is not specified , PL will be100 .
7 .
Determine the quality level ( the total percent within the specification limits ) .
quality level = ( PU + PL )  100 8 .
Using the quality level from the preceding step , determine the pay factor from Table 113.1-2 , Pay Factors .
To obtain a given pay factor , meet or exceed the value in the table for the computed quality level .
Pay factors greater than 1.0 do not apply when quality incentives are not included in the respective technical specifications for a pay item .
Testing frequency indicates the minimum number of tests required for the specified quantity of aggregate produced .
For example , 1/1000 ton [ 1/1000 t ] is equivalent to one test minimum required for each 1000 ton [ 1000 t ] of aggregate produced .

513.4.12 Finishing Concrete Surfaces 513.4.12.1 Finish Types 1 .
Ordinary Finish .
Give formed concrete surfaces an ordinary surface finish immediately after form removal .
Finish horizontal surfaces while concrete is plastic .
Do not add water to concrete surfaces for finishing operations .
If approved by the engineer and applied in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s recommend ations , a commercial evaporation retardant may be used .
Remove fins and irregular projections from exposed surfaces .
Clean cavities and other defects thoroughly , saturate with water , and carefully point and true with a mortar of cement and fine aggregate mixed in the proportions of the concrete being finished .
Use mortar for pointing Structural Concrete 513.4.12.1 1 2 529 Structural Concrete 513.4.12.2.1 within 30 minutes of mixing .
Use commercial patching mixtures only when approved by the engineer .
Cure patches in accordance with Subsection 513.4.13 , Curing Concrete .
Tool construction and expansion joints in completed work , and free from mortar and concrete .
2 .
Rubbed Finish .
Keep concrete to receive a rubbed finish saturated with water .
Ensure the mortar used in pointing is set before wetting .
Rub surfaces with a medium-coarse carborundum stone faced with a small quantity of mortar composed of cement and fine sand mixed in proportions of the concrete being finished .
Rub until form marks , projections , and irregularities have been removed ; all voids are filled ; and a uniform surface is obtained .
Leave the paste produced by rubbing .
After placing concrete above the treated surface , obtain the final finish by rubbing with a fine carborundum stone and water until the entire surface is smooth and uniform in color .
After final rubbing , and when the surface is dry , rub with burlap to remove loose powder .
3 .
Float Finish .
Obtain a float finish for horizontal surfaces by placing an excess of material in the form and removing or striking off the excess with a template , forcing coarse aggregate below the mortar surface without creating a concave surface .
After striking-off , work and float the surface with a floating tool .
Do not use aluminum floats .
Before the finish sets , remove the surface cement film with a fine brush , leaving a fine-grained , smooth , sanded texture .
513.4.12.2 Finishing Bridge Decks 513.4.12.2.1 General Finish bridge decks with a deck finishing machine on rails .
Use hand tools only where necessary .
Set up finishing machines 24 hours before use to allow inspection by the engineer in daylight before each placement .
Before placing concrete , and under the engineer ’ s inspection , verify the adjustment and operation of deck finishing machines by moving the machine over the full length of the deck section and traversing the float completely across end bulkheads .
Check the specified cover over reinforcing steel and make necessary adjustments .
2 1 530 The engineer will randomly check the depth of fresh concrete immediately behind the screed and over reinforcing steel across the full width and length of the bridge deck .
If depth checks indicate variations greater than 2 in [ 12 mm ] , take corrective action immediately , which may involve additional tie downs for reinforcing steel or adjusting screed elevations .
Provide a working bridge behind the screed that can be used for depth checks .
Immediately after screed floating and while concrete is plastic , test the slab surface for irregularities using a 10-foot [ 3 m ] straightedge .
Hold the straightedge in successive positions parallel to the road centerline and in contact with the slab surface for the entire area of the slab .
Move the straightedge in stages of no more than half its length .
Correct variations immediately ; fill depressions with freshly-mixed concrete or strike off projections .
Consolidate and refinish corrected areas .
Repeat straightedge testing and refloating until the slab surface has no deviations greater than 3 in [ 6 mm ] .
After finishing the slab surface and allowing water sheen to evaporate , finish the concrete surface by dragging a seamless strip of damp burlap over the full width of the surface .
Use a drag consisting of burlap layers with sufficient length in contact with the concrete to slightly groove the surface .
Move the drag forward with a minimum bow of the lead edge .
Keep the drag damp , clean , and free of hardened concrete particles .
513.4.12.2.2 Tine Finish Immediately after the burlap drag finish , give the surface a transverse metal tine finish .
Control the method and application time of the finish to avoid tearing the surface and unseating aggregate particles .
Produce grooves in the concrete from c in [ 3 mm ] to 3/16 in [ 5 mm ] deep , at right angles to the roadway centerline on all bridges , regardless of skew .
Operate the metal tine device mechanically or manually , and do not overlap passes .
Other texturing equipment , such as a finned float , may be used if they produce equivalent grooves .
Leave the last 12 in [ 300 mm ] of deck next to the curbs untextured for drainage .
Use an edging tool at unarmored expansion joints .
As approved by the engineer , remove or correct concrete without a satisfactory finish at no additional cost to the department .

At no additional cost to the department , remove portions or all of the deck if corrective work is not satisfactory .
Protect concrete against damage until it obtains final set .
513.4.13 Curing Concrete If forms are removed in less than five calendar days , cure concrete immediately with water or impervious compound methods after removal of forms ; curing is not necessary if concrete is protected by metal or treated wooden forms for five calendar days or more .
Keep untreated wood forms moist during curing period .
When the weather would otherwise cause concrete mixing water to evaporate rapidly , apply a fine mist to concrete surfaces until curing is complete .
Alternatively , use a commercial evaporation retardant approved by the engineer and applied in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s recommendations .
When using the water method , keep concrete continuously damp for at least five calendar days by applying water with an atomizing nozzle that produces a fog mist ; do not direct water under pressure on the concrete or allow water to accumulate , causing concrete to flow or wash. Keep surfaces damp throughout curing , and use burlap or other covering approved by the engineer to retain moisture .
When using impervious curing compound , give surfaces the required surface finish before applying compound .
Apply curing compounds in accordance with Table 513.4.13-1 , Impervious Curing Compound Applications .
During finishing , protect concrete by the water curing method .
Mix compound thoroughly an hour or less before use , and apply uniformly .
Apply twice , each time at a rate of 1 gal per 300 ft² [ 1 L per 7 m² ] of surface area .
For concrete bridge decks and other exposed concrete , apply the first time immediately after the disappearance of free water from the surface .
For formed concrete , apply immediately after removing forms .
If the concrete surface is dry , spray with a fine water mist , and apply curing compound immediately after the disappearance of free water from the surface .
Apply compound the second time after the first application 1 2 1 2 3 4 532 has set and at right angles .
During curing , spray any uncovered surfaces with a fine water mist .
Protect the coating against marring for at least ten calendar days after application .
Recoat marred surfaces at the specified rate .
