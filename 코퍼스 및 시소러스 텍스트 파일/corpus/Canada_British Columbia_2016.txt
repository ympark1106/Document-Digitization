BC MoT 2016 101 ( 1 of 6 ) SECTION 101 QUALITY MANAGEMENT 101.01 General – All work on Ministry projects shall be undertaken through a total quality management process , utilizing Ministry , Contractor and third-party resources , as necessary .
The Ministry accepts the following definitions associated with Quality Management :  Quality Control ( QC ) : The process of checking specific product or service results to determine if they comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory product or service performance .
 Quality Assurance ( QA ) : The process of evaluating overall product or service , by persons or companies independent of those doing the Work , on a regular basis to provide confidence that the product or service satisfies the relevant quality standards .
The quality management program has two key components as follows :  Quality Control – the Contractor ’ s responsibility  Quality Assurance – the Ministry ’ s responsibility Each component of the program must address materials , processes , products , and documentation .
The Contractor shall provide unrestricted access to all Quality Control operations and documentation produced by or on behalf of the Contractor and shall allow the Ministry full access at any time during working hours .
The Ministry Representative will review the Contractor ’ s performance of the Work and determine the acceptability of the Work based on the Ministry ’ s Quality Assurance results and , where deemed appropriate by the Ministry Representative , supplemented by the Contractor ’ s Quality Control results .
Work failing to meet the conditions of the Contract shall be considered Unacceptable Work .
The Ministry Representative may consider all Work from the last acceptable Quality Assurance testing as Unacceptable Work .
The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment for Work that lacks the appropriate Quality Control documentation , verified by the QC Manager , as required by the Contract .
The Contractor shall implement a well-coordinated approach to all operations related to the Work and will organize its team and operations in keeping with the goal of doing things right the first time .

The Contractor shall prepare a Quality Control Plan ( QC Plan ) in accordance with the Contract provisions and shall submit the complete QC Plan to the Ministry Representative a minimum of two weeks in advance of commencement of any element of Work covered by the plan .
The QC Plan shall be structured around the ISO 9001:2000 program ( although ISO registration is not required ) , and clearly demonstrate the Contractor ’ s understanding and commitment to ISO ’ s eight principles of quality management :  Customer focused organization  Leadership  Involvement of people  Process approach  System approach to management  Continual improvement  Factual approach to decision-making  Mutually beneficial supplier relationships .
The QC Plan must also include sections detailing the Contractor ’ s methodology associated with each of the relevant sections of ISO 9001:2000 as listed in Table 101-A .
No Work shall be undertaken on any element of Work ( including payment Items and incidental Work , or submittals for review ) for which there are QC Plan submission requirements until the Ministry has accepted the base portion of the QC Plan and the specific details for that element of Work .
Subject to the submission requirements outlined in SS 101.02.03 , the QC Plan is required to cover the Work in its entirety , including without limitation all materials the Contractor and Subcontractors are supplying , and all items and phases of construction on the Project .
The plan may be operated wholly or in part by a qualified Subcontractor or an independent agency/organization .
However , the plan ’ s administration ( including SECTION 101 QUALITY MANAGEMENT 101 ( 2 of 6 ) 2016 BC MoT conformance with the plan and its modifications ) and the quality of the Work remain the responsibility of the Contractor .
The Contractor ’ s QC program and the Work shall be undertaken in accordance with the QC Plan and shall be well managed , with testing results representative of actual operations .

SECTION 101 QUALITY MANAGEMENT 101 ( 4 of 6 ) 2016 BC MoT 101.02.03 QC Plan Submission Requirements ( Contract–Specific ) – Each QC Plan submission to the Ministry shall be accompanied by a QC checklist prepared by the Contractor demonstrating that the submission has been checked for compliance with contractual requirements .
( i ) Full Submission Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions , the Contractor ’ s QC plan shall provide details of the means , methods , and frequencies of Quality Control measures for all elements of Work ( whether payment Items or incidental ) in the Contract .
( ii ) Partial Submission On projects considered by the Ministry to be of low complexity and/or risk , and only where explicitly invoked by the Special Provisions , the Ministry will accept a partial QC Plan submission .
Notwithstanding any such reduced submission requirements , the Contractor remains responsible for QC for all aspects of the Work .
The Contractor ’ s partial QC Plan submission to the Ministry Representative is only required to address the details of the following types of Work :  Traffic Management  Survey/layout  Materials incorporated into the Work ( concrete barrier , culverts , filter cloth , lock-blocks , etc . )
 Compaction ( subgrade , embankments , granular aggregates , culvert backfill , etc . )
 Aggregate gradation  Plus any other elements identified in the Special Provisions as a submission requirement .
The Contractor shall initiate such other Quality Control procedures as are necessary for ensuring the production of a quality product and may include them in the Quality Control Plan submission .
( iii ) For Both Full and Partial Submissions The initial QC Plan shall be submitted to the Ministry Representative a minimum of seven ( 7 ) days in advance of the Project pre-construction meeting and must provide details of all elements of Work anticipated to be undertaken within the Contractor ’ s first thirty ( 30 ) days on Site .
Detailed submissions for the balance of the Work must be received a minimum of seven ( 7 ) days prior to the anticipated first day of Work on each element covered by the submission .
The initial submission , as well as any subsequent submission or revision , must be accompanied by the Contractor ’ s QC checklist for Quality Management , verifying that the submission meets all relevant contractual requirements .
Improved procedures may be introduced after the start of work as necessary as amendments to the Quality Control Plan .
All amendments require the written acceptance of the Ministry Representative .
The type and frequency of QC tests shall be established by the Contractor and shall be in conformance with the requirements of the Contract , including the minimum frequencies specified in the Special Provisions and/or Standard Specifications ( for those listed items applicable to the Work ) , and the current acceptable practice of the industry .
When materials or equipment are specified by standard or performance specifications the Contractor shall obtain from suppliers or manufacturers independent test reports , or test certificates stating that the materials or equipment meet or exceed specified requirements .
The Contractor shall provide back-up documentation of actual testing results upon request by the Ministry Representative .
101.03 Quality Assurance Plan – The Ministry will prepare and implement a Quality Assurance Plan , based in part on the effectiveness and reliability of the Contractor ’ s Quality Control Plan .
The Ministry may also undertake random and systematic inspections of the Work and of the Contractor ’ s QC documentation .
The purpose of the QA Plan and inspectional activities is to ensure that payment is made only for acceptable works in place , and may be based on a limited amount of sampling and testing .
The Ministry Representative will monitor the Contractor ’ s operations and the Quality Control program to assure that standards are being met and to assess what payments have been earned under the terms of the Contract .
Any instances of Unacceptable Work discovered will result in a Non-Conformance Report being issued to the Contractor .
The QA program activities will not relieve the Contractor of Quality Control responsibilities under the terms of the Contract .
The frequency of QA inspection and testing will generally be approximately zero to ten percent ( 0 – 10 % ) of the frequencies undertaken by the Contractor in its QC Plan and will initially be set at a level commensurate with the Ministry Representative ’ s confidence in the anticipated effectiveness of the Contractor ’ s QC program .
The Ministry Representative may increase or decrease the frequency of QA inspection and testing during the course SECTION 101 QUALITY MANAGEMENT BC MoT 2016 101 ( 5 of 6 ) of the Work , based in part on the actual effectiveness of the Contractor ’ s QC Plan .
101.04 Quality Audit – The Ministry may have one or more auditors on the Project , supplementing the work of the Ministry QA staff .
When utilized , the auditor ( s ) will report to the Ministry Representative and provide a systematic and independent assessment of whether or not the materials and Project activities and related results comply with the Contract , the Contractor ’ s QC Plan , and the Ministry ’ s QA Plan .
These auditors may be Ministry employees but will be assigned from resources which have not otherwise been involved with the Work .
The objective of Quality Auditing is to have an independent opinion on both QC and QA activities and be proactive in avoiding or reducing quality related issues by requiring the process of conformance verification to be systematic .
The auditor ( s ) will be allowed unrestricted access to the Site and all activities therein , to all testing and documentation of the work done by the Ministry , Contractor and their agents and suppliers .
101.05 Non-Conformance Reports ( NCRs ) – The Contractor shall and the Ministry may review the Work to determine conformance with the contractual requirements .
Non-conformances found shall be dealt with as follows .

The Contractor and/or the QC Manager may consult with the Ministry Representative on the resolutions but is not required to do so .
Payment for a Quality Management will not be affected by internal NCRs , as long as the issue is diligently pursued and resolved .
Payment for the Work itself may be withheld until the NCR issue is resolved .
101.05.02 Ministry-Issued NCR – Should the Ministry ’ s QA reporting indicate that the Work is not in conformance , the Ministry Representative will issue to the Contractor a NCR , including a response time .
The Contractor shall then respond to that NCR , within the specified time , with proposed resolutions and corrective actions .
The Ministry Representative will accept or reject the proposed resolution and corrective action proposal .
Assurance testing and inspection will be performed to determine if the corrective action has provided an acceptable product .
Acceptance and rejection will continue until the Ministry Representative determines that a quality product has been achieved .
A portion of the payment for a Quality Management may be withheld until the NCR issue is resolved or , in accordance with SS 101.07 , may be withheld permanently .
Payment for the Work itself may be withheld until the NCR issue is resolved .
101.05.03 Opportunity for Improvement – Should the QA review indicate that the Work is not in conformance , but the variance is deemed minor by the Ministry Representative , the Ministry Representative may issue an Opportunity for Improvement ( OFI ) report .
The Contractor is encouraged to review the findings and undertake such modifications to the QC Plan and the work procedures as necessary to address the issue .
An OFI will not affect payment for Quality Management or for the Work itself .
101.06 Appeal – If the Contractor disputes the validity of a finding in an NCR , the Contractor may file an appeal with the Ministry Representative .
The Ministry Representative and the Contractor Representative will use all reasonable efforts to refine the area of dispute and to resolve the determination of conformance with the Contract .
If the Ministry Representative and the Contractor Representative can not come to a mutually agreeable resolution , the Work that is the subject of the Non- Conformance Report shall be re-evaluated by an independent third-party , selected by the Ministry Representative in consultation with the Contractor , at a test frequency equivalent to twice that specified in the Contract or to such other frequency as may be mutually agreed between the Ministry Representative and the Contractor .
If the appeal testing confirms the non-conformance determination , all appeal testing costs will be borne by the Contractor .
If the appeal testing shows that the Work did in fact meet the requirements of the Contract , all appeal testing costs will be borne by the Ministry .
101.07 Payment – The Lump Sum Price bid for Quality Management shall be full compensation for all costs resulting from the Quality Management requirements set out in the Contract .
Payment will be made on a monthly basis prorated for the percentage of the total Work completed as determined by the Ministry Representative , subject to the Contractor SECTION 101 QUALITY MANAGEMENT 101 ( 6 of 6 ) 2016 BC MoT being totally compliant with the requirements of this Section and with its own Quality Control Plan .
The Ministry Representative , in consultation with the Ministry construction manager following the issuance of a Ministry- issued NCR pursuant to SS 107.05.02 may deduct an amount from any monthly payment so computed , for any quality management work required but not satisfactorily undertaken during that month .
The Ministry Representative may also reduce the total Lump Sum payable by the value of any quality management work required but not satisfactorily undertaken during the Term of the Contract .
The foregoing determinations will be made in the sole discretion of the Ministry Representative .
Inspection or testing by the Ministry Representative will be at the Ministry ’ s cost .
However , re-inspection or re- testing by the Ministry for repaired or replaced Work items that originally did not meet contract requirements shall be at the Contractor ’ s cost .
Work that is deemed unacceptable in accordance with SS 101.01 will not be eligible for payment from the applicable Item for that Work .
The Completion Certificate will not be issued if there are any unresolved Non-Conformance Reports .

MATERIALS 202.02 Aggregate Classification 202.02.01 Crushed Surfacing Aggregates : i ) High Fines Granular Surfacing Aggregate ( HFSA ) : HFSA is used for surfacing of gravel roads .
Cohesion for this aggregate is achieved by plastic fines .
202.02.02 Crushed Base Course Aggregates – These are high strength , high load bearing , high quality , crushed granular base materials .
As these materially are not well suited for long-term traffic , they are usually overlaid by surface course materials ( HFSA or asphalt/concrete pavement ) .
i ) Well-Graded Base ( WGB ) : WGB is the standard base course material used for pavement structures .
It is well-graded with moderate permeability .
ii ) Intermediate Graded Base ( IGB ) : IGB is intermediate in gradation and permeability between well-graded aggregate and open graded aggregate .
iii ) Open Graded Base ( OGB ) : OGB contains a small percentage of fine material and is highly permeable , gap graded aggregate .
202.02.03 Subbase Aggregates – A granular material placed between the sub-grade and the base course aggregates , providing strength and drainage to the pavement structure .
i ) Granular Sub-base ( SGSB ) : SGSB is the standard aggregate , crushed or screened , placed directly above subgrade , with moderate permeability and a wide gradation .
ii ) Intermediate Graded Sub-base ( IGSB ) : IGSB is a higher permeability , crushed sub-base aggregate .
iii ) Open Graded Subbase ( OGSB ) : OGSB is a highly permeable , crushed subbase aggregate .
202.02.04 Bridge End Fill ( BEF ) – BEF is quality granular fill placed behind and below a bridge abutment to provide good drainage , a smooth transition from the bridge approaches to the bridge structure , and a suitable material through which to drive piles .
202.03 General Description of Work – The aggregates for granular surfacing , base and subbase may be supplied either by the Contractor or produced from a Ministry provided source .
Production of granular surfacing and granular base requires crushing and placing in stockpile .
Production of select granular subbase may be by crushing , screening or direct excavation .
Granular aggregate shall be loaded from the stockpile , crushing and screening plant , or pit face , as may be applicable ; hauled out to the site , placed accurately without segregation and thoroughly compacted to established line and grade .
The Contractor shall maintain the prepared surface of the base course aggregate until it has been paved or until completion of the contract , whichever is applicable .
202.04 Aggregate Quality 202.04.01 General – Granular aggregate shall be composed of inert , clean , tough , durable particles of crushed rock , gravel , sand and fines capable of withstanding the deleterious effects of exposure to water , freeze-thaw , handling , spreading and compacting and design traffic loading .
The aggregate particles shall be uniform in quality and free from clay lumps , wood and free from an excess of flat or elongated pieces .
Aggregates for surfacing , base , subbase and bridge end fill will be tested in accordance with the tests listed in Table 202-A .
202.04.02 Primary Quality Tests – All aggregates for surfacing , base , subbase , and bridge end fill shall meet the requirements of Table 202-B .
Where the Ministry has pre-existing test results , the Ministry will make this information available to the Contractor and the Contractor will be able to rely on the factual data and not have to perform the corresponding primary quality tests on materials extracted from the investigated portions of the pit or quarry .
SECTION 202 GRANULAR SURFACING , BASE AND SUB-BASES 202 ( 2 of 13 ) 2016 BC MoT In circumstances where historic performance of material from a source has proven satisfactory , the Ministry may , by Special Provision , waive any or all of the testing required in SS 202.04 .
202.04.03 Secondary Quality Tests – All aggregates for surfacing , base , subbase , and bridge end fill failing any primary quality test indicated in SS 202.04.02 shall further be tested as follows to determine acceptability or , at the Contractor ’ s option and at the Contractor ’ s expense , a new source shall be found .
i ) If the Micro Deval test results show that the material fails , then the soundness shall be reassessed by use of Magnesium Sulphate ( ASTM C 88 ) .
The material will be considered acceptable if the loss after 5 cycles is less than 20 % for coarse aggregate ( the material retained on or above the 4.75 mm sieve ) .
 25 % for fine aggregate ( the material passing the 4.75 mm sieve ) ii ) If the aggregate fails any of the Sand Equivalent , Micro-Deval or Magnesium Sulphate tests , then the Contractor shall perform the Ministry ’ s petrographic test ( SS 202 , Appendix 2 ) to determine the cause of failure .
The Ministry Representative may review the test results and determine whether the material is acceptable or not .
202.05 Aggregate Gradation - Gradation shall be determined in accordance with ASTM C 117 ( Wash Test ) .
202.05.01 Aggregate shall have a gradation that defines a curve ( % passing versus log sieve size ) with a slope between adjacent sieves , equal or intermediate to the corresponding slopes of the boundary curves defined by the specification .
Gradations shall fall within the limits , for the specified classification , shown in Table 202-C. 202.05.02 Rut Resistance – Any aggregate supplied must , in addition to meeting the gradation requirements specified above , not rut when proof rolled with a truck having a 9 tonne single axle dual tire or 17 tonne tandem axle group with dual tires with a tire pressure of 600 kPa .
Any aggregate which does rut shall be removed and replaced , or blended with suitable aggregates , to meet both the gradation requirement and the rut resistance requirement .
USE OF MINISTRY-PROVIDED PITS OR QUARRIES 202.06 General – Ministry-provided pits and quarries are those identified in the Special Provisions which the Ministry is offering to the Contractor as potential aggregate sources .
They may include pits and quarries : a. owned by the Ministry b. leased by the Ministry , or c. attained by the Ministry through special agreement with the landowner .
Use of such pits and quarries will be at the Contractor ’ s option unless the Special Provisions clearly state that the source must be used for specific purposes .
When a Ministry pit or quarry is provided for the Contractor ’ s optional use under the Contract , the Contractor , by entering the pit or quarry , will be deemed to have accepted all obligations , risks and costs for the production of aggregate meeting the requirements of Part B of this section .
The Ministry gives no warranty that its pit or quarry will meet the quality and quantity requirements .
Where a pit or quarry is designated as a mandatory source , the Ministry waives the aggregate quality requirements of SS 202.04.02 except for the Fractured Faces requirement for aggregates required by the Ministry to be produced from that source .

In such event , the crushed 25 mm base course aggregate so used will be paid for only at the rates bid for subbase , provided the same Contractor is responsible for the construction of both the crushed base , and subbase .
The crushed base course shall be constructed in such a manner that the aggregate is neither segregated , contaminated nor degraded .
End dumping will not be permitted .
The thickness of the crushed base course shall be substantially uniform and the minimum thickness shall not be less than the nominal thickness shown on the Drawings or ordered by the Ministry Representative .
If the Contractor is unable to provide adequate manually operated equipment or workers of sufficient skill to lay the crushed base course aggregate within the tolerances specified , the Ministry Representative may require that the Contractor lay the aggregate through an approved electronically controlled spreading machine .
202.26.02 Compaction – Immediately following spreading , the crushed base course aggregate shall be compacted to a minimum 100 % of the Standard Proctor Density obtained by the current ASTM D 698 .

No advance payment will be made for pit run aggregates .
Recovery of the advance payment will be made on each progress estimate as the respective aggregate is subsequently withdrawn from the stockpile , with an additional adjustment on the final progress estimate for any material remaining in stockpile such that the entire advance payment is recovered .
202.36.03 Surplus Aggregate Where actual aggregate needs on the Contract fall below the Approximate Quantity indicated on Schedule 7 , the Ministry will compensate the Contractor at the rates indicated in Table 202-F for a portion of surplus aggregates produced by the Contractor which meet all the applicable quality and gradation specifications of the contract .
For each classification of aggregate , the maximum quantity of surplus aggregate eligible for compensation shall be the Approximate Quantity of that aggregate on Schedule 7 minus the quantity of that aggregate paid on the final progress estimate .
There will be no compensation for surplus aggregate for pit run aggregates or for any portion of the production on other aggregates which are beyond the Approximate Quantity .

The test is performed after a micro deval soundness test or a magnesium sulphate soundness test indicates that the granular materials are weak , non durable or suspect .
The petrographic analysis test is to prove or determine the cause of the poor performance of the aggregate and to determine the extent or contributing factors of specific rock types or the extent of deleterious materials or clay particles .
This information will be used to determine the possible use of the materials .
Scope : The test shall be performed by a qualified professional with experience in rock type identification , rock classification and gravel/aggregate sources and use ; and shall be presented in a signed report that details findings .
Recognized procedures for rock identification shall be used .
The procedures involve simple physical and chemical tests , such as the hardness scratch test , hydrochloric acid reaction and visual surface examination assisted by magnifying lens .
The predominance of easily distinguishable types in petrographic samples will permit reasonably accurate testing .
Important accessories are a sample kit , the rock and mineral descriptions and a good text .
Rock types are to be listed by percentage weight under the broad categories of origin ( sedimentary- metamorphic-igneous ) with condition descriptions ( i.e .
hardness , weathering and cementation ) .
Note that the descriptions of quality regarding durability or soundness ( good , fair , poor , deleterious ) are vital to the test results .

Construction , Fabrication and erection shall be in accordance with the specifications for Highway Construction and the specifications prepared for the particular structure .
SECTION 215 BRIDGES 215 ( 2 of 2 ) 2016 BC MoT THIS PAGE IS LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK BC MoT 2016 216 ( 1 of 13 ) SECTION 216 COATING OF STEELWORK 216.01 Scope -This Section covers the operations required for shop , field and/or maintenance coating of structural and miscellaneous steel surfaces .
The coating process includes pre-cleaning , surface preparation , coating , and curing of coatings .
216.02 Definitions 216.02.01 Good Painting Practice - The application of generally accepted methods and equipment to clean , contain and coat industrial structures in a safe , practical , environmentally sensitive manner resulting in a long lasting quality protective coating system .
These principals are laid out in this Section .
Many of the points are drawn from the SSPC ( Society for Protective Coatings ) publication Steel Structures Painting Manual Volume 1 , Good Painting Practice .
References are to the current edition unless otherwise stated .
These practices are based on experience in the United States and where they conflict with Canadian or British Columbia laws , regulations or guidelines , the local regulations shall prevail .
216.02.02 Shop , Field and Maintenance Coating - This consists of the series of operations that include the surface preparation , pre-treatment ( if required ) and application of coatings to structural steel surfaces either in the shop or in field .
It also includes the supplying of all labour , equipment and materials .
In addition , it encompasses the protection of newly coated surfaces during curing , transport and erection as well as the protection of traffic , property and the environment .
Additionally , it also includes the disposal of waste material in accordance with all applicable environmental , fisheries and local regulations and bylaws .
216.02.03 Painting / Coating - The terms painting and coating are considered synonymous for the purposes of this document .
Techniques such as metallizing or galvanizing , while not typically thought of as painting , are considered here to be painting or coating since they form part or all of a protective system .
216.02.04 Shop Coating - Shop coating is the coating of steel or other components in a shop or plant before shipment to the site of erection .
This may include part of a coating system or the whole system including the topcoat .
216.02.05 Field Coating - Field coating is the coating of steel or components at the place of erection .
216.02.06 Maintenance Coating – Maintenance coating is the coating of structures in service that have previously been partially or completely coated .
The maintenance coating may be one of four general types : 216.02.06.01 Touchup – Touchup is the cleaning and coating of small selected areas on a structure .
Typically , this is used to repair damaged or failed areas of coating .
For repairs , sufficient coats are added to bring the new coating up to the level of the existing coating surrounding the repairs .
It may also be used as an interim maintenance strategy to extend the lifetime of a coating system overall .
Coat– Zone coating is the coating process where specific whole parts of a structure are coated and others are deliberately left .
This deals with larger portions of a structure than touchup coating .
For example an above deck arch portion of a bridge would be zone coated , but the edges of the flanges would be touched up .
Zone coating may use touchup , overcoat , or recoat strategies to meet its objectives .
Zone coating also includes coating new steel added to old structures for example steel added for seismic upgrades .
216.02.06.03 Overcoating – Overcoating is the coating of portions of a structure where the structure is touched up , then coated with a topcoat overall .
It may include top coating part or all of the structure .
216.02.06.04 Recoating – Recoating is the coating process where larger portions of old coating on a structure are removed to bare metal and a completely new coating system is applied over the entire area .
216.02.07 Anchor Profile - The anchor profile is a measure of the roughness of the prepared surface .
The profile is normally measured from surface peak to surface valley and expressed as a range ( for example 50 to 75 µm or 2 to 3 mils ) .
Besides the depth , the surface profile is dependant on the grit type used to create it .
Mineral abrasives such as sand , slag , garnet , etc .
produce a ‘ sharp ’ profile .
Steel shot produces a rounded profile unless mixed with 15 % steel grit .
Normally the anchor profile is specified for both depth and sharpness .
216.02.08 Containment / Hoarding - The process of encapsulating the work site so that hazardous or nuisance materials can not escape to the surrounding environment .
SSPC Guide 6 Guide for Containing Debris Generated During Paint Removal Operations specifies types and levels of containment necessary for various cleaning operations .
216.02.09 Ambient Conditions - Ambient conditions refer to such things as wind , relative humidity , dew point , air temperature , substrate temperature etc .
that affect the cleaning , application , and curing of coatings .
They are very important in obtaining a properly adhered , long life coating .
All coating works shall be within the specified parameters as given in SS 216.08.04 , SS 216.08.05 and SS 216.08.09 .
Where ambient environmental conditions do not fall within these conditions , coating work may continue if the conditions are being met within the containment .
This may mean extra hoarding , dehumidification , ventilation and/or temperature control for the duration of cleaning , application and curing of the coating system .
SECTION 216 COATING OF STEELWORK 216 ( 2 of 13 ) 2016 BC MoT It is worthy of note that some coatings are designed to be applied in conditions outside those mentioned above .
These coatings and their conditions of use will be individually considered for use .
216.03 Reference Standards - It is recognized that standards are changed or amended from time to time .
All specifications mentioned shall be the current editions at the date and time of contract signing unless a specific edition of a reference or standard is stated here or in the Contract Special Provisions .
216.03.01 British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure 216.03.01.01 Recognized Products List ( RPL ) - The Ministry publishes a Recognized Products List of products .

( Applies if the criteria in any one or more of the adjacent columns occurs ) 17 or more 7 or more 3 or more The profile shall be measured over the entire length of the pavement exclusive of structures and shoulder areas .
Acceleration , deceleration and turning lanes are considered part of the driving lanes and shall be tested in accordance with this provision .
For the measuring process , the Contractor shall provide the Ministry Representative a chalk guideline in the centre of the lane immediately prior to measurement .
502.57.05 Auxiliary Lanes – For smoothness testing , sections of the driving lanes that do not fall within the continuous through lanes , such as acceleration lanes , deceleration lanes and turning lanes , and lanes which are less than 1 km in length , shall be treated as follows .
The ratio of the section length to the standard Lot length of 1 km shall be determined and the payment adjustment shall be pro-rated on this basis as in the following example : For a segment 565 metres long , the payment adjustment factor is = Length of segment / Length of standard Lot = 565 m/1000 m = 0.565 Hence the applicable payment adjustment is 0.565 times the payment adjustment for a 1 km Lot as determined from Table 502-J .
502.57.06 Sub-Lot and Lot Acceptance Limits – The reject limit and payment adjustments applicable to a road for smoothness are specified in Table 502-J .
The default values in the “ Standard ” column shall apply except where the Special Provisions specify that “ Alternate ” values apply .
The International Roughness Index ( IRI ) value , calculated for each Sub-Lot , will be used to determine if the Sub-Lot or Lot will be accepted , and if so whether it will be subject to any payment adjustment .
The Lot IRI is the average of the individual IRI values for the Sub-Lots within the Lot .
A Sub-Lot is rejected if :  It has an IRI within the applicable reject zone shown in Table 502-J , subject to SS 502.57.08 ;  For Top Lift only , there are obvious defects per SS 502.32 or it has unrepaired smoothness deficiencies which require remediation in accordance with SS 502.57.09 .
A Lot is rejected for Smoothness if any Sub-Lot is rejected .
502.57.07 Payment Adjustments – For Top Lift only , the payment adjustments per the applicable column of Table 502-J shall apply to each Lot .
502.57.08 Remedial Work – If the test results on a Sub-Lot of pavement indicate a payment reduction or rejection because of smoothness , the Contractor may propose remedial work to improve the smoothness .
Such proposals are subject to the acceptance of the Ministry Representative , but such acceptance does not imply that the proposed remedy will be successful , and does not reduce the Contractor ’ s responsibility for meeting the acceptance requirements .
Grinding may be acceptable , but an overlay may be required .
Only one attempt may be made to improve smoothness , and this must be completed within ten ( 10 ) calendar days from the time the Contractor receives notification from the Ministry Representative of the original smoothness test results for that Sub-Lot .
Following any attempt to improve the smoothness of a Sub-Lot or Sub-Lots , the Ministry Representative will SECTION 502 ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION ( EPS ) 502 ( 24 of 31 ) 2016 BC MoT retest the Sub-Lot or Sub-Lots , and the new results will replace the previous data for the purposes of determining acceptance and payment .
No payment will be made for any material , equipment or manpower used to improve , or attempt to improve , smoothness .
502.57.09 Smoothness Deficiencies – Smoothness deficiencies ( bumps and dips ) less than 12 mm over 3 m will not have remedial work required .
Individual deficiencies between 8 mm and 12 mm over 3 m will result in a $ 200.00 penalty for each occurrence .
Deficiencies exceeding 12 mm over 3 m will require remedial work .
502.58 Overlays as a Corrective Measure – If an overlay is used as a corrective measure on a defective Lot or Sub-Lot , the overlay thickness will be subject to the acceptance of the Ministry Representative , but shall not be less than 40 mm .
In all other respects , the whole overlay will be subject to the same specifications as the pavement being overlaid .
Where an overlay is used as a corrective measure in any lane , adjacent lanes shall also be overlaid whether acceptable or not .

This specification allows for the use of both Classified and Unclassified RAP .
The contractor ’ s development and processing of RAP into an end paving product must meet SS 502 Asphalt Pavement Construction ( EPS ) for Highway Construction .
The maximum allowable percentage of RAP allowed in asphalt pavement will be based on the classification of the roadway and the location of the mix in the pavement structure or as identified in the Special Provisions .
505.02 Roadway Categories Roadways are divided into the following 2 categories :  Category A – All numbered Highways .
 Category B - Other Roads .
The roadway Category shall be identified in the Special Provisions .
505.03 Definitions Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement ( RAP ) – Removed and/or reprocessed pavement materials containing asphalt and aggregates .
These materials are generated when asphalt pavements are removed for reconstruction and/or resurfacing .
When properly screened and crushed , it consists of high quality aggregate coated by asphalt cement .
Classified RAP – RAP obtained from Ministry roadways will be termed as Classified RAP .
Unclassified RAP – RAP obtained from non-Ministry sources or mixed with RAP from other sources .
Rheology - is the study of deformation and flow of matter .
For asphalt binder rheology , it refers to the flow characteristics of the asphalt binder in the asphalt mix .
Deformation and flow of the asphalt binder in asphalt mix is important in determining asphalt pavement performance .
505.04 Allowable RAP Addition Rates The maximum RAP allowed in the asphalt mix shall be determined by the contribution of the RAP Asphalt Cement ( AC ) towards the total AC content in the mix by weight as per the percentages specified in Table 505-A .
The Contractor shall notify the Ministry Representative , 14 days in advance of Paving if RAP will be used in the project , and shall fill all fields as applicable and sign this Appendix II – RAP RECORD SHEET and submit it to the Ministry Representative 10 days in advance unless the project Special Provisions state differently .
Table 505-A : Maximum Percent RAP AC Replacement allowed in Asphalt Mix Road Classification Top Lift Lower Lifts Category A 15 30 Category B 30 30 The amount of total AC replaced by AC in the RAP will be calculated as follows : % AC Replacement = ( a x b ) c Where ; a = AC content of RAP b = RAP percent in mixture by total weight of mix c = Total Percent AC content in mixture Inclusion of RAP into the hot mix asphalt will be as per the maximum allowable percentage of AC replacement unless otherwise noted in the Special Provisions .
505.05 Materials 505.05.01 RAP ���� The Contractor shall fulfill or exceed the requirements of SS 505 Appendix 1 – RAP Management Best Practices for the management of RAP materials from the time of collection through processing , mix design and quality control practices during the production of asphalt mixtures containing RAP and the Contractor SECTION 505 USE OF RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION 505 ( 2 of 6 ) 2016 BC MoT shall provide documentation to the Ministry Representative that best practices have been followed in the handling , classification , and storage of RAP material , prior to being allowed to use the RAP .
505.05.02 Asphalt Cement When the Percent RAP AC Replacement amount is greater than 15 % , the blended AC must meet the penetration and viscosity requirements of the specified asphalt cement specified in the Special Provisions ( when penetration graded asphalt cement is specified ) or the temperature requirements of the specified Performance Graded Asphalt Cement ( PGAC ) when a PGAC is specified or substituted for penetration graded asphalt cement .
505.05.03 Use of Rejuvenators Usage of Softening agents , rejuvenators or recycling agents will not be permitted .
505.05.03 Use of Recycled Asphalt Shingles Usage of Recycled asphalt shingles will not be permitted .
505.06 RAP Sampling Sampling of the RAP shall be as per SS 505 Appendix 1 – RAP Management Best Practices .
505.07 Quality Control The quality control testing requirements for RAP shall be based on the percent of AC replacement in the asphalt mix as per the requirements listed in Table 505 –B and the Minimum test frequency guidelines for Quality Control listed in ( Table 505-C in Appendix I ) 505.07.01 RAP Aggregate Testing a ) Basic Tests The following basic properties shall be determined for the proposed RAP :  Moisture Content ;  Asphalt Content ;  Gradation ;  Percent Fracture ; and  Specific Gravity of coarse and fine fractions ( for mix design purposes ) .
Individual representative RAP samples shall be tested to determine moisture content , gradation , percent fracture and asphalt content .
Tests to determine the specific gravity of the coarse and fine fractions of RAP shall be completed on the combined aggregates ( obtained by combining the individual reclaimed aggregates retained after the extraction of the asphalt cement ) .
b ) Consensus Tests The tests for the consensus properties shall be completed on the combined aggregates ( virgin aggregates and reclaimed aggregates ) mixed in the proportions proposed for the mix design .
The following aggregate consensus properties shall be determined for the combined aggregate samples :  Maximum Micro Deval Abrasion loss factor ( % ) ;  Standard Test Methods for un-compacted void content of fine aggregate ( as influenced by particle shape , surface texture and grading ) ( ASTM C1252 ) ; and  Percentage of flat and elongated particles ( for Superpave mixes only ) .
505.07.02 AC Rheology Testing When AC rheology testing and design is required , the blended AC must meet the penetration and viscosity requirements of the specified AC type .
For penetration graded asphalt , rheology is measured in terms of penetration at 25oC and viscosity at 60oC .
For performance grade asphalt cements ( PGAC ) , rheology is tested as per the procedures outlined in AASHTO MP1 and reported in terms of high and low temperature service ratings , i.e .
PG 58-34 .
Since the rheological properties of asphalt binder vary with temperature , rheological characterization involves two key considerations :  To compare different asphalt binders , their rheological properties must be measured at some common reference temperature .
 To fully characterize an asphalt binder , its rheological properties must be examined over the range of temperatures that it may encounter during its life .
For mixes specified to use PGAC , the blended AC must meet the temperature requirements of the specified PGAC .
For asphalt mixtures containing RAP and specified to use Performance Graded ( PG ) asphalts , the RAP rheology and the grade of virgin asphalt to be used shall be determined according to Appendix X1 of AASHTO MP2 .

A '' best '' practice may evolve to become better as improvements are discovered .
Best practice is considered to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that are commonly achieved in the industry .
RAP Sources - RAP may be obtained from several sources .
The common sources of RAP are : Cold Milling – This is the most common source of RAP .
The milling process should be closely examined to make sure that the milled material is not contaminated with soil , base materials , paving geotextiles or other foreign material ( sulphur , asbestos , rubber etc . ) .
The milled material that becomes contaminated should be stockpiled separately from RAP to be used in asphalt mix .
A special milling operation may also be beneficial when it is desirable to mill the surface layer in one pass and the underlying layers in a second pass because the surface course millings may contain aggregates with higher fractured aggregates that could be incorporated in the new surface layers .
Full Depth Pavement Removal – RAP can also be obtained from the removal of the existing pavement using a bulldozer or a backhoe .
This process typically results in large chunks of pavement that may be contaminated with underlying soils .
This contaminated material should be stored in a separate stockpile and not to be used in the hot mix asphalt .
Asphalt Plant Waste – This includes the waste generated during plant start-up , transition between mixes , plant clean out , mix rejected from projects and excess mix produced that could not be placed .
This material usually has fewer fines than the typical RAP since it wasn ’ t milled or broken up during pavement removal and the AC is less aged than RAP since it hasn ’ t been subjected to environmental aging .
This material should be stockpiled and tested separately from the other RAP .
RAP Contamination – Best practice for RAP stockpiles is to keep them free from contaminants .
RAP stockpiles should be treated as a valuable material .
Truck drivers bringing the material on the site should ensure that unwanted debris or contaminated material does not end up in the RAP stockpile .
The plant QC personnel and the loader operators should continuously monitor processed and unprocessed RAP stockpiles to make sure that they do not contain deleterious materials .
If any contaminants are found , they should be removed immediately so that they are not covered up with other RAP brought on to the yard .
RAP Categories – RAP obtained from MoT sources is referred to as Classified RAP .
RAP obtained from non MoT sources or mixed with RAP from other projects is referred to as Unclassified RAP .
RAP Processing – Best practice for RAP processing involves one or more steps to create consistent materials .
Screening is used to separate sizes .
In some cases , it may be desirable to screen or fractionate RAP to coarse and fine fractions .
RAP separation based on sizes increases quality and reduces variability in the RAP properties .
For stockpiles of RAP from multiple sources , particularly stockpiles containing oversize fragments of RAP or pavement slabs , the material should be processed to produce RAP with a maximum size of 37.5 mm for use in hot mix asphalt .
Further processing of RAP may include both screening and crushing to produce a uniform gradation , AC content and other properties .
Since crushing RAP will create more aggregate fines , it is best to set up the crushing operation so that the RAP is screened before it enters the crusher .
RAP processing shall occur as early as possible in the construction planning process .
RAP Stockpiling – The best practice to minimize the accumulation of moisture in stockpiles is to cover the stockpile with a shelter , tarp or building to prevent precipitation from getting to the RAP .
RAP stockpiles should be placed on a base with adequate drainage and constructed with minimal segregation .
Arc-shaped , conical , uniform stockpiles are preferred for storing processed or unprocessed SECTION 505 USE OF RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION APPENDIX 1 - RAP MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES BC MoT 2016 505 ( 5 of 6 ) RAP .
No contamination of the RAP from the stockpile base materials should occur .
Use of heavy equipment on top of the RAP stockpile should be minimized to avoid compaction of the RAP .
It is also recommended that the RAP stockpiles be limited to 4 m in height to reduce the potential for self- consolidation of the stockpile .
RAP Sampling - Best practice is for representative RAP samples to be collected from the stockpile prepared for the project .
At least one sample per 750 tonnes of RAP in the stockpile or a minimum of ten samples per stockpile should be taken and retained for testing .
If the asphalt mix from an existing pavement is to be used as RAP , 150 mm diameter cores should be extracted at a frequency of at least one core every 1.5 kilometer in each lane prior to the start of the project .
The asphalt mix from the pavement lift to be recycled should be tested to determine the properties of the aggregates and the asphalt cement in the pavement .
Sampling Method – Best practice for sampling aggregates applies to the sampling of RAP as well .
RAP stockpiles should be sampled as they are being built at the location where they will be fed into the asphalt plant .
Sampling at the time the stockpile is built is the best practice and will be easier and more representative of the stockpile compared to samples taken later after the formation of the crust on the face of the RAP stockpile .
Proper sampling procedures normally used for virgin aggregates should also be used to sample RAP aggregates as included in “ AASHTO T2 : Sampling of Aggregates ” , Standard Specifications for Transportation Materials and Methods of Sampling and Testing , 30th Edition .
Minimum Test Frequencies – The quality control tests on the RAP and the extracted aggregates should be completed at the minimum frequencies specified in Table 505-C : Guidelines for Minimum Quality Control Test Frequencies .
All RAP aggregates retained after extraction should be combined together into one sample .
The combined sample should then be sieved and split into coarse and fine fractions and used to determine the specific gravity of the recycled aggregates .
Stockpile Management – When a stockpile reaches the desired quantity and has been sampled and characterized , no additional RAP material should be added to it .
Subsequent RAP material should be stockpiled in a separate stockpile and characterized in the same manner .
This process should continue such that characterized stockpiles are not compromised by new RAP materials .
Samples from the RAP stockpile should be taken and the testing completed as per the minimum test frequencies specified in Table 505-C. Table 505-C : Guidelines for Minimum Quality Control Test Frequencies Test Minimum Frequency Asphalt Content One per 750 tonnes Gradation One per 750 tonnes Percent Fracture ( % ) One per 750 tonnes Specific Gravity of coarse fraction of RAP Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes or three per stockpile Specific Gravity of fine fraction of RAP Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes or three per stockpile Maximum Micro Deval Abrasion loss factor ( % ) Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes or three per stockpile Fine aggregate angularity Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes or three per stockpile Flat and elongated particles ( For Superpave Only ) Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes or three per stockpile AC Rheology Minimum of One per 3000 tonnes of RAP or a minimum of three tests per project .

Profiles shall be measured and the IRI calculated in the centre of the lane for each Sub-Lot .
IRI values will be recorded to a precision of 0.01 m/km for each Sub-Lot .
The Lot IRI value is the average of the IRI values calculated for the Sub-Lots within the Lot .
For any Sub-Lot between 50 m and 100 m in length , the IRI value shall be considered representative of a complete Sub-Lot .
For any Sub-Lot less than 50 m in length , the IRI value will be combined with the proceeding Sub-Lot IRI value .
The profile shall be measured over the entire length of the pavement exclusive of structures and shoulder areas .
Acceleration , deceleration and turning lanes are considered part of the driving lanes and shall be testing in accordance with this provision .
For the measuring process , the Contractor shall provide the Ministry Representative a chalk guide line in the centre of the lane immediately prior to measurement with a Class I precision rolling profile measuring instrument .
Payment for providing a chalk line for a Class I precision rolling profiler will be paid upon acceptance by the Ministry Representative under the Provisional Sum Item .
515.12.02 Auxiliary Lanes – For smoothness testing , sections of the driving lanes that do not fall within the continuous through lanes , such as acceleration lanes , deceleration lanes and turning lanes , and lanes which are less than 1 km in length , shall be treated as follows .

Payment adjustments are shown in Table 515-D .
The International Roughness Index ( IRI ) value , calculated for each Sub-Lot , will be used to determine if the Lot will be accepted , and if so whether it will be subject to any payment adjustments .
515.12.04 Payment Adjustments for Full or Increased Payment – Acceptance of any Lot at full or increased payment will occur if it contains no obvious defects as per SS 515.22 and in the case of top lift pavement only , the pavement smoothness , as reported by the International Roughness Index ( IRI ) meets the following requirements :  All Sub-Lots shall have an IRI value ≤ 2.0 515.12.05 Rejection Limit – If a Sub-Lot has an IRI > 2.0 , the Sub-Lot is rejected .
515.12.06 Remedial Work – If the test results on a Sub- Lot of pavement indicate a payment reduction or rejection because of smoothness , the Contractor may propose remedial work to improve the smoothness .
Such proposals are subject to the approval of the Ministry Representative , but such approval does not imply that the proposed remedy will be successful , and does not reduce the Contractor ’ s responsibility for meeting the acceptance requirements .
Reprocessing may be acceptable , but cold milling and repaving may be required .
Only one attempt to remediate the reject area ( remediation method chosen by the Contractor ) may be made to improve smoothness , and this must be completed within ten ( 10 ) calendar days from the time the Contractor receives notification from the Ministry Representative of the original smoothness test results for the Sub-Lot .
Should a product still be in reject the Ministry Representative will determine the final remediation method at the Contractor ’ s expense .
No payment will be made for any material , equipment or manpower used to improve , or attempt to improve , smoothness .
