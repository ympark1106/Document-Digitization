Do not place the top slab on single cell box culverts spanning in excess of 10 ft and on multiple cell box culverts until the concrete in the sidewalls has set for at least 12 hours .
Construction joints at the top of sidewalls may be omitted in some cases provided the top slabs are placed as follows : ( 1 ) For single cell box culverts spanning 10 ft or less , the sidewall construction joint may be omitted and the top slab placed on the sidewalls , provided the concrete in the sidewalls is allowed to set for approximately two hours before starting to place the top slab .
( 2 ) Regardless of size or number of cells , a written request may be made to place the top slab on the walls of box culverts per ( 1 ) above .
Submit the proposed plan , including rate and method of placement , and type and size of equipment .
With initial approval , the first section of the structure will serve as a demonstration to confirm that there is no excessive cracking or any other detriment , and that satisfactory results will be obtained .
After receiving final approval , continue placing the 317 420 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE STRUCTURES remainder of the box culvert .
If at any time the Engineer determines that the results are no longer satisfactory , revert to placing the concrete with the 12 hour delay as specified above .
( e ) Forming Concrete Parapets and Median Barriers on Bridges .
Either the slip form method or conventional fixed form method may be used .
However , do not use the slip form method on bridges maintaining traffic or on parapets when railing is specified .
If the slip form method is proposed , demonstrate ability to produce acceptable results .
If the demonstration is unacceptable or acceptable results are not maintained during production , stop the slip form operation , remove the unacceptable work , and modify the construction methods .
If construction modifications do not produce acceptable results , use the fixed form method .
No additional compensation will be made , and no increase will be made in any Contract price .
Nor will any revisions be made to the amount of time to complete the Contract as a result of any required removals , modifications , or changes in the method of placing parapets or barriers .
Notify the Engineer in writing of the proposed method of constructing the parapets and median barriers prior to beginning superstructure work .
The following shall apply to the consideration of slip forming : ( 1 ) Submit evidence of being capable of producing high quality slip formwork .
Prior to beginning any slip form construction , submit a detailed work plan .
Include the type of equipment , materials , and procedures to be used , subcontractors involved in the construction , key personnel who will be performing the work ( names , training , experience , etc .
) , as well as detailed information on the proposed process to satisfactorily complete the work .
( 2 ) When possible , include reference in the work plan to at least three other similar projects completed in the State of Maryland or surrounding states .
As far as practical , these projects shall have been built using the same equipment , personnel , material , and procedures proposed for the project .
The Engineer may visit these completed projects to evaluate the acceptability of the finished product .
318 420 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE STRUCTURES If the Engineer determines that satisfactorily slip formed parapets or median barriers have been demonstrated at the locations submitted in the work plan , the requirements of the off bridge test site specified below may be waived , and the first 50 ft of slip forming on the bridge will be considered the test section for the structure .
This test section shall be completed and approved prior to placing the remaining portions of parapet or bridge median barrier .
( 3 ) Do not begin any slip forming operation without written approval of the work plan .
Any proposed revisions or deviations to the approved work plan shall be submitted and approved prior to making the change .
If ( 2 ) above is not met , complete an acceptable off bridge test section prior to placing any portion of the parapet or bridge median barrier .
Place the appropriate test section of parapet or median barrier using the same equipment , sensor line , support spacing , material , personnel , and procedures described in the work plan .
This test section shall match the structure ’ s horizontal curve as much as practical , be at least 50 ft long , and be placed at a location selected by the Contractor near the bridge site .
Place the off bridge test section with vertical irregularities varying upward and downward at least 3/4 in .
Demonstrate that the method of slip forming can compensate for this deviation and provide a top of parapet or median barrier that is true to the proposed line and grade and not necessarily parallel to top of bridge deck .
This necessitates that the equipment provide for variations in height of vertical face of parapet where it intersects the top of deck slab .
Position , support , and space the sensor line in the same manner that will be used on the bridge decks , with no stakes , holes , etc. , used to support it .
Use the sensor support spacing recommended by the slip form machine manufacturer and as necessary to maintain the planned line and grade .
Use the same rate of slip forming proposed for the bridge .
Saw cut joints in the test section at the same approximate spacing and in the same manner as proposed for the finished bridge .
The Engineer will evaluate the procedure , material , equipment , and appearance of the test section .
319 420 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE STRUCTURES Take three test cores from the test section at directed locations to determine the concrete quality .
Honeycombing , sags , tears , or other evidence of poor quality concrete will be cause for rejection of the test section .
If the test section is rejected , either place additional test sections until approved , or use the fixed form method .
Do not remove the accepted test section until all parapets or median barriers on the bridges are complete .
The slip forming on the bridges will be compared to the approved test section to ensure that similar acceptable structures are being achieved .
Following completion and acceptance of all bridge parapets and median barriers , remove and dispose of the off bridge test section .
The entire testing procedure , including removing and disposing of test units , regardless of whether the procedure is approved or rejected , shall be at no additional cost to the Administration .
When dual bridges are separated by a joint , construct the two parapets that make up the median barrier in separate operations ; not simultaneously .
Allow the first median parapet section to cure for at least 40 hours prior to constructing the second section of median parapet .
Place additional reinforcing steel to brace the parapet against displacement during the extrusion process .
A detail will be included in the Contract Documents .
The alignment and rigidity of the reinforcing steel will be strictly enforced to ensure that the minimum clearances specified for concrete cover are maintained .
Ensure that an uninterrupted flow of concrete is provided to the slip form machine .
Once the slip form machine is set in motion , keep it advancing until it reaches the proposed stopping point .
Organize and schedule the operations in a manner that the next concrete truck will be able to move into position at the slip form machine as soon as the previous truck pulls away without interrupting the machine ’ s uniform advancement .
Under no circumstances may the slip forming be operated in a manner that requires removal of a concrete truck from the bridge before moving another truck into place .
Except for the slip form machine and its concrete supply trucks , do not allow vehicular traffic on the bridge while slip forming operations are in progress .

Include the following precautions : ( a ) Completely clean all surfaces for approval prior to placing the LMC overlay .
( b ) Brush the LMC mixture onto the wetted , prepared surface .
Ensure that all vertical and horizontal surfaces receive a thorough , even coating .
Limit the rate of progress so that the brushed material does not become dry before it is covered with additional materials required for the final grade .
Remove brushed material that has dried prior to LMC placement , and replace it in an acceptable manner .
Dispose of coarse aggregate that accumulates from the brushing operations .
( c ) Place the LMC mixture to approximately 1/4 in .
above grade and then screed with an approved power operated finishing machine to the specified line and grade .
Use a suitable portable lightweight or wheeled work bridge behind the finishing operation .
Hand finishing may be required along the edge .
Joints shall be edge tooled , except when next to metal expansion dams , curbs , and previously placed lanes .
( d ) Separate the screed rails and construction bulkheads from the newly placed material by passing a pointing trowel along their inside face .

Do not grind or chip existing concrete pavement within 6 ft of LMC until the LMC has cured for at least 48 hours .
Do not place LMC at temperatures below 45 F. The LMC may be placed at 45 F , if rising temperature is predicted and anticipated for at least 8 hours .
At temperatures below 55 F , the Engineer will require a longer curing period and conformance with applicable portions of 420.03.13 .
Remove and replace unsatisfactory LMC at no additional cost to the Administration .
Any day during which the curing temperature falls below 50 F will not be counted as a curing day .
When during the curing period the curing temperature falls below 35 F , the work may be considered as being unsatisfactory and rejected .
During delays up to one hour , several layers of wet burlap may be used to protect the end of the placement from drying .
If the delay exceeds one hour , construct a dam or install a bulkhead and wait 12 hours before resuming placement operations .
However , placement may continue provided a gap of sufficient length for the finishing machine to clear the previously placed LMC overlay is left in the lane or strip .
Protect freshly placed LMC overlays from sudden or unexpected rain .

Each gauge shall indicate loads directly in pounds or be accompanied by a chart with which the dial reading can be converted into pounds .
Tensioning systems employing hydraulic gauges shall be equipped with appropriate bypass pipes , valves , and fittings so the gauge reading remains steady until the jacking load is released .
Gauge readings , elongation measurements , and calculations for elongation shall include appropriate allowances for operational losses in the tensioning system due to strand slippage , movement of anchorages and abutments , elongation of abutment anchorage rods , strand rotation , temperature variation , friction , bed shorting , and other forces and influences acting on the strand .
413 440 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS AND SLAB PANELS In multiple strand tensioning systems , clean and lubricate the sliding surfaces to minimize friction .
Establish a force override ( compensatory operational loss correction ) for standard strand pattern series .
Thermal Effects .
Increase the design prestress force by 0.5 percent for each 5 F ambient temperature below 80 F. No adjustment is required when the ambient temperature is above 80 F. Do not stress steel strands when the ambient temperature is below 40 F. After the steel strands are tensioned , maintain the temperature of the air surrounding the steel strands at 40 F or more until the prestress force is transferred to the concrete .
Control of Jacking Force .
Use either manual or automatic pressure cutoff valves for stopping the jacks at the required load .
Use automatic cutoffs capable of adjustment to ensure that the jacking load corresponds to the required load .
Verify the setting accuracy for the automatic cutoff valves whenever there is reason to suspect improper results and at the beginning of each day ’ s operation .

Limit the initial load to 10 percent of the specified tensioning force .
Any initial loading exceeding 10 percent shall be approved by the Engineer ( i.e .
multiple bed casting ) .
Measure the initial load within a tolerance of ± 100 lb .
Do not use the initial elongation measurement to determine the initial force .
In all stressing operations , keep the stressing force symmetrical about the vertical axis ; however , in tensioning single strands , the initial and final loads may be applied in immediate succession to each strand .
Use jack mounted pressure gauges as the primary system of force measurement for the final tensioning of straight single strands .
Check elongation against pressure gauge readings on all strands .
Check vise slippage .
The computed elongation , including operational losses and equivalent elongation for the initial tensioning force , shall agree with the pressure gauge reading within 3 percent .
Use jack mounted pressure gauges as the primary system of force measurement for the final tensioning of multiple strands .
For uniform application of load to the strands , the position of the face of the anchorage at final load shall be parallel to its position under initial load .
Verify parallel movement by measurement of equal movement on opposite anchorage sides and by checking the plumb position of the anchorage before and after final load application .
Check vise slippage .
After stressing the steel strands as specified and placing all other reinforcement , cast the concrete member to the specified length .
Maintain strand stress between anchorages until the concrete has reached the specified compressive strength .
440.03.13 Steel Strand Tensioning .
In all methods of tensioning , measure the stress induced in the strands both by jacking gauges and by elongation .
415 440 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS AND SLAB PANELS If any jack or gauge appears to be giving erratic results or gauge pressures and elongations indicate materially different stresses during manufacturing , recalibration will be required .
Provide means for measuring elongation to the nearest 1/8 in .
For differences in indicated stress between jack pressure and elongation of up to 5 percent , place the difference so that the discrepancy will be on the side of a slight overstress rather than understress .
For discrepancies in excess of 5 percent , carefully check the entire operation and determine the source of the discrepancy before proceeding .
Thoroughly seal split plastic sheathing for debonded steel strands with tape prior to placing concrete .
Cut all pretensioned steel strands flush with the end of the member .
Where the end of the member will not be covered by concrete , clean the exposed ends of the strands and the concrete face .
Use wire brushing or abrasive blast cleaning to remove all dirt and residue that is not firmly bonded to the metal and concrete surfaces .
Coat the strands and the concrete face with a protective coating as specified .
Work the protective coating into all voids in the strands .
440.03.14 Surface Finish and Curing .
Rough finish the top surface of all members with a rake , wire brush , or other approved means to a full amplitude of 1/4 in .
Begin initial curing of all members by fogging , wet burlap , or other approved methods as soon as the concrete is hardened sufficiently to withstand surface damage .
Continue the initial curing until the concrete has attained its initial set , but at least three hours ; however , when a retarding agent is used , continue the initial curing for at least five hours .
Following the initial curing , resume curing using an accelerated curing method .
Accelerated Curing .
Use one of the following methods to accelerate curing of the concrete : ( a ) Low Pressure Steam Curing .
Use a suitable enclosure to contain the live steam and minimize moisture and heat loss .
Ensure that the concrete has attained initial set before application of the live steam .
Do not permit live steam to be directed on the concrete or the forms so as to cause localized high temperatures .
Maintain the temperature of the interior of the enclosure at 80 to 160 F. During initial application of the steam , increase the ambient air 416 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS AND SLAB PANELS 440 temperature within the enclosure at a rate not to exceed 40 F per hour .
Hold the maximum temperature until the concrete has reached the required release strength .
Maintain the steam temperature and the curing temperature uniformly throughout the extremities of the prestressed member .
At the end of curing , reduce the concrete temperature at an average of 40 F per hour .
Ensure that the producer furnishes at least one recording thermometer for each enclosure .
If the enclosure is longer than 300 ft , furnish an additional recording thermometer for each additional 300 ft of length or fraction thereof .
The temperature at any point within the enclosure shall not vary more than 10 F from that of the recording thermometer or the average of the recording thermometers if more than one is used .
( b ) Radiant Heat Curing .
Radiant heat may be applied by means of pipes circulating steam , hot oil , or hot water , or by electric heating elements .
Provide a suitable enclosure to contain the heat .
Minimize moisture loss by covering all exposed concrete surfaces with plastic sheeting or by applying an approved liquid membrane curing compound to all exposed surfaces .
Uniformly maintain the heat application throughout the extremities of the member .
Apply the same temperature constraints as outlined for low pressure steam curing .
440.03.15 Detensioning .
( a ) Slab Panels .
Do not transfer the tension force to the prestress slab panel until the concrete strength as indicated by cylinder strengths meets the specified transfer strength .
Except to move to storage , ensure that the design strength is met before handling the slab panel or releasing it for shipment .
Prior to detensioning , remove or loosen forms , ties , inserts , hold downs , and other devices that restrict longitudinal movement along the bed , or use a method and sequence to minimize longitudinal movement .
Release prestressing forces using a method that minimizes sudden or shock loading .
Single strand detensioning may be accomplished by heat cutting the strands .
The sequence shall maintain prestressing forces nearly symmetrical around the slab panel ’ s vertical axis .
417 440 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BEAMS AND SLAB PANELS Eccentricity around the vertical axis shall be limited to one strand .
Obtain approval of the cutting pattern prior to use .
Multiple strand detensioning may be accomplished by gradually reducing the force applied to each strand equally and simultaneously .

The schedule for detensioning of beams having deflected steel strands shall incorporate the following : ( 1 ) The manufacturer ’ s sequence of releasing deflected steel strands and uplift points shall be approved .
( 2 ) All hold down devices for deflected steel strands shall be disengaged , and all hold down bolts removed from the beams .
( 3 ) The manufacturer ’ s sequence of releasing the remaining straight steel strands shall be as approved .
All hold down devices may be released prior to release of tension in deflected steel strands if : ( 1 ) The weight of the prestressed beam is more than twice the total of the forces required to hold the steel strands in the low position .
( 2 ) The weight or other approved vertical restraints are applied directly over the hold down points to counteract the uplifting forces , at least until the release of deflected steel strands has proceeded to a point that the residual uplifting forces are less than half the weight of the beam .
Follow all procedures for releasing prestressing forces of deflected steel strands .
Failure to follow these procedures may result in the rejection of the beams .
Adequately separate all beams in storage immediately following removal from the bed to facilitate the repair of surface blemishes and to allow inspection of the finished surfaces .
440.03.16 Camber .
During the period of beam fabrication , select a representative number of beams to be known as “ Camber Control Beams ” , subject to approval .
