13 103-2 CORRECTION OF BID ERRORS 14 The provisions of this article shall apply in waiving irregularities and correcting apparent 15 clerical errors and omissions in the unit bid price and the amount bid for bid items .
16 ( A ) Paper Bid 17 ( 1 ) Omitted Unit Bid Price -- Amount Bid Completed -- Quantity Bid on is One Unit 18 In the case of a bid item for which the amount bid is completed , but the unit bid price 19 is omitted and the quantity shown in the proposal for the bid item is only one unit , 20 the unit bid price shall be deemed to be the same as the amount bid for that bid item 21 and shall constitute the contract unit price for that bid item .
22 ( 2 ) Omitted Unit Bid Price -- Amount Bid Completed -- Quantity Bid on is More Than 23 One Unit 24 In the case of a bid item for which the amount bid is completed ( extension of the unit 25 bid price by the quantity ) but the unit bid price is omitted and the quantity shown in 26 the proposal for the bid item is more than one unit , the unit bid price shall be deemed 27 to be the amount derived by dividing the amount bid for that item by the quantity 28 shown in the proposal for that bid item and shall constitute the contract unit price for 29 that bid item .
30 ( 3 ) Discrepancy in the Unit Bid Price and the Amount Bid 31 In the case of a bid item in which there is a discrepancy between the unit bid price 32 and the extension for the bid item ( amount bid ) , the unit bid price shall govern .
33 As an exception to the above , on bids for contracts not funded with any federal 34 funds , the extension for the bid item ( amount bid ) shall govern when the discrepancy 35 consists of an obvious clerical mistake in the unit bid price consisting of the 36 misplacement of a decimal point .
The correction to the unit bid price will be made 37 only when the following two conditions are met : 38 ( a ) The corrected unit bid price multiplied by the quantity equals the amount bid for 39 the bid item .
40 ( b ) The corrected unit bid price is closer to the average of the engineer 's estimate 41 and the individual bids for the contract item than the uncorrected unit bid price .
42 ( 4 ) Omitted Unit Bid Price and Omitted Amount Bid -- Deemed Zero Bid 43 ( a ) State Funded Projects 44 In the case of omission of the unit bid price and the omission of the amount bid 45 for any one item except Mobilization and , in the case of the omission of the 46 Section 103 1-22 amount bid where a lump sum price is called for , the amount bid and the unit bid 1 price shall be deemed to be zero where the value of the omitted amount bid is 2 1 % or less of the total amount bid for the entire project ( excluding the omitted 3 item ) .
The value of the omitted amount bid will be derived by determining the 4 average of the engineer 's estimate and the individual bids for that contract item .
5 Where the unit bid price is deemed to be zero as provided in this subarticle , such 6 zero unit bid price shall constitute the contract unit price for the affected bid 7 item .
8 Where the amount bid for a lump sum bid item is deemed to be zero except 9 Mobilization , as provided in this subarticle , such zero amount bid shall 10 constitute the contract lump sum price for that bid item .
11 In the case of omission of the amount bid for Mobilization , the bid shall be 12 deemed irregular and may be rejected .
13 ( b ) Federally Funded Projects 14 In the case of omission of the unit bid price and the omission of the amount bid 15 for any one item and , in the case of the omission of the amount bid where 16 a lump sum price is called for , the bid will be considered nonresponsive and will 17 not be considered for award .
18 ( 5 ) Unit Bid Prices Containing More Than Four Decimal Places 19 In the case of a Bid Item for which the amount bid contains more than 4 decimal 20 places for the Unit Bid Price , only the whole number and the first 4 decimal places 21 shall constitute the Contract Unit Price for that Bid Item .
22 ( B ) Electronic Bids 23 ( 1 ) Enter a unit price in schedule of items .
Totals will be generated automatically .
24 ( 2 ) Data incorrectly entered may not be recognized , and the bid item may remain blank 25 until entered correctly .
26 ( 3 ) Enter no more than 4 decimal places for unit price .
27 ( 4 ) Do not enter zero ( 0 ) in any unit price field unless zero is the intended bid for that 28 item .
Zero will be considered a valid bid .
However , where zeros are entered for 29 items that are authorized alternates to those items for which a non-zero bid price has 30 been submitted , zeros will be deemed invalid .
31 ( 5 ) When the proposal allows alternate bids , the bidder shall submit a unit or lump sum 32 price for every item in the proposal other than items that are authorized alternates to 33 those items for which a bid price has been submitted .
Where the bidder submits 34 a unit price other than zero for all items of an authorized alternate , the Department 35 will determine the lowest total price based on the alternate bid .
36 103-3 WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS—MISTAKE 37 ( A ) Criteria for Withdrawal of Bid 38 The Department of Transportation may allow a bidder submitting a bid pursuant to 39 NCGS § 136-28.1 for construction or repair work to withdraw his bid after the scheduled 40 time of bid opening upon a determination that : 41 ( 1 ) A mistake was in fact made in the preparation of the bid .

39 ( C ) Underruns - Increase in Unit Price 40 If the actual quantity of any major contract item underruns the original bid quantity by 41 more than 15 % of such original bid quantity , an increase to the contract unit price , 42 excluding loss of anticipated profit , may be authorized by the Engineer .
Revised contract 43 unit prices pertaining to underruns of major contract items will be applicable to the entire 44 quantity of the contract item that underruns .
No revision will be made to the contract unit 45 price for any minor contract item that underruns the original bid quantities .
46 ( 1 ) Whenever it is anticipated that an underrun in a major contract item in excess of that 47 described above will occur , the Contractor may make written request for a revision 48 to the contract unit price .
If the Engineer and the Contractor are in agreement as to 49 the revision to be made to the contract unit price , then a supplemental agreement 50 covering the revised unit price will be entered into .
If the Engineer and the 51 Section 104 1-34 Contractor are not in agreement , then after performance of the work , a revised unit 1 price may be determined as described below .
2 ( 2 ) Whenever an underrun in a major contract item in excess of the percentage 3 previously set forth has occurred and a supplemental agreement establishing 4 an increase to the contract unit price has not been executed , the Contractor may make 5 written request for a revision to the original contract unit price .
The Contractor shall 6 submit sufficient documentation and analysis of his costs to satisfy the Engineer of 7 any non-recovered costs included in the item that underran .
Any adjustment to the 8 contract unit prices due to underruns will be made by the Engineer based upon his 9 evaluation of the Contractor ’ s documentation and an analysis showing how changes 10 in contract item cost are attributable to the underrun .
An analysis of costs shall be 11 supplemented with the Contractor ’ s documented cost records for work performed on 12 the total quantity of the affected item where the Contractor ’ s request for 13 compensation includes compensation for costs other than recovered fixed costs .
14 The Contractor ’ s cost records shall be complete in every respect and in such form 15 that the Engineer can check them .

The total 20 payment , including any additional compensation granted by the Engineer due to an 21 underrun in a major contract item , shall not exceed the payment that would have 22 been made for the performance of 100 % of the original contract quantity at the 23 original contract unit price .
24 Where non-stock fabricated materials are involved in minor items that underrun or in 25 major items that underrun by less than 15 % , and where fabrication of such material 26 has begun or been completed before the Contractor is advised of the reduction in the 27 quantity of the pay item , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for the 28 verified fabrication cost , including the cost of material less salvage value , or it may 29 instruct the Contractor to have the fabricated material delivered to a site designated 30 by the Engineer and make payment for such material in accordance with 31 Article 109-6 .
32 ( D ) Overruns and Underruns - Reduction In Unit Price 33 Whenever it is anticipated that an overrun or underrun in a major contract item in excess 34 of 15 % or an overrun in a minor contract item in excess of 100 % will occur , the Engineer 35 may make written request for a reduction to the contract unit price .
If the Engineer and 36 the Contractor are in agreement as to the decrease to be made to the contract unit price , 37 a supplemental agreement covering the revised unit price will be consummated before 38 beginning work on that quantity in excess of the allowable percentages .
If the Engineer 39 and the Contractor are not in agreement as to the decrease to be made , the Contractor will 40 be directed to perform the affected work on a force account basis .
Payment for the 41 affected work will be made based upon force account records kept in accordance with 42 Article 109-3 but shall not exceed that payment that would have been made at the 43 original contract unit price .
44 104-6 ELIMINATED CONTRACT ITEMS 45 The Engineer may eliminate any item from the contract , and such action will in no way 46 invalidate the contract .
In the event the item of work involves pre-fabricated materials that 47 are not considered to be stock items and fabrication of such material is begun or completed 48 before the Contractor is advised of the elimination of the contract item , the Department may 49 reimburse the Contractor for the verified fabrication cost including the cost of materials less 50 salvage value or may instruct the Contractor to have the fabricated material delivered to a site 51 Section 104 1-35 designated by the Engineer and make payment for such material in accordance with 1 Article 109-6 .
2 If the Contractor has partially completed a contract item before notification of the elimination 3 of such item , the Department will reimburse the Contractor for the verified actual cost of the 4 partially completed work not to exceed the payment that would have been made at the 5 contract unit or lump sum price for the completed work .
6 No payment will be made for loss of anticipated profits , and no other allowance will be made 7 for eliminated items except as listed above .

7 104-12 VALUE ENGINEERING PROPOSAL 8 This value engineering specification is to provide an incentive to the Contractor to initiate , 9 develop and present to the Department for consideration , any cost reduction proposals 10 conceived by him involving changes to the contract .
This specification does not apply unless 11 the proposal submitted is specifically identified by the Contractor as being presented for 12 consideration as a Value Engineering Proposal ( VEP ) .
Submittals that propose material 13 substitutions of permanent features , such as , but not limited to , changes from rigid to flexible 14 or flexible to rigid pavements , concrete to steel or steel to concrete bridges will not be 15 considered acceptable VEPs .
Depending on the complexity of evaluation and 16 implementations , VEPs that provide for a total savings before distribution of less than 17 $ 10,000 may not be considered .
18 ( A ) Types of Proposals 19 VEPs contemplated are those that would result in a net savings to the Department by 20 providing a decrease in the total cost of construction or reduce the construction time 21 without increasing the cost to construct the project .
The effects the VEP may have on the 22 following items , but not limited to these items , will be considered by the Department 23 when evaluating the VEP : 24 ( 1 ) Service life , 25 ( 2 ) Safety , 26 ( 3 ) Reliability , 27 ( 4 ) Economy of operation , 28 ( 5 ) Ease of maintenance , 29 ( 6 ) Desired aesthetics , 30 ( 7 ) Design , 31 ( 8 ) Standardized features , and 32 ( 9 ) Environmental impact .

Supplemental agreements executed for design-bid-build contracts shall 19 reflect any realized savings in the corresponding line items .
Supplemental agreements 20 executed for design-build contracts shall add one line item deducting the full savings 21 from the total contract price and one line item crediting the Contractor with 50 % of the 22 total VEP savings .
23 The Department reserves the right to include in the supplemental agreement any 24 conditions it deems appropriate for consideration , approval and implementation of the 25 VEP .
Acceptance of the supplemental agreement by the Contractor shall constitute 26 acceptance of such conditions .
27 The final net savings to be distributed will be the difference in cost between the existing 28 contract cost for the involved unit bid items and actual final cost occurring as a result of 29 the modification .
Only those unit bid items directly affected by the supplemental 30 agreement will be considered in making the final determination of net savings .
In 31 determining the estimated net savings , the Department reserves the right to disregard the 32 contract prices if , in the judgment of the Department , such prices do not represent a fair 33 measure of the value of the work to be performed or to be deleted .
Subsequent change 34 documents affecting the modified unit bid items , but not related to the VEP , will be 35 excluded from such determination .
The Department 's review and administrative costs for 36 VEPs will be borne by the Department .
The Contractor 's costs for designs and/or 37 revisions to designs and the preparation of design drawings will be borne by the 38 Contractor .
The costs to either party will not be considered in determining the net 39 savings obtained by implementing the VEP .
The Contractor 's portion of the net savings 40 shall constitute full compensation to him for effecting all changes pursuant to the 41 agreement .
The net savings will be prorated , 50 % to the Contractor and 50 % to the 42 Department , for all accepted VEPs .
43 Upon execution of the supplemental agreement , the Department will thereafter have the 44 right to use , duplicate or disclose , in whole or in part , any data necessary for the use of 45 the modification on other projects without obligation or compensation of any kind to the 46 Contractor .

48 Except as may be otherwise precluded by this specification , the Contractor may submit 49 a previously approved VEP on another project .
50 Section 104 1-43 Unless and until a supplemental agreement is executed and issued by the Department and 1 final plans ( hard copy and electronic ) sealed by an engineer licensed in the State of North 2 Carolina incorporating an approved VEP have been provided to the Resident Engineer 3 and the State Value Management Engineer , the Contractor shall remain obligated to 4 perform the work in accordance with the terms of the existing contract .
5 Acceptance of the modification and its implementation will not modify the completion 6 date of the contract unless specifically provided for in the supplemental agreement .
7 The Contractor shall not be entitled to additional compensation under Section 104 for 8 alterations in the plans or in the details of construction pursuant to the VEP .
9 The Department will not be liable to the Contractor for failure to accept or act upon any 10 VEP nor for any delays to the work attributable to any such VEP .

In this instance the savings will be prorated in accordance 14 with the terms of the negotiated agreement .
15 104-13 RECYCLED PRODUCTS OR SOLID WASTE MATERIALS 16 It is the policy of the Department to aid in reduction of materials that become a part of our 17 solid waste stream .
To that extent the Department encourages contractors to initiate , develop 18 and use products and construction methods that incorporate the use of recycled or solid waste 19 products in the project .
Recycled products or waste materials will be those products or 20 materials that would otherwise become solid waste and are collected , separated , or processed 21 and reused or returned to reuse in the form of raw materials or products that are incorporated 22 into a beneficial reuse on the project .
Targeted materials include , but are not limited to , the 23 following : plastic , glass , paper , cardboard , shingles , tires , fly ash , bottom ash , sludge and 24 construction and demolition debris .
25 This Specification will not be applicable to reclaimed asphalt materials used in accordance 26 with Section 610 and shall not be applicable to any recycled or solid waste materials that are 27 specified for use by the Department on the project .

45 108-7 TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE WORK 46 The Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part by written order 47 for such periods , as he may deem necessary for any of the following reasons : 48 ( A ) Conditions considered unfavorable for the suitable prosecution of the work , or 49 Section 108 1-72 ( B ) The Contractor 's failure to correct conditions unsafe for workmen or the general public , 1 or 2 ( C ) The Contractor has not carried out orders given to him by the Engineer , or 3 ( D ) The Contractor 's failure to perform any provisions of the contract .
4 No extension of the completion date will be allowed for the above suspensions except as may 5 be provided for in Article 108-10 .
6 108-8 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY PROGRESS 7 The Engineer will check the Contractor 's progress at the time each partial pay estimate is 8 prepared .
The Contractor 's progress may be considered as unsatisfactory as follows : 9 ( A ) The Contractor 's progress is found to be less than that described in either count below : 10 ( 1 ) The dollar value of the work completed , excluding material payments allowed by 11 Article 109-5 , is less than the dollar value of the work that should have been 12 completed , on the basis of the Contractor 's approved progress schedule , by more than 13 15 % of the current contract amount .
14 The dollar value of the work completed will be the total estimate to date shown in 15 the latest partial pay estimate , excluding material payments allowed by 16 Article 109-5 .
The current contract amount will be the total amount bid plus 17 accumulated overruns less accumulated underruns shown in the latest partial pay 18 estimate .
19 ( 2 ) The percentage of the work completed is less than the percentage of contract time 20 elapsed on the work by more than 15 % .
The percentage of work completed will be 21 the dollar value of the work completed as defined above , divided by the current 22 contract amount as defined above .
23 The percentage of contract time elapsed will be the number of calendar days elapsed 24 as shown in the latest partial pay estimate divided by the total contract time in 25 calendar days .
26 ( B ) The Contractor fails to begin and pursue the work in accordance with Article 108-1 27 before the expiration of 5 % of the original contract time after the date work was 28 scheduled to begin based upon the approved progress schedule .
29 ( C ) The Engineer anticipates the Contractor will not complete the work described in the 30 contract by the intermediate contract time or the contract completion date .
31 When the Contractor 's progress is found to be unsatisfactory as described in 32 Subarticles 108-8 ( A ) , 108-8 ( B ) and 108-8 ( C ) above , the Engineer may make written demand 33 of the Contractor to state in writing the reason for the unsatisfactory progress and produce 34 such supporting data as the Engineer may require or the Contractor may desire to submit .
The 35 Engineer will consider the justifications submitted by the Contractor and extensions of the 36 completion date have or may be allowed in accordance with Subarticle 108-10 ( B ) .
37 When the Contractor can not satisfactorily justify the unsatisfactory progress , the Engineer 38 may invoke one or more of the following sanctions : 39 ( 1 ) Withhold anticipated liquidated damages from amounts currently due or that become 40 due .
41 ( 2 ) Remove the Contractor from the Department 's Prequalified Bidders List .
42 When any of the above sanctions have been invoked , they shall remain in effect until 43 rescinded by the Engineer .
44 Section 108 1-73 108-9 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT 1 ( A ) Declaration of Default 2 The Department shall have the right to declare default of the contract for breach by the 3 Contractor of any material term or condition of the contract as determined by the 4 Department .

If the Department determines that the Contractor is 34 not in compliance at the end of the time allowed , it may immediately impose any of the 35 corrective actions set forth herein and will advise the Contractor , in writing , with a copy 36 to the Surety of the corrective actions imposed .
37 ( D ) Payment 38 After declaration of default has been made final , the Contractor will be entitled to receive 39 payment for work satisfactorily completed or portions of work satisfactorily completed , 40 less any sums that may be due the Department from the Contractor but in no event shall 41 payment exceed the contract unit or lump sum price for such work .
The Department , at 42 its election , may retain the sum due the Contractor , or any portion thereof , without 43 interest or penalty , until the contract work is completed ; or it may make payment to the 44 Contractor upon declaration of default for work satisfactorily completed to the date that 45 notice of default is received by the Contractor .
The Contractor may be required by the 46 Engineer to carry to a stage of completion satisfactory to the Engineer any work in 47 progress , the value of which , otherwise , would be lost by immediate cessation of work .
48 Payment for such work will be made upon the basis hereinafter set out .
49 In the event that the Contractor 's employees , equipment , or materials are used in 50 prosecution of the work , or any part thereof , after default is declared , payment to the 51 Section 108 1-74 Contractor may be by contract unit or lump sum prices for the work performed , or , if the 1 Engineer determines that such prices do not represent the value of the work performed , 2 payment for the type of work or services performed will be made on a force account 3 basis , as set forth in Article 109-3 , less any sums that may be due the Department ; but in 4 no event shall payment exceed the contract unit or lump sum price for such work or 5 services .
Determination of the method of payment shall be in the sole discretion of the 6 Engineer , and he will advise the Contractor , in writing , of his determination with 7 reference to the specific type of work or service to be performed .
8 If all costs and expenses incurred by the Department arising out of the breach and 9 imposition of sanctions , together with the total cost to the Department of securing the 10 performance of the work set forth in the contract , exceed the sum that would have been 11 payable under the contract , the Contractor and the Surety shall be liable to the 12 Department for such excess and shall pay such amount to the Department .

23 ( F ) Obligation of Contractor and Surety 24 No term or terms of this article and no action taken pursuant hereto by the Department of 25 Transportation , its agents , or employees , will be construed to release or discharge the 26 Contractor or the Surety upon the obligation set forth in the contract bonds , and the 27 Contractor and the Surety shall remain bound thereon unto the Department until the work 28 set forth in the contract has been completed and accepted by the Department and all 29 obligations of the Contractor and the Surety arising under the contract and contract bond 30 have been discharged .
31 ( G ) Provision Not Exclusive 32 The provisions shall be in addition to and not in place of , any other provisions relating to 33 default , breach of contract and sanctions to be imposed in connection therewith appearing 34 in the contract .
35 108-10 CONTRACT TIME AND INTERMEDIATE CONTRACT TIME 36 ( A ) General 37 The contract time will be as defined in Section 101 .
No extensions to the completion 38 date will be authorized except as allowed by this article .
No modifications in the date of 39 availability will be made for any reason whatsoever .
40 Intermediate contract time , as defined in Section 101 will be that as allowed in the 41 contract to complete a part , portion or phase of the total work covered in the contract .
42 Intermediate completion dates and intermediate completion times set forth in the contract 43 may be extended on the same basis as completion dates and as described in this article .
44 When the liquidated damages stipulated in the contract are to be hourly , extensions , as 45 described in this article , will be considered on an hourly basis .
46 Section 108 1-75 ( B ) Completion Date , Intermediate Completion Date and Intermediate Completion 1 Time Extensions 2 No extension of the completion date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate 3 completion time will be allowed for any reason except as provided for below : 4 ( 1 ) If the total dollar value of the final quantities adjusted as provided below , less the 5 dollar value of quantities represented by supplemental agreements that previously 6 extended the completion date , intermediate completion date or intermediate 7 completion time , exceeds the dollar value of the total amount bid , the completion 8 date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time will be extended 9 by the number of calendar days or hours obtained by multiplying the contract time 10 ( days ) , intermediate contract time ( days ) , or intermediate contract time ( hours ) as set 11 forth in the contract by that percentage that such reduced final dollar value exceeds 12 the total amount bid .
The total dollar value of the final quantities for pro-rata 13 computations shall be adjusted by excluding the following : 14 ( a ) Unit bid price changes caused by price adjustments to asphalt cement , 15 ( b ) Fuel adjustments , 16 ( c ) Unit price reductions under Article 105-3 , 17 ( d ) Payment for trainees and 18 ( e ) Unit price changes due to pay factors established by the Standard Specifications .
19 ( 2 ) If supplemental agreements covering the performance of extra work include 20 provisions for an extension of the completion date , intermediate completion date , or 21 intermediate completion time and the final dollar value of the extra work exceeds the 22 estimated dollar value , the number of days or the number of hours by which the 23 completion date , intermediate completion date or intermediate completion time was 24 extended will be increased by the percentage that the final dollar value exceeds the 25 estimated value .
26 ( 3 ) If the Contractor 's current controlling operation is delayed by circumstances 27 originating from work required under the contract and beyond his control and 28 without his fault or negligence , he may , at any time before payment of the final 29 estimate , make a written request to the Engineer on the Contractor Claim Submittal 30 Form , available through the Construction Unit , for an extension of the completion 31 date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time .
This request 32 shall include : 33 ( a ) The circumstances resulting in the alleged delay and documentation of said 34 circumstances as may be required by the Engineer , 35 ( b ) The controlling operation alleged to have been delayed , 36 ( c ) The calendar dates or calendar dates and times on which the controlling 37 operation was delayed and 38 ( d ) The number of calendar days or hours by which he is requesting the completion 39 date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time to be 40 extended .
41 If the Engineer determines that the controlling operation was delayed because of 42 circumstances beyond the control of and without the fault or negligence of the 43 Contractor , and that the Contractor has pursued the work in accordance with 44 Article 108-1 , he will extend the completion date , intermediate completion date , or 45 intermediate completion time unless otherwise precluded by other provisions of the 46 contract .
No extension of the completion date , intermediate completion date , or 47 intermediate completion time will be allowed for delays caused by restrictions , 48 limitations or provisions contained in the contract .
49 Section 108 1-76 Consideration will be given for an extension in the completion date , intermediate 1 completion date , or intermediate completion time involving an intermediate contract 2 time of more than 96 hours if the Contractor 's current controlling operation ( s ) is 3 delayed in excess of 40 % of the total contract time ( days ) , as defined in Section 101 , 4 excluding the time between December 15 and March 16 ; the total intermediate 5 contract time ( days ) , as defined in Section 101 , excluding the time between 6 December 15 and March 16 ; or the total intermediate contract time ( hours ) , as 7 defined in Section 101 ; due to weather or conditions resulting from weather .
No 8 other consideration will be given for extensions in the completion date , intermediate 9 completion date , or intermediate completion time due to delays caused by weather .
10 Where the intermediate contract time is 96 hours or less , no consideration 11 whatsoever will be given for an extension in the intermediate completion time due to 12 weather or conditions resulting from weather .
13 ( 4 ) If changes in the work from that originally contemplated in the contract are ordered 14 by the Engineer and these changes result in reduction in quantities , elimination of 15 items , additional work or extra work , the Engineer will allow an extension in the 16 completion date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time as 17 he may deem warranted by such changes .
Pursuit of the work with adequate forces 18 and equipment and efficiency of the Contractor 's operations will be considered by 19 the Engineer in determining an extension in the completion date , intermediate 20 completion date , or intermediate completion time .
It is , however , the Contractor 's 21 responsibility to show just cause for an extension in the completion date , 22 intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time due to the aforesaid 23 conditions .
If the Contractor elects to file a written claim or requests an extension of 24 contract time , it shall be submitted on the Contractor Claim Submittal Form available 25 through the Construction Unit .
26 ( 5 ) In the event accumulated authorized extensions in the completion date or 27 intermediate completion date resulting from Subarticles 108-10 ( B ) ( 1 ) through 28 108-10 ( B ) ( 4 ) above extend the completion date or intermediate completion date 29 beyond December 15 following expiration of the completion date or intermediate 30 completion date as established in the contract , the completion date will be further 31 extended by the number of calendar days between December 15 of one year and 32 March 16 of the following year .
If any portion of such accumulated authorized 33 extensions are for delays that occurred after the original contract time or intermediate 34 contract time ( days ) expired and during the period between December 15 of one year 35 and March 16 of the following year , this portion of the extension will be deducted 36 from the number of additional calendar days awarded due to extension of the 37 completion date or intermediate completion date beyond December 15 .
38 The Contractor 's claim that insufficient contract time ( days ) , intermediate contract 39 time ( days ) , or intermediate contract time ( hours ) was specified in the contract will 40 not be considered as a valid reason for an extension in the completion date , 41 intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time .
42 When all work on the project is totally complete , with the exception of an item or items on 43 which work is precluded by seasonal limitations set forth in the contract , the Engineer may , 44 provided that the Contractor has , as determined by the Engineer , diligently pursued the work 45 with adequate forces and equipment , waive the assessment of liquidated damages during the 46 period of time from the date all work other than that precluded by seasonal limitations was 47 completed until the date of expiration of the seasonal limitations .
The Contractor shall make 48 the request to waive the assessment of liquidated damages in writing before the beginning 49 date of the requested waiver .
The non-assessment of liquidated damages during the aforesaid 50 period shall not operate to waive any other liquidated damages that may be assessable , or any 51 other terms of the contract .
52 Section 108 1-77 108-11 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 1 The parties acknowledge that time is of the essence for the performance of the work under the 2 contract .
Time is an essential element of the contract .
Delay in completing the work will 3 result in damages including but not limited to public inconvenience , obstruction to traffic , 4 interference with business and the increasing of engineering , inspection and administrative 5 costs to the Department .
It is therefore agreed that in view of the difficulty of making a 6 precise determination of such damages , a sum of money in the amount stipulated in the 7 contract , will be charged against the Contractor for each calendar day , each hour , or portion 8 thereof that the work , or any portion of the work as described in the contract , remains 9 uncompleted after the expiration of the completion date , intermediate completion date , or 10 intermediate completion time shown in the contract , not as a penalty but as liquidated 11 damages .
12 Should the Contractor or , in case of default , the Surety fail to complete the work or any 13 portion of the work by any of the applicable completion dates , intermediate completion dates , 14 or intermediate completion times shown in the contract , a deduction of the amount stipulated 15 in the contract as liquidated damages will be made for each and every calendar day , for each 16 and every hour , or portion thereof that the work or any portion of the work remains 17 uncompleted after the expiration of any completion date , intermediate completion date , or 18 intermediate completion time applicable to the uncompleted work .
This amount will be 19 deducted from any money due the Contractor or his Surety under the contract and the 20 Contractor and his Surety will be liable for any liquidated damages in excess of the 21 amount due .
22 In the event that the contract establishes one or more intermediate completion dates or times 23 in addition to the completion date , each of the liquidated damages stipulated will be 24 considered to be cumulative to any other liquidated damages stipulated .
25 In case of Contractor default of the contract and the completion of the work by the 26 Department , the Contractor and his Surety will be liable for the liquidated damages under the 27 contract , but no liquidated damages will be chargeable for any delay in the final completion of 28 the work by the Department due to any action , negligence , omission , or delay of the 29 Department .
30 In any suit for the collection of or involving the assessment of liquidated damages , the 31 reasonableness of the amount stipulated in the contract will be presumed .
The liquidated 32 damages referred to herein are intended to be and are cumulative and will be in addition to 33 every other remedy now or hereafter enforceable at law by statute or under the contract .
34 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part thereof after the 35 expiration of the completion date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion 36 time shall in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights 37 under this contract .
38 108-12 EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME AND APPORTIONMENT OF 39 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 40 In accordance with Articles 108-10 and 108-11 , when a contract is not completed by the 41 completion date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time , the 42 Contractor shall be entitled to an extension of the completion date , intermediate completion 43 date , or intermediate completion time and apportionment and remittance of liquidated 44 damages to the extent that the failure to complete was due to the conditions set forth in 45 Article 108-10 .
The Contractor , however , shall be entitled to an extension of the completion 46 date , intermediate completion date , or intermediate completion time , or an apportionment and 47 remittance of liquidated damages only to the extent and in the proportion that such delays 48 were caused by the conditions set forth in Article 108-10 , and it is understood that any 49 extension granted shall not operate to waive any liquidated damages or any claim which the 50 Department has or may have against the Contractor by reason of failure of the Contractor to 51 Section 108 1-78 complete the said contract by the completion date , intermediate completion date , or 1 intermediate completion time specified therein or as revised by authorized extensions .

After reviewing the submitted cost records 5 and the submitted documentation , the Engineer will make such adjustments as he 6 deems warranted .
7 ( 3 ) Upon request from the Contractor , materials meeting the requirements of the contract 8 that were to have been incorporated into the work or were to remain the property of 9 the Department but are not used in the work will be paid in accordance with 10 Article 109-6 .
11 ( 4 ) No claim for loss of anticipated profits will be considered and no payment will be 12 made for loss of anticipated profits .
13 ( 5 ) Termination of a contract shall not relieve the Contractor of his responsibilities for 14 any completed portion of the work , nor shall it relieve his Surety of its obligation for 15 and concerning any just claims arising out of the work performed .
16 108-14 TERMINATION OF CONTRACTOR 'S RESPONSIBILITY 17 After the project has been completed and accepted , as provided for in Article 105-17 , the 18 Contractor 's responsibility will cease except as provided in Article 107-20 and as set forth in 19 his contract bonds or any warranties provided for under the contract .
The Contractor shall 20 remain responsible for any amounts determined to be owed the Department in the processing 21 of the final estimate and such amounts shall be paid by the Contractor upon notification by the 22 Department before processing of the final estimate .
23 SECTION 109 24 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT 25 109-1 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES 26 All work completed under the contract will be measured by the Engineer according to United 27 States standard measures unless otherwise stated in the contract .
28 The method of measurement and computations used in the determination of quantities of 29 material furnished and of work performed under the contract will be those methods generally 30 recognized as conforming to accepted engineering practice .
31 The terms “ gauge ” and “ thickness , ” when used in connection with the measurement of plates , 32 sheets and steel wire , shall be applied as follows : 33 Item Test Method Uncoated Steel Sheets and Light Plates United States Standard Gauge Galvanized Sheets AASHTO M 218 or M 167 Aluminum Sheets AASHTO M 196 or M 197 Steel Wire AASHTO M 32 The term “ ton ” will mean short ton ( mass ) consisting of 2,000 pounds .
34 Trucks used to haul material being paid by weight will be either weighed empty before each 35 loading or weighed empty daily .
When trucks are weighed empty daily , each truck shall be 36 weighed before hauling its first load of the day and shall bear a legible identification mark .
37 Where aggregates that are to be paid by weight have been stockpiled after being produced , 38 measurement for purposes of payment will be made after the aggregates have been loaded on 39 trucks for direct delivery to the project .
40 Section 109 1-80 When a complete structure or structural unit , as may be indicated by the unit , lump sum or 1 each , is specified as the unit of measurement , the unit will be construed to include all 2 necessary fittings and accessories .
3 When standard manufactured items are specified , and these items are identified by gauge , unit 4 weight , section dimensions or other dimensions , such identification will be considered to be 5 nominal weights or dimensions .
Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited 6 specifications , manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be 7 accepted .
8 109-2 SCOPE OF PAYMENT 9 The Contractor shall receive and accept payment provided for in the contract as full payment 10 for furnishing all materials and performing all work under the contract in a complete and 11 acceptable manner and for all risk , loss , damage , or expense of whatever character arising out 12 of the nature of the work or the prosecution thereof , subject to the requirements of 13 Article 107-20 .
Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of the 14 various items that are completed and accepted in accordance with the terms of the contract .
15 If the Measurement and Payment clause in the specifications relating to any unit price or lump 16 sum price in the bid schedule requires that the said unit price or lump sum price cover and be 17 considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the item , this same work or 18 material will not be measured or paid under any other pay item that may appear elsewhere in 19 the contract .
20 109-3 FORCE ACCOUNT WORK 21 All force account work shall be performed as directed by the Engineer including the numbers 22 and types of equipment , the numbers and classifications of labor and foremen and material 23 requirements .
24 All work to be paid on a force account basis shall be paid in the following manner : 25 ( A ) Labor 26 For all authorized labor and foremen in direct charge of the specific operations , the 27 Contractor will receive the rate of base ( actual ) wages ( or scale ) actually being paid by 28 the contractor for each hour that the labor and foremen are actually engaged in the 29 specific force account work .
30 In addition to reimbursement for each hour that the labor and foremen are actually 31 engaged in the specific force account work , the Contractor may receive compensation for 32 travel time to and from the project if and only if the labor and foremen needed are outside 33 a 75 mile radius as included in Subarticle 109-3 ( B ) .
The base location will be established 34 and approved by the Engineer before performing the specific force account work .
If the 35 approved labor and foremen travel to another project upon completion of the specific 36 force account work , payment for travel time may not exceed the travel time that would 37 have been required to return to the point of origin in accordance with 38 Subarticle 109-3 ( B ) .
When travel time is approved by the Engineer , it shall be included 39 in the total hours approved and worked for that specific week .
The Engineer will approve 40 the mode of travel .
41 Before beginning the specific force account work , the Contractor will submit in writing 42 for the Engineer ’ s approval a list of all wage rates applicable to the work .
Approval will 43 not be granted where these wage rates are not actually representative of wages being paid 44 elsewhere on the project for comparable classes of labor performing similar work .
45 Section 109 1-81 Payment for overtime will be allowed when approved by the Engineer before performing 1 the specific force account work .
Overtime for labor and foremen will be paid based on 2 the company ’ s policy for overtime payment .
Verification of such payment will be 3 tracked by submission of weekly payrolls as required on federal projects and as requested 4 on all other projects .
Failure to submit payrolls as required or requested shall act as a bar 5 to the Contractor for payment of overtime for labor and foremen .
If the labor or foremen 6 is employed partly on specific force account work and partly on other work , the amount 7 of overtime to be reimbursed will be prorated based upon the number of hours worked on 8 the specific force account work during the payroll period .
9 An additive amount equal to the Contractor ’ s actual labor burden rate , up to a maximum 10 of 60 % , will be paid to the Contractor for all base ( actual ) wages paid to labor and 11 foremen for the specific force account work .
No additive will be provided for overtime 12 payments .
The labor burden rates will include costs associated with the employee ’ s 13 actual base wages benefits , including Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) , 14 unemployment contributions , Social Security and Medicare taxes and company fringe 15 benefits .
Company fringe benefits are the actual costs paid to , or on behalf of , workers 16 by reason of health and welfare benefits , pension fund benefits , or other benefits , when 17 such amounts are required by prevailing wage laws generally applicable to the classes of 18 labor employed on the work .

The average terminal price is the average of the Freight on Board ( F.O.B . )
price for 32 diesel fuel at the terminals in Charlotte , Wilmington and Selma , North Carolina .
When the 33 average terminal price fluctuates upward or downward from the Base Index Price , an amount 34 will be added to or deducted from the monies due the Contractor as follows .
35 The current quantity for the specified contract items for which partial payment is made will be 36 multiplied by the respective Diesel Fuel Usage Factor contained in the contract to determine 37 the theoretical diesel fuel usage for each specified contract item .
The sum of the theoretical 38 diesel fuel usage for all specified contract items will be multiplied by the algebraic difference 39 between the average F.O.B .
price for diesel fuel at the above specified terminals and the Base 40 Index Price contained in the contract to determine the fuel price adjustment to be made on the 41 partial payment estimate .
42 Section 109 1-88 The following formula will be used to calculate the appropriate payment or credit on the 1 estimate : 2 S = ( ) ( ) ∑ − QF B A Where : S = Fuel Price Adjustment for Partial Payment B = Base Index Price A = Average Terminal Price Q = Partial Payment Quantity for Contract Item F = Fuel Factor for Contract Item The average terminal price in effect on the first day of the month in which the partial payment 3 period ends will be used to make payment adjustments for fuel whether or not more than one 4 price fluctuation has occurred within a single partial payment period .
5 The Engineer 's estimate of quantities for contract items measured by cross sections shall be 6 used on the various partial payment estimates to determine fuel price adjustments .
When the 7 Engineer determines after payment for all or a portion of such contract item that is subject to 8 a fuel price adjustment that the total quantity of work paid to date will be adjusted to reflect 9 more accurate quantity determinations , the Engineer will make a pro rata increase or decrease 10 in the fuel price adjustment proportionate to the adjustment in the total quantity of work paid .
11 The prorated fuel price adjustment for the contract item will be determined by multiplying the 12 cumulative fuel price adjustment made for that contract item for the previous estimate period 13 by the adjusted quantity for that contract item and divided by the total quantity of work paid 14 for the previous estimates for the contract item .
Payment for the prorated fuel price 15 adjustment will be made accordingly on the partial payment estimate that includes the 16 adjustment in the quantity of work paid .
17 109-9 FINAL PAYMENT 18 Upon completion of the final estimate assembly , the Engineer will notify the Contractor 19 giving the final quantities and the apparent liquidated damages , if any are assessed .
After the 20 Contractor reviews the final quantities and submits the documents listed in Article 109-10 , the 21 entire sum found to be due after deducting all previous payments and all amounts to be 22 retained or deducted under the requirements of the contract will be paid to the Contractor .

35 ( D ) Any other documents that are required by the contract such as reports , statements and 36 other information necessary for compliance with applicable labor regulations of the 37 FHWA .
38 Section 150 1-89 Submission of false information in the documents required by this section shall be a basis for 1 disqualifying the Contractor from further bidding in accordance with Article 102-15 .
If the 2 Contractor fails to submit the required documentation within the timeframe specified by the 3 Department , the Department may consider the Contractor to be nonresponsive and may 4 process the final estimate .
5 109-11 INTEREST ON FINAL PAYMENT 6 Should final payment on a project not be made within 120 calendar days after the project final 7 acceptance date , interest , at the average rate earned by the State Treasurer on the investment 8 within the State 's Short Term Investment Fund during the month preceding the date interest 9 becomes payable , will be paid to the Contractor on the final payment for the period beginning 10 on the 121st day after final acceptance and extending to the date the final estimate is paid , 11 provided that the documents required by Article 109-10 have been submitted within 12 30 calendar days of the mailing of the notification outlined in Article 109-9 .

10 Perform density sampling and testing on all pavements as outlined in Sections 10.4 and 11 10.6 of the Asphalt QMS Manual unless otherwise approved .
12 Perform the sampling and testing at the minimum test frequencies as specified .
If the 13 density testing frequency fails to meet the minimum frequency as specified , all mix 14 without the required density test representation will be unsatisfactory .
The Engineer will 15 evaluate if the mix may remain in place in accordance with Article 105-3 .
16 ( B ) Limited Production Procedures 17 Define “ resurfacing ” as the first new uniform layer placed on an existing pavement .
18 Proceed on limited production when , for the same mix type and on the same contract , one 19 of the following conditions occur ( except as noted below ) .
20 ( 1 ) Two consecutive failing lots , except on resurfacing , 21 ( 2 ) Three consecutive failing lots on resurfacing , or 22 ( 3 ) Two consecutive failing density gauge control strips .
23 As exceptions to the above , pavement within each construction category ( New and 24 Other ) , as defined in Section 10.3.3 of the Asphalt QMS Manual , and pavement placed 25 simultaneously by multiple paving crews will be evaluated independently for limited 26 production purposes .
27 Limited production is defined as the production , placement and compaction of a 28 sufficient quantity of mix to construct a 300 feet control strip plus 100 feet of pavement 29 adjacent to each end of the control strip .
30 Remain on limited production until such time as satisfactory density results are attained 31 or until two control strips have been attempted without achieving acceptable density test 32 results .
If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory density after two control strips have 33 been attempted , cease production of that mix type until such time as the cause of the 34 failing density test results can be determined .
As an exception , the Engineer may grant 35 approval to produce a different mix design of the same mix type if Quality Control and 36 Quality Assurance plant mix test indicate the failing densities are attributed to the mix 37 problem ( s ) rather than compaction related problems and limited production startup would 38 Section 609 6-13 not be required .
The determination of whether a mix problem exists at this time will be 1 made by QA personnel .
2 If the Contractor does not operate by the limited production procedures when conditions 3 as specified in Section 10.9 of the Asphalt QMS Manual , all mix produced thereafter will 4 be unacceptable .
Remove this material and replace with material that complies with the 5 Standard Specifications , at no additional cost to the Department .

Size , uniformly grade and 4 combine the several aggregate fractions in such proportions that the resulting mixture 5 meets the grading and physical requirements of the Specifications for the specified mix 6 type .
Materials that will not produce a mixture within the design criteria required by the 7 Specifications will be rejected , unless otherwise approved .
8 At least 10 days before start of asphalt mix production , submit the mix design and 9 proposed JMF targets for each required mix type and combination of aggregates to the 10 Engineer for review and approval .
Prepare the mix design using a Department certified 11 mix design technician in an approved mix design laboratory and in accordance with the 12 procedures outlined in Section 4.5 of the Asphalt QMS Manual .
13 For the final surface layer of the specified mix type , use a mix design with an aggregate 14 blend gradation above the maximum density line on the 2.36 mm and larger sieves .
15 The Contractor has the option to use a recycled plant mix in lieu of virgin plant mix .
16 However , all provisions of the Specifications for virgin mixes apply to recycled mixes .
17 This means that the same design criteria tests , test frequencies , and quality control 18 requirements will apply .
19 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement ( RAP ) or Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles ( RAS ) may be 20 incorporated into asphalt plant mixes in accordance with Article 1012-1 and the 21 following applicable requirements .
However , use of RAP materials is not allowed in 22 Open Graded Friction Course ( OGFC ) mixes or Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing Course 23 ( UBWC ) mixes .
Use of RAS materials is not allowed in Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing 24 Course ( UBWC ) mixes .
25 RAS material may constitute up to 6 % by weight of total mixture , except for Open 26 Graded Friction Course ( OGFC ) mixes , which are limited to 5 % RAS by weight of total 27 mixture .
Also , when the percentage of RAP is greater than 30 % by weight of total 28 mixture , use Fractionated RAP ( FRAP ) meeting the requirements of Subarticle 1012- 29 1 ( F ) ( c ) .
30 When RAP , RAS , or a combination of both is used in asphalt mixtures , the recycled 31 binder replacement percentage ( RBR % ) shall not exceed the amounts specified in Table 32 610-4 for the mix type .
For recycled mixtures , the virgin binder Performance Grade ( PG ) 33 grade to be used is specified in Table 610-5 for the mix type based on the recycled binder 34 replacement percentage ( RBR % ) .
35 If the Contractor wishes to submit mix designs containing recycled material amounts 36 exceeding the specified maximums , additional testing will be required to verify the 37 Performance Grade ( PG ) of the reclaimed binder .
Also , the Contractor has the option to 38 have additional testing performed to determine if the mix can be approved using a virgin 39 binder grade different than specified in Table 610-5 .
The Engineer will determine if the 40 binder grade is acceptable for use based on the test data submitted with the mix design .
If 41 the mix design is acceptable , the Engineer will establish and approve the grade and 42 percentage of virgin asphalt binder to be used .
43 If a change in the source of RAP or RAS be made , a new mix design and JMF may be 44 required in accordance with Article 1012-1 .
Samples of the completed recycled mixture 45 may be taken by the Department on a random basis to determine the PG grading on the 46 recovered asphalt binder in accordance with AASHTO M 320 .
If the grading is 47 determined to be a value other than required for the specified mix type , the Engineer may 48 require the Contractor to adjust any combination of the grade , the percentage of 49 Section 610 6-17 additional asphalt binder or the blend of reclaimed material to bring the grade to the 1 specified value .
2 ( B ) Mix Design Criteria 3 Design and produce asphalt concrete mixtures that conform to the gradation requirements 4 and design criteria in Table 610-2 and Table 610-3 for the mix type specified .
The mix 5 type designates the nominal maximum aggregate size and the design traffic level .
6 Surface mix designs will be tested by the Department for rutting susceptibility .
Rut depth 7 requirements for each surface mix type and traffic level are specified in Table 610-3 .
8 Mix designs that fail to meet these requirements will be unacceptable and shall be 9 redesigned by the Contractor such that rut depths are acceptable .
10 Table 610-2 provides gradation control points to be adhered to in the development of the 11 design aggregate structure for each mix type .
Aggregate gradations shall be equal to or 12 pass between the control points .
Table 610-3 provides the mix design criteria for the 13 various mix types .
14 Use an anti-strip additive in all asphalt mixes .
It may be hydrated lime or a chemical 15 additive or a combination of both as needed to meet the retained strength requirements as 16 specified in Table 610-3 .
When a chemical additive is used , add at a rate of not less than 17 0.25 % by weight of binder in the mix , or as approved by the Engineer .
When hydrated 18 lime is used , add at a rate of not less than 1.0 % by weight of the total dry aggregate .
19 ( C ) Job Mix Formula ( JMF ) 20 Establish the JMF gradation target values within the design criteria specified for the 21 particular type of asphalt mixture to be produced .
Establish the JMF asphalt binder 22 content at the percentage that will produce voids in total mix ( VTM ) at the midpoint of 23 the specification design range for VTM , unless otherwise approved .
The formula for 24 each mixture will establish the following : blend percentage of each aggregate fraction , 25 the percentage of reclaimed aggregate , if applicable , a single percentage of combined 26 aggregate passing each required sieve size , the total percentage and grade of asphalt 27 binder required for the mixture ( by weight of total mixture ) , the percentage and grade of 28 asphalt binder to be added to the mixture ( for recycled mixtures ) , the percentage of 29 chemical anti-strip additive to be added to the asphalt binder or percentage of hydrated 30 lime to be added to the aggregate , the temperature at that the mixture is to be discharged 31 from the plant , the required field density and other volumetric properties .
32 When WMA is used , document the additive or process used and recommended rate on 33 the JMF submittal .
Verify the JMF based on plant produced mixture from the trial batch .
34 The mixing temperature at the asphalt plant will be established on the JMF .
The JMF 35 mix temperature shall be within the ranges shown in Table 610-1 unless otherwise 36 approved .
37 TABLE 610-1 MIXING TEMPERATURE AT THE ASPHALT PLANT Binder Grade JMF Temperature PG 58-28 ; PG 64-22 250 - 290°F PG 70-22 275 - 305°F PG 76-22 300 - 325°F When using RAP or RAS with a different binder than specified , use mixing temperatures 38 in Table 610-1 based on the original binder grade for that mix type shown in Table 610-3 .
39 When RAS is used , the JMF mix temperature shall be established at 275°F or higher .
40 Have on hand at the asphalt plant the approved mix design and JMF issued by the 41 Department , before beginning the work .
42 Section 610 6-18 The JMF for each mixture will remain in effect until modified in writing , provided the 1 results of QMS tests performed in accordance with Section 609 on material currently 2 being produced conform with specification requirements .
When a change in sources of 3 aggregate materials is to be made , a new mix design and JMF will be required before the 4 new mixture is produced .
When a change in sources of RAP or RAS material is to be 5 made , a new JMF is required and a new mix design may be required .
When 6 unsatisfactory results or other conditions make it necessary , the Engineer may revoke the 7 existing JMF or establish a new JMF .

8 When directed due to unsatisfactory laydown or workmanship , operate under the limited 9 production procedures .
Limited production for unsatisfactory laydown is defined as being 10 restricted to the production , placement , compaction and final surface testing ( if applicable ) of 11 a sufficient quantity of mix necessary to construct only 2,500 feet of pavement at the laydown 12 width .
13 Remain on limited production until such time as satisfactory laydown results are obtained or 14 until three consecutive 2,500 feet sections have been attempted without achieving satisfactory 15 laydown results .
If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory laydown results after 16 three consecutive 2,500 feet sections have been attempted , cease production of that mix type 17 until such time as the cause of the unsatisfactory laydown results can be determined .
18 As an exception , the Engineer may grant approval to produce a different mix design of the 19 same mix type if the cause is related to mix problems rather than laydown procedures .
20 Mix placed under the limited production procedures for unsatisfactory laydown or 21 workmanship will be evaluated for acceptance in accordance with Article 105-3 .
22 Each pavement layer will be tested by the Contractor and the Engineer using a 10 foot 23 stationary straightedge furnished by the Contractor .
Any location on the pavement selected 24 by the Department shall be tested as well as all transverse joints .
Apply the straightedge 25 parallel to the centerline of the surface .
Do not exceed 1/8 inch variation of the surface being 26 tested from the edge of the straightedge between any two contact points .

28 ( B ) Option 2 - North Carolina Hearne Straightedge 29 Push the straightedge manually over the pavement at a speed not exceeding 2 miles per 30 hour .
For all lanes , take profiles in the right wheel path approximately 3 feet from the 31 right edge of pavement in the same direction as the paving operation , unless otherwise 32 approved due to traffic control or safety considerations .
As an exception , lanes adjacent 33 to curb and gutter , expressway gutter , or shoulder berm gutter may be tested in the left 34 wheel path .
Make one pass of the straightedge in each full width travel lane .
The full 35 lane width should be comparable in ride quality to the area evaluated with the Hearne 36 Straightedge .
If deviations exist at other locations across the lane width , use a 10 foot 37 non-mobile straightedge or the Hearne Straightedge to evaluate which areas may require 38 corrective action .
Take profiles as soon as practical after the pavement has been rolled 39 and compacted , but no later than 24 hours following placement of the pavement , unless 40 otherwise authorized by the Engineer .

9 Copies of this procedure may be obtained from the Department 's Pavement Section in the 10 Construction Unit .
11 Plot the straightedge graph at a horizontal scale of approximately 25 feet per inch with 12 the vertical scale plotted at a true scale .
Record station numbers and references ( bridges , 13 approach slabs , culverts , etc . )
on the graphs .
Distances between references/stations shall 14 not exceed 100 feet .
Have the operator record the Date , Project No. , Lane Location , 15 Wheel Path Location , Type Mix and Operator ’ s Name on the graph .
16 Upon completion of each day 's testing , evaluate the graph , calculate the Cumulative 17 Straightedge Index ( CSI ) and determine which lots , if any , require corrective action .
18 Document the evaluation of each lot on a QA/QC-7 form .
Submit the graphs along with 19 the completed QA/QC-7 forms to the Engineer , within 24 hours after profiles are 20 completed , for verification of the results .
The Engineer will furnish results of their 21 acceptance evaluation to the Contractor within 48 hours of receiving the graphs .
In the 22 event of discrepancies , the Engineer ’ s evaluation of the graphs will prevail for acceptance 23 purposes .
The Engineer will retain all graphs and forms .
24 Use blanking bands of 0.2 inch , 0.3 inch and 0.4 inch to evaluate the graph for 25 acceptance .
The 0.2 inch and 0.3 inch blanking bands are used to determine the 26 Straightedge Index ( SEI ) , which is a number that indicates the deviations that exceed 27 each of the 0.2 inch and 0.3 inch bands within a 100 foot test section .
The Cumulative 28 Straightedge Index ( CSI ) is a number representing the total of the SEIs for one lot , which 29 consist of not more than 25 consecutive test sections .
In addition , the 0.4 inch blanking 30 band is used to further evaluate deviations on an individual basis .
The CSI will be 31 determined by the Engineer in accordance with the current procedure titled North 32 Carolina Hearne Straightedge - Calibration and Determination of Cumulative 33 Straightedge Index .
34 The pavement will be accepted for surface smoothness on a lot by lot basis .
A test 35 section represents pavement one travel lane wide not more than 100 feet in length .
A lot 36 will consist of 25 consecutive test sections , except that separate lots will be established 37 for each travel lane , unless otherwise approved by the Engineer .
In addition , full width 38 acceleration or deceleration lanes , ramps , turn lanes and collector lanes will be evaluated 39 as separate lots .
For any lot that is less than 2,500 feet in length , the applicable pay 40 adjustment incentive will be prorated on the basis of the actual lot length .
For any lot 41 which is less than 2,500 feet in length , the applicable pay adjustment disincentive will be 42 the full amount for a lot , regardless of the lot length .
43 If during the evaluation of the graphs , five lots require corrective action , then proceed on 44 limited production for unsatisfactory laydown in accordance with Article 610-12 .
45 Proceeding on limited production is based upon the Contractor ’ s initial evaluation of the 46 straightedge test results and shall begin immediately upon obtaining those results .
47 Additionally , the Engineer may direct the Contractor to proceed on limited production in 48 accordance with Article 610-12 due to unsatisfactory laydown or workmanship .
49 Section 610 6-29 Limited production for unsatisfactory laydown is defined as being restricted to the 1 production , placement , compaction and final surface testing of a sufficient quantity of 2 mix necessary to construct only 2,500 feet of pavement at the laydown width .
Once this 3 lot is complete , the final surface testing graphs will be evaluated jointly by the Contractor 4 and the Engineer .
Remain on limited production until such time as acceptable laydown 5 results are obtained or until three consecutive 2,500 foot sections have been attempted 6 without achieving acceptable laydown results .
The Engineer will determine if normal 7 production may resume based upon the CSI for the limited production lot and any 8 adjustments to the equipment , placement methods , and/or personnel performing the work .
9 Once on limited production , the Engineer may require the Contractor to evaluate the 10 smoothness of the previous asphalt layer and take appropriate action to reduce and/or 11 eliminate corrective measures on the final surface course .
Additionally , the Contractor 12 may be required to demonstrate acceptable laydown techniques off the project limits 13 before proceeding on the project .
14 If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory laydown results after three consecutive 15 2,500 foot sections have been attempted , cease production of that mix type until such 16 time as the cause of the unsatisfactory laydown results can be determined .
17 As an exception , the Engineer may grant approval to produce a different mix design of 18 the same mix type if the cause is related to mix problem ( s ) rather than laydown 19 procedures .
If production of a new mix design is allowed , proceed under the limited 20 production procedures detailed above .
21 After initially proceeding under limited production , the Contractor shall immediately 22 notify the Engineer if any additional lot on the project requires corrective action .
The 23 Engineer will determine if limited production procedures are warranted for continued 24 production .
25 If the Contractor does not operate by the limited production procedures as specified 26 above , the 5 lots , which require corrective action , will be considered unacceptable and 27 may be subject to removal and replacement .
Mix placed under the limited production 28 procedures for unsatisfactory laydown will be evaluated for acceptance in accordance 29 with Article l05-3 .

11 Horizontal translation is defined as difference in the actual dowel bar location from its 12 theoretical position as detailed in the standard details .
The maximum allowable 13 horizontal translation is 2 inches .
14 Vertical translation ( depth ) is the difference in the actual dowel bar location from the 15 theoretical midpoint of the slab .
The maximum allowable vertical translation is 1/2 inch 16 higher than the theoretical midpoint and 1inch lower than the theoretical midpoint .
17 Dowel bar misalignment , either vertical tilt or horizontal skew is defined as the difference 18 in position of the dowel bar ends with respect to each other .
Vertical tilt is measured in 19 the vertical axis whereas horizontal skew is measured in the horizontal axis .
20 If a dowel bar inserter is used , determine a joint score for each joint scanned .
The joint 21 score is a measure of the combined effects from the dowel ’ s horizontal skew or vertical 22 tilt .

31 ( B ) Areas such as ramps or auxiliary lanes where the total width is less than 2 lanes .
32 710-6 FINISHING 33 Screed and float finish the concrete to the required cross section that minimizes or eliminates 34 hand finishing .
Additional water for finishing will not be allowed .
Hand finishing will not be 35 permitted except under the following conditions : 36 ( A ) Narrow widths or irregular areas , where operation of mechanical equipment is 37 impractical .
38 Section 710 7-13 ( B ) If a breakdown of mechanical equipment occurs , hand methods may be used to finish 1 only that concrete deposited on the base before the breakdown .
2 ( C ) Abnormal circumstances of short duration subject to approval .
3 Produce a final finish on the pavement surface true to grade and uniform in appearance and 4 free of irregular , rough or porous areas .
5 Following the finishing of the pavement by screeding , floating and checking with 6 straightedges , further finish the surface of the pavement by burlap dragging or other 7 acceptable method to produce a uniform surface texture .
Pull the burlap drag in a longitudinal 8 direction .
9 Produce the final surface finish on all mainline pavement , auxiliary lanes , and ramps by 10 mechanical equipment for longitudinally tined grooves while the concrete is plastic .
The 11 tining shall be done with a mechanical device such as a wire comb .
The comb shall have a 12 single row of tines .
Each shall have a nominal width of 5/56 inch to 1/8 inch .
The nominal 13 spacing of the tines shall be 3/4 ± 1/8 inch center-to-center .
The nominal depth of tined 14 groove in the plastic concrete shall be 1/8 ± 1/32 inch .
15 Longitudinal tining shall be accomplished by equipment with automated horizontal and 16 vertical controls to ensure straight , uniform depth tined grooves .

If abutting pavement is not to be placed , the 6 inch area 24 nearest the edge or 1 foot from the face of the curb shall not be tined .
Hand-operated tining 25 equipment that produces an equivalent texture may be used only on small or irregularly 26 shaped areas .
Tines shall be thoroughly cleaned at the end of each day ’ s use and damaged or 27 worn tines replaced .
28 When surface corrections for pavement smoothness are made in the hardened concrete , no 29 additional texturing is required .
30 After final finishing , hand finishing may be required on the edges of pavement and joints 31 whenever irregularities in surface texture or alignment occur .
Care should be taken in hand 32 finishing pavement edges to avoid ridges or high places that will prevent water from draining 33 out of the transverse grooves .
34 The use of excessive water during the finishing operations will not be permitted .
35 Provide a textured surface with an average texture depth of 0.8 mm as tested in accordance 36 with ASTM E965 with no single test having a texture depth of 0.5 mm or less .
Perform4 37 randomly located tests in accordance with ASTM E965 within the initial pavement lot of each 38 mobilization in the presence of the Engineer .
A “ lot ” is defined in Article 710-4 .
If the 39 average of the 4 tests does not meet the above criteria , make appropriate changes to the 40 surface texture operations and test the next lot as detailed above .
Once the surface texture 41 process is established to meet minimum texture requirements , maintain consistency within the 42 operation to provide the above minimum texture depth .
Perform additional sand patch tests in 43 accordance with ASTM E965 when directed .
44 If the surface texture becomes damaged or reduced by rain or any other action , reestablish or 45 restore surface texture by an approved method .

25 Operate the Inertial Profiler in the direction of the final traffic pattern .
Collect IRI data from 26 both wheel paths during the same run .
It is permissible to collect data one wheel path at a 27 time if each wheel path is tested and evaluated separately .
Define a “ wheel path ” as the 3 feet 28 from the edge of the travel lane .
MRI values are the average of the IRI values from both 29 wheel paths .
When using an inertial profiler that collects a single trace per pass , take care to 30 ensure that the measurements from each trace in a travel lane start and stop at the same 31 longitudinal locations .
Unless otherwise specified , multiple runs are not necessary for data 32 collection .
33 Operate the automatic triggering method at all times unless impractical .
A tape stripe or 34 traffic cone wrapped with reflective material may be used to alert the profiler ’ s automatic 35 triggering sensor to begin data collection .
The profiler shall reach the intended operating 36 speed before entering the test section .
The runup and runout distances should be sufficient to 37 obtain the intended operating speed and to slow down after testing is completed .

Use the same marking procedure as for station numbers .
35 710-9 THICKNESS TOLERANCES 36 A lot for thickness acceptance testing is defined in Article 710-4 .
37 To establish an adjusted unit price , if appropriate , for mainline pavement , take one 4 38 inch diameter core from each lot at a random location as directed .
Other areas such as 39 intersections , entrances , crossovers and ramps will each be considered as one lot and the 40 thickness of each of these lots will be determined separately .
Small irregular areas may be 41 included as part of another lot .
Take one core for each 1,333.3 sy of pavement or fraction 42 thereof in the lot .
43 Section 710 7-17 When the measurement of any core , original core or additional cores taken to calculate the 1 average , is less than the plan thickness by more than 1.0 inch , the extent of the removal area 2 due to thickness deficiency will be determined by taking additional exploratory cores at 3 approximately 10 foot intervals parallel to the center line in each direction from the deficient 4 core until an exploratory core is found in each direction which is within 1.0 inch of the plan 5 thickness .
The pavement between these exploratory cores will be removed full lane width 6 wide and replaced with concrete of the thickness shown on the plans .
Exploratory cores for 7 deficient thickness will not be used in averages for adjusted unit price .

6 1072-10 STRAIGHTNESS , CAMBER AND DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES 7 ( A ) General 8 Ensure that rolled material , before being laid out or fabricated , is straight .
9 If straightening is necessary , use methods that do not damage the metal .
Kinks or sharp 10 bends are cause for rejection of the material .
11 Ensure that heat straightened parts are substantially free from external forces , except 12 those resulting from mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat .

Perform V-type 9 heating by the carefully planned and supervised application of a limited amount of 10 localized heat .
11 When minor corrections in camber are required , use small localized heats limited to 12 the flange material .
Perform major corrections in camber by V-type heating to 13 prevent web distortion .
14 Begin heating at the apex of the heating pattern and progress slowly towards the base 15 of the pattern as each area is brought up to temperature as stated in 16 Subarticle 1072-10 ( D ) ( 5 ) .
Do not progress the heating torches toward the base of 17 the heating pattern until the apex of the pattern is brought up to the specified 18 temperature .
Do not return the heating torch toward the apex of the heating triangle 19 after heating has progressed towards the base .
Continue heating to successive areas 20 until the base of the triangular heating pattern is brought up to the required 21 temperature across the full width of the flange .
22 ( 2 ) Heat Cambering of Rolled Beams 23 Heat cambering of rolled beams is allowed to provide the required vertical curvature .
24 Space triangular heating patterns throughout the length of the member to provide the 25 required curvature .
Locate the apex of the heating triangle at a point not less 26 than 75 % of the depth of the member measured from the flange that is concave after 27 cambering .
Limit the total included angle of the heating pattern to 20° .
28 Weld all detail material such as connection plates , bearing stiffeners and gusset 29 plates attached to the member to the rolled beam after the beam is cambered as 30 required .
31 ( 3 ) Heat Cambering of Welded Plate Girders 32 Heat cambering of welded plate girders is only permitted when approved in writing 33 as a necessary repair procedure for plate girders rejected for camber deviation .
34 When it is necessary to correct camber deviation in welded plate girders , heating is 35 permitted in V-type heating patterns centered on intermediate stiffeners and 36 connection plates .
Where necessary , add stiffeners for this purpose if approved .
37 Section 1072 10-104 Locate the apex of the heating pattern not less than 3/4 of the depth of the member 1 from the flange that is shortened after cooling .
The maximum included angle of the 2 heating pattern is 10° .
The maximum width of the base of the heating pattern is 10 3 inches .
Where shallow members or thin webs prescribe heating patterns with a 4 width substantially less than 10 inches at the junction of the web to flange , extend 5 the heating pattern in the flange at that location beyond the limits of the heating 6 pattern in the web by no more than 1 inch provided the total width of pattern in the 7 flange does not exceed the 10 inch limit stated above .
8 ( 4 ) Support of Members for Heat Cambering 9 Heat camber members with the web vertical and supports spaced to take the 10 maximum advantage of dead load in the member before applying heat .
Ensure all 11 supports are approved by the Department ’ s inspector before beginning work .
12 Do not place any combination of support system or external load on the member that 13 causes a compressive stress in the flange to exceed 20,000 psi before heating for 14 AASHTO M 270 Grades 36 , 50 and 50W steels .
15 ( 5 ) Heating Process and Equipment 16 Confine heating to the patterns described herein and conduct to bring the steel within 17 the planned pattern to a temperature between 1,100°F and 1,150°F as rapidly as 18 possible without overheating the steel .
19 Any heating procedure which causes a portion of the steel to exceed a temperature 20 greater than 1,150°F is destructive heating and is automatically cause for rejection of 21 the steel .
Steel rejected for destructive heating is investigated for re-acceptance , 22 repair or replacement if allowed by the Engineer .
Bear the cost of such tests and any 23 necessary repair or replacement .
24 ( 6 ) Heat Measurement 25 Specified temperatures are checked using portable digital pyrometers or temperature 26 indicating crayon .
When using a temperature indicating crayon , the following 27 procedure shall be employed ; mark on the surface of metal or sheet with the required 28 crayon .
Once the surface reaches the rated temperature of the crayon , the mark will 29 melt and show liquid smear appearance .
At this point , the heating operation shall 30 cease to prevent overheating .
Exceeding the specified temperature is strictly 31 prohibited .
32 ( E ) Heat Curving Girders 33 ( 1 ) Type of Heating 34 With approval , use continuous or V-type heating methods to curve girders .
For the 35 continuous method , simultaneously heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom 36 flanges that is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature .
37 For V-type heating , heat the top and bottom flanges simultaneously in truncated 38 triangular or wedge-shaped areas .
Position the areas with their base along the flange 39 edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange .
Set the spacing and 40 temperatures to approximate the required curvature by a series of short chords .
Heat 41 along the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate .
42 For V-type heating , terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the 43 inside flange surface just before the juncture of the web and flange .
To avoid web 44 distortion , make certain that heat is not applied directly to the web when heating the 45 inside flange surfaces ( the surfaces that intersect the web ) .
Extend the apex of the 46 truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the 47 juncture of the flange and web .
Use an included angle of approximately 15° to 30° 48 in the truncated triangular pattern , but do not allow the base of the triangle to 49 Section 1072 10-105 exceed 10 inches .
Vary the patterns prescribed above only with the Engineer ’ s 1 approval .
2 For both types of heating , heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the 3 horizontal curve after cooling .
Concurrently heat both inside and outside flange 4 surfaces for flange thicknesses of 1.25 inches and greater .
Adhere to the temperature 5 requirements presented below .
6 ( 2 ) Temperature 7 Conduct the heat curving operation so the temperature of the steel never exceeds 8 1,150°F as measured by temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means .
Do 9 not artificially cool the girder until it naturally cools to 600°F .
Below 600°F , use dry 10 compressed air to artificially cool the girder .
11 ( 3 ) Position for Heating 12 Heat-curving the girder with the web in either a vertical or horizontal position is 13 permitted .
When curved in the vertical position , brace or support the girder so the 14 tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heat-curving process does not 15 cause the girder to overturn .
16 When curved in the horizontal position , support the girder near its ends and at 17 intermediate points , if required , to obtain a uniform curvature .
Do not allow the 18 bending stress in the flanges to exceed 27,000 psi .
To prevent a sudden sag due to 19 plastic flange buckling when the girder is positioned horizontally for heating , place 20 intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within 2 inches of the 21 flanges at all times during the heating process .
22 ( 4 ) Sequence of Operations 23 Conduct the heat-curving operation either before or after completing all the required 24 welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners to the web .
However , unless provisions 25 are made for shrinkage , position and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners 26 after heat-curving .
In any event , weld the stiffeners , connection plates , and bearing 27 stiffeners to the girder flanges after the member is curved .
If longitudinal stiffeners 28 are required , heat-curve or oxygen-cut these stiffeners separately before welding to 29 the curved girder .
30 ( 5 ) Camber and Curvature 31 Camber the girders before heat-curving .
Cut the web to the prescribed camber 32 allowing for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat-curving .
If approved , 33 a carefully supervised application of heat is permitted to correct moderate deviations 34 from the specified camber .
35 Horizontal curvature and vertical camber is measured for final acceptance after all 36 welding and heating operations are complete and the flanges have cooled to 37 a uniform temperature .
Horizontal curvature is checked with the web in the vertical 38 position by measuring offsets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by 39 using other suitable means .
Camber is checked with the web in the horizontal 40 position .
Camber the girder so it meets the horizontal and vertical curvature 41 ordinates without inducing stress into the girders by mechanical force .
42 Compensate for loss of camber in the heat-curved girders as residual stresses 43 dissipate during service life of the structure .
Compute this anticipated loss of camber 44 in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications .
45 Section 1072 10-106 ( 6 ) Procedure Specification and Shop Drawings 1 Submit structural steel shop drawings , including a detailed written procedure 2 specification for heat curving the girders , supplemented by calculations and sketches , 3 for review , comments and acceptance .
On the shop drawings , indicate the type , 4 location and spacing of heat sectors , if used , supports and catch blocking for each 5 field section of girders .
Include suitable blocking diagrams for measuring horizontal 6 curvature similar to those usually prepared for camber and vertical curvature .
7 ( F ) Camber Measurement 8 At the time of acceptance at the shop and after erection , ensure that all stringers and 9 girders for bridges meet the required camber values within the tolerances specified in 10 Subarticle 1072-10 ( G ) .
Follow the procedure for measuring camber as outlined below : 11 ( 1 ) Assemble the member at the shop as specified in Article 1072-19 and measure with 12 the member lying on its side .
13 ( 2 ) Camber repairs are only allowed when approved by the Engineer .
Camber deviation 14 is judged irreparable if corrective measures in the shop produce web buckling in 15 excess of the specified tolerance , in which case the member is rejected .
16 ( 3 ) The final camber measurement is made by the Engineer in the field after erection .
17 At the time of this measurement , ensure that the members have all of the specified 18 camber less the dead load deflection of the steel as specified in 19 Subarticle 1072-10 ( G ) .

42 10 43 Section 1072 10-107 Deviation from specified camber of erected steel bridge superstructures measured when 1 the steel work is complete and the superstructure is subject to steel dead load stresses only 2 is limited to : 3 -0 ; 4 +1/8 '' x No .
of ft from nearest bearing , up to 1 '' maximum .
5 10 6 If the plans do not require shop induced camber , provide an actual member that is straight 7 or one of the following : 8 ( 1 ) If natural camber `` turned up '' is required , the maximum plus camber is the algebraic 9 sum of the allowable deviation , dead load deflection , vertical curve ordinate and 10 superelevation ordinate ; 11 ( 2 ) If natural camber ‘ turned down '' is required , the maximum negative camber is equal 12 to the algebraic sum of the dead load deflection , vertical curve ordinate and 13 superelevation ordinate .
14 Do not exceed 1/8 inch per 10 foot length for the actual deviation from curvature shown 15 in the plans .
16 1072-11 OXYGEN CUTTING 17 Oxygen cutting of structural steel is allowed , provided a smooth surface free from cracks and 18 notches is secured and an accurate profile is secured by the use of a mechanical guide .
Hand 19 cut only where approved and grind smooth leaving no burnt edges .
20 In all oxygen cutting , adjust and manipulate the cutting agent to avoid cutting beyond ( inside ) 21 the prescribed lines .

Ensure that both of these 20 averages meet or exceed the required release strength and the lowest cylinder is 21 not more than 200 psi below the required strength .
22 Test a set of three cylinders from each end to determine the 28 day compressive 23 strength .
The strengths from the dead end cylinders are averaged and the 24 strengths from the live end cylinders are averaged .
Ensure that both of these 25 averages meet or exceed the 28 day compressive strength .
Ensure that no 26 cylinder indicates a compressive strength less than 400 psi less than the required 27 28 day compressive strength .
Failure to meet the above requirements is cause 28 for rejection of the members represented .
29 ( C ) Temperature Requirements 30 Maintain a concrete temperature at the time of placing in the forms between 50°F 31 and 95°F .
32 Do not place concrete when the air temperature , measured at the location of the 33 concreting operation in the shade away from artificial heat , is below 35°F .

C-20.0 with the exception of concrete used in prestressed members .
7 Test prestressed members as follows : 8 The Department will perform the complete C-21.0 Field Test Procedure for the Nitrite 9 Ion in Plastic Concrete on plastic concrete samples obtained randomly from a truck used 10 to pour concrete near each end ( live end and dead end ) of a prestressed concrete casting .
11 Powder samples will be taken from hardened cylinders made at the time C-21.0 is run for 12 any concrete that fails the C-21.0 ( plastic test ) method .
The Chemical Testing Laboratory 13 will test the powder using method C-20.0 Determination of Nitrite in Hardened Concrete .
14 Acceptance of the concrete is dependent in the results of method C-20.0 ( hardened test ) 15 when any sample fails the C-21.0 ( plastic test method ) .
16 The Department will perform a qualitative nitrite ion check by method C-22.0 ( Field Spot 17 Test ) on each load of concrete batched for a prestressed concrete casting bed .
18 Acceptance of the concrete is dependent on the results of method C-20.0 ( hardened test ) 19 when any sample fails the C-22.0 ( Field Spot Test ) .
The producer may elect to not 20 incorporate concrete that fails Method C-22.0 ( Field Spot Test ) instead of waiting 21 for C-20.0 ( hardened test ) test results to determine the acceptability of the member .
Once 22 per each week ’ s production of prestressed concrete with corrosion inhibitor , random 23 samples of hardened concrete powder will be taken from cylinders used for 24 method C-21.0 ( plastic test ) .
These samples will be submitted to the Chemical Testing 25 Laboratory for analysis using method C-20.0 ( hardened test ) .
26 Units with calcium nitrite in a quantity less than specified are subject to rejection .
27 Furnish powder drilled from concrete cylinders to the Engineer , in a quantity to be 28 specified , to verify the concentrations of calcium nitrite in hardened concrete .
Concrete 29 failing to contain calcium nitrite at the required concentrations as tested is subject to 30 rejection .
31 Use only air-entraining , water-reducing and/or set-controlling admixtures in the 32 production of concrete mixtures that are compatible with calcium nitrite solutions .
33 Strictly adhere to the manufacturer ’ s written recommendations regarding the use of 34 admixtures including storage , transportation and method of mixing .
If preferred , use 35 calcium nitrite , which acts as an accelerator , in conjunction with a retarder to control the 36 set of concrete , as per the manufacturer ’ s recommendation .

36 Section 1078 10-137 ( K ) Ready Mixed Concrete Plant 1 Ensure ready mixed concrete plants are inspected and approved by the Department before 2 they are used to produce concrete for the project .
Ensure that plants meet all applicable 3 requirements of the Standard Specifications and in addition have at least two acceptable 4 concrete delivery vehicles that are in working condition .
Plants approved by the 5 Department are placed on a list of approved plants that is made available .
All plants are 6 subject to reinspection at intervals selected by the Engineer .
Reapproval after each 7 inspection is contingent on continuing compliance with the Standard Specifications 8 1078-5 CASTING BED AND FORMS 9 Use metal forms , including headers or end forms , except where other materials are approved 10 by the Engineer .
Use forms of adequate thickness , braced , stiffened , anchored and aligned 11 adequately to consistently produce members within the limits of dimensional tolerances .
12 Design and align the forms so they do not restrict longitudinal movement of the casting when 13 the prestressing force is transferred .
Provide corners and angles that are chamfered or 14 rounded .
Provide joints in forms that are smooth and tight enough to prevent leakage of 15 mortar .
Plug holes and slots in forms , pallets , headers and bulkheads neatly to prevent 16 leakage of mortar .
Make the inside surfaces of forms accessible for cleaning .
Thoroughly 17 clean the beds and forms after each use .
Before casting , clean the inside surfaces of the forms 18 from rust , grease or other foreign matter .
Remove all foreign substances from inside the 19 forms , including any standing water .
Do not allow coatings used for release of members to 20 build up .
Do not use forms that do not present a smooth surface .
21 When casting holes through the top flange of Bulb Tee Girders for overhang or interior bay 22 falsework hanger rods , use rigid PVC conduits with a wall thickness of approximately 23 1/8 inch .
Do not use thin wall material .
Secure conduits in the forms so they do not migrate 24 out of the proper location .
Other methods of forming holes may be proposed but are subject 25 to the Engineer ’ s approval .
26 When casting dowel rod holes in cored slab or box beam members , use material that creates 27 round , vertical holes of the specified diameter and in the correct location .
Do not use material 28 that deforms , collapses or shifts position during casting of the member .
29 Apply form release agents to the forms either before or after stringing of strands .
If applied 30 before stringing , provide a release agent of a type that dries to a degree so it can not 31 contaminate any strand that comes in contact with it .
If the release agent is applied after 32 stringing , exercise great care and provide a sheet metal or similar type shield for protection of 33 the strands .
34 1078-6 TENSIONING DEVICES 35 Use tensioning devices adequate to produce and maintain the required tension in all strands 36 until the concrete reaches the required transfer strength .
Equip all jacks with accurate and 37 calibrated gauges for registering jacking loads .
Calibrate gauges with the jacks with which 38 they are used .
Calibrate all jacks and gauges by an approved testing company at no cost to the 39 Department at intervals not to exceed 12 months .
During progress of the work , if gauge 40 readings and elongations indicate materially differing loads , recalibrate as required .
Use 41 gauges with a full load capacity of 1 1/2 to 2 times their normal working load , unless 42 otherwise approved .
Do not use loads less than one-fourth or more than 3/4 of the total 43 graduated gauge capacity unless calibration data clearly establishes consistent accuracy over 44 a wider range .
Use gauges with indicating dials at least 6 inches in diameter and gauge 45 pointers that do not fluctuate , preventing an accurate reading , but remain steady until the 46 jacking load is released .
Ensure that all gauges have an accuracy of reading within 2 % .
47 Provide means for measuring the elongation of strands within 1/4 inch .
48 Section 1078 10-138 1078-7 PLACING STRANDS , TIES AND REINFORCING STEEL 1 Position strands , ties , supports , reinforcing bars of the sizes shown in the plans and bearing 2 plates in accordance with the detailed dimensions shown in the plans and effectively secure 3 against displacement from their correct positions .
The use of previously tensioned strands is 4 not permitted .
For prestressing strands , do not allow deflections or displacements of any kind 5 between the end anchorages unless shown in the plans .
Place the steel reinforcing in final 6 position after tensioning of the strands .
Bend all tie wires to the inside of the member so the 7 ends are farther from the edge than the material tied .
Support bottom strands spacings not to 8 exceed 20 feet by supports meeting Article 1070-4 or by other approved means .
Plastic 9 supports may be used when approved .
10 Strands with kinks , bends , nicks , scale , excessive rust or other defects are not permitted .
No 11 more than one broken wire per casting bed is permitted .
Slight rusting is not cause for 12 rejection , provided it is not sufficient to cause visible pits .
Take precautions to prevent 13 contamination of strands and reinforcing steel .
Clean the strands and reinforcing steel to an 14 acceptable condition before pouring concrete .
Do not place concrete in the forms until the 15 strand and reinforcement condition and arrangement are inspected by the plant inspector .
16 Strand splices are only permitted at the end of a reel and when using a single strand jack .
17 Ensure that the strand lengths to be spliced together have the same lay of wire to avoid 18 unraveling and position the splice so it does not fall within a member .
Do not torch cut the 19 ends of the spliced strand lengths .
Cut by shears , abrasive grinders or other means approved 20 by the Engineer .
No more than one strand splice per bed is allowed on an individual strand 21 and the use of previously tensioned strands for splicing is not permitted .
22 Where debonding of strands is required , accomplish by encasing the strand in a tubular 23 conduit capable of resisting the pressure exerted by the concrete .
Do not use slit conduit .
Use 24 a conduit of HDPE or polypropylene with a minimum wall thickness of 0.025 inch .
Ensure 25 that the inside diameter of the conduit is of sufficient size to allow free movement of the 26 encased strand but not greater than the diameter of the strand plus 1/8 inch .
Secure the 27 conduit so longitudinal movement along the strand is prevented , and bonding of the strand is 28 prevented at the required location ± 1 inch .
Prevent concrete from entering the conduit by 29 taping .
Use tape manufactured from a non-corrosive material compatible with the concrete , 30 conduit and steel .
31 1078-8 TENSIONING PROCEDURE 32 A producer quality control representative shall be present during strand tensioning .
Tension 33 each strand to the load shown in the plans before placing the concrete .
34 Measure the load induced in the prestressing strand both by jacking gauges and strand 35 elongations on at least the first five strands and every third strand thereafter on each pour .
36 Measure loads on all other strands by either jacking gauges or strand elongations .
When both 37 methods of measurement are used , if a discrepancy between gauge and elongation of more 38 than 5 % is apparent , carefully check the entire operation and determine the source of error 39 before proceeding .
Make appropriate allowances in the computed elongation and jacking 40 loads for load losses due to friction and all possible slippage or relaxation of the anchorage .
41 Establish references periodically at each strand anchorage to indicate any yielding or slippage 42 that may occur between the time of initial tensioning and final release of the strands .
43 In determining the applied load by measuring the elongation of the strand , use a modulus of 44 elasticity taken from the typical stress-strain curve for the brand , size and type of strand 45 tensioned .
Submit stress-strain curve data for the actual heats of material used in the strands 46 to the plant inspector before using the strands .
Identify each reel or strand by tagging in 47 accordance with AASHTO M 203 .
Mark the outer layer of each reel pack of strand with a 48 wide color band .
In addition , attach a metal tag to each reel pack labeled in accordance with 49 AASHTO M 203 .
50 Section 1078 10-139 Tension strands in a group or individually .
Before full tensioning , bring each strand to 1 an initial tension of 2,000 lbs .
for all beds under 150 feet in length , 3,000 lbs .
for all beds 2 150 feet to 300 feet in length and 4,000 lbs .
for all beds longer than 300 feet in length .
3 Measure this initial tension by a calibrated gauge or other approved means , and then compute 4 the elongation due to initial tensioning .
Use the difference between the required final tension 5 and the initial tension to compute the expected additional elongation .
6 For precast prestressed deck panels , use a final prestressing force of 14,000 lbs .
per strand for 7 Grade 250 strand and 16,100 lbs .
per strand for Grade 270 strand .
8 After initial tensioning , tension the strands until the required elongation and jacking load are 9 attained and reconciled within the limits specified above .
Keep a permanent record of the 10 initial jacking load , the final jacking load , and the elongation produced thereby .
11 In single strand tensioning , rotation of the jacking ram is not allowed .
12 When draped strands are used , submit the bed layout showing the method of draping and 13 tensioning the draped strands and also calculations determining the loads required for 14 tensioning the draped strands .
Drape the strands for all members to be cast in any one 15 tensioning operation before casting any beam .
Have end templates or bulkheads at ends of 16 beams remain vertical or as otherwise shown in the plans .
Perform draping for all members 17 either simultaneously or in single or incremental lifts beginning at the center of the bed and 18 working outward toward each end of the bed .
Complete tensioning in the fully draped 19 position is not allowed unless approved in writing .
20 Use round steel rollers of a type and dimensions approved by the Engineer for deflecting the 21 draped strands .
Round the part in contact with the strand to a diameter of not less than 22 3/4 inch .
Use support and hold-down devices of sufficient rigidity with adequate support so 23 the final position of the strands is as shown in the plans .
24 With strands tensioned in accordance with the above requirements and with other 25 reinforcement in place , cast the concrete members so as to achieve the required lengths .
26 Maintain strand load between anchorages until the concrete reaches the required compressive 27 strength for transfer of load from the anchorages to the members .
28 For personnel engaged in the tensioning operation , provide protection by effective shields 29 adequate to stop a flying strand .
Provide shields produced from steel , reinforced concrete , 30 heavy timbers and other approved material at both ends of the bed .
31 1078-9 PLACING CONCRETE 32 Place concrete in accordance with Article 1077-8 and the additional requirements of this 33 article .
34 Upon completion of stressing strand , place concrete within a reasonable time to prevent 35 contamination of the strands and reinforcing steel .
36 Place concrete for girders 54 inches or less in height , and concrete for all cored slabs and box 37 beams , in two or more equal horizontal layers .
Place concrete for girders over 54 inches in 38 height in three horizontal layers .
When placing concrete in three layers locate the top of the 39 first layer approximately at the top of the bottom flange and locate the top of the second layer 40 approximately at the top of the web .
To prevent separation of surfaces between layers , do not 41 allow the time between successive placements onto previously placed concrete to exceed 42 20 minutes , unless the previously placed concrete has not yet stiffened , as evidenced by the 43 continuous effective use of vibration .
Should shrinkage or settlement cracks occur , the 44 Engineer reserves the right to require additional layers and/or vibration .
45 The requirement of the above paragraph may be waived with the permission of the Engineer if 46 self-consolidating concrete is used .
47 Internal or a combination of internal and external vibration is required as is necessary to 48 produce uniformly dense concrete without honeycomb .
49 Section 1078 10-140 Place concrete in cold weather in accordance with Article 420-7 .
1 Place concrete in daylight unless an adequate lighting system meeting the approval of the 2 Engineer is provided .
3 Do not exceed a temperature of 95°F in the freshly mixed concrete when placed in the forms .
4 Place the concrete in the bed in one continuous operation , finishing each member before 5 proceeding to the next one .
If the pour stops before the concrete in all the members in the bed 6 is placed , start curing immediately .
Do not place concrete in any remaining members in that 7 bed setup once curing at elevated temperatures has begun .
8 When cored slabs and box beams are cast , employ an internal hold-down system to prevent 9 the voids from moving .
At least 6 weeks before casting cored slabs or box beams , submit to 10 the Engineer for review and comment , detailed drawings of the proposed void material and 11 hold-down system .
In addition to structural details , indicate the location and spacing of the 12 holds-downs .
Submit the proposed method of concrete placement and of consolidating the 13 concrete under the void .
14 1078-10 CURING CONCRETE 15 ( A ) General 16 Cure concrete by steam curing , radiant heat curing or water curing , as set forth below .
17 As an option , cure concrete for prestressed piles with membrane curing compound as set 18 forth below .
Use a method or methods that prevent the concrete from losing moisture at 19 any time before curing is complete .
Use methods that do not deface or injure the 20 concrete .
Use curing procedures that prevent cracks from occurring in the members .
21 Cure all members in any one bed by the same method .
22 Continue the curing period until the concrete reaches sufficient strength to permit transfer 23 of load from the anchorage to the members .
As soon as the concrete attains release 24 strength , immediately release all forms in a continuous operation , without delay for other 25 activities such as the cleaning of forms .
Immediately following the removal of the forms , 26 de-tension the members .
27 ( B ) Curing at Elevated Temperatures 28 Perform radiant heat curing under a suitable enclosure that contains the heat and prevent 29 moisture loss .
Apply moisture by a cover of moist burlap , cotton matting , or similar 30 approved material .
Retain moisture by covering the member with an approved waterproof 31 sheeting in combination with an insulating cover .
Support the cover at a sufficient 32 distance above the member being cured to allow circulation of the heat .
33 Provide steam curing enclosures essentially free of steam leakage to minimize moisture 34 and heat losses .
Do not allow the enclosure to come in contact with the members or 35 forms for the members .
Do not direct steam jets on the forms so as to cause localized 36 high temperatures .
37 After placing and vibrating , allow the concrete to attain its initial set before the 38 application of heat or steam .
The concrete is considered to obtain its initial set when it 39 has a penetration resistance of at least 500 psi when tested in accordance with 40 AASHTO T 197 .
Take the sample of concrete tested for penetration resistance from the 41 last load cast in the bed .
Store the sample of concrete with the precast member and 42 maintain in the same condition and environment as the member except for the periods of 43 time necessary to prepare the test specimen and to perform the penetration resistance test .
44 Conduct the penetration resistance test .
45 Section 1078 10-141 As an option , submit data indicating that an approved concrete mix attains its initial set 1 after some particular time period .
Different periods may be required for different weather 2 conditions .
If such data is submitted , consideration is given to permitting heat or steam 3 introduced after the time indicated by such data instead of having to perform the 4 penetration resistance test .
Consideration is given to determining the time of initial set by 5 methods other than AASHTO T 197 provided data supporting such other methods is 6 submitted .
7 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F , cover the forms after the placement of 8 concrete and apply sufficient heat to maintain the temperature of the air surrounding the 9 unit between 50° and 70°F .
10 When the ambient air temperature is above 70°F , start a water cure as set forth below or 11 other approved method as soon as the concrete is able to receive the water without 12 physical damage to its surface .
Discontinuation of the cure is allowed upon introduction 13 of steam , provided that a relative humidity of 100 % is maintained .
14 The temperature within the curing enclosure shall not exceed 160°F .
15 Maintain a relatively uniform rate of increase of the temperature within the curing 16 enclosure of approximately 40°F per hour , not to exceed 15°F per 15 minutes .
Ensure 17 that the temperature increase is relatively uniform throughout the length and on both 18 sides and top of the concrete unit .
Place recording thermometers within 50 feet of each 19 end of the bed and at points not to exceed 100 feet between the end thermometers .
20 Provide at least two thermometers for bed lengths of 100 feet or less .
Calibrate recording 21 thermometers at intervals not to exceed 6 months .
Ensure that the temperature differential 22 within the curing enclosure does not exceed 15°F .
Submit complete temperature records 23 for all cures before final approval of the members .
24 Continue steam curing until the concrete reaches the required transfer strength .
25 ( C ) Water Curing 26 Keep the concrete continuously wet by the application of water as soon as possible 27 without damage to the concrete surface , and before the concrete obtains an initial set of 28 500 psi .
Apply the water using soaker hoses and wet burlap or other approved means for 29 the full length of each member .
Apply water evenly along the entire length of the bed .
30 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F cover the forms after the placement of 31 the concrete and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the temperature 32 of the air surrounding the member between 50°F and 70°F .
After the concrete obtains 33 an initial set of 500 psi , the air temperature surrounding the member is allowed to 34 increase to 100°F while continually maintaining moisture on the surface of the concrete .
35 Whenever heat is applied to the member , place temperature recording clocks on the bed 36 as required when curing at elevated temperatures .
The requirements for rate of 37 temperature increase apply .
38 Maintain the application of heat ( if used ) and water until the concrete obtains release 39 strength .
40 ( D ) Curing with Membrane Curing Compound 41 As an option , cure prestressed concrete piles with a membrane curing compound .
Spray 42 the entire surface of the concrete uniformly with a wax-free , resin-base curing compound 43 conforming to Article 1026-2 .
Use clear curing compound to which a fugitive dye is 44 added for color contrast .
45 Section 1078 10-142 Apply the membrane curing compound after the surface finishing is complete , and 1 immediately after the free surface moisture disappears .
In the event the application of 2 curing compound is delayed , start another curing method immediately and continue until 3 the application of the curing compound is started or resumed or until the concrete reaches 4 the required detensioning strength .
5 Seal the surface with a single uniform coating of the specified type of curing compound 6 applied at the rate of coverage recommended by the manufacturer or as directed by the 7 Engineer , but not less than one gallon per 150 sf of area .
8 At the time of use , thoroughly mix the compound in a condition with the pigment 9 uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle .
If the application of the compound does not 10 result in satisfactory coverage , stop the method and apply water curing , as set out above , 11 until the cause of the defective work is corrected .
12 At locations where the coating shows discontinuities , pinholes , or other defects , or if rain 13 falls on the newly coated surface before the film dries sufficiently to resist damage , apply 14 an additional coat of the compound immediately after the rain stops at the same rate 15 specified herein .
16 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F , cover the forms after the application of 17 the curing compound and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the 18 temperature of the air surrounding the member between 50°F and 70°F .
Whenever heat 19 is applied to the members , place recording thermometers on the bed as required when 20 curing at elevated temperatures .
The requirements for rate of temperature increase also 21 apply .
22 Completely remove any curing compound adhering to a surface to which new concrete is 23 bonded by sandblasting , steel wire brushes , bush hammers or other approved means .
24 Protect the concrete surfaces to which the compound is applied from abrasion or other 25 damage that results in perforation of the membrane film until the concrete achieves 26 design strength and the members are de-tensioned .
27 1078-11 TRANSFER OF LOAD 28 A producer quality control representative or equivalent qualified personnel shall be present 29 during removal of forms and during transfer of load .
30 Transfer load from the anchorages to the members when the concrete reaches the required 31 compressive strength shown in the plans .
Loosen and remove all formwork in one continuous 32 operation as quickly as possible as soon as release strength is obtained .
As soon as the forms 33 are removed , and after the Department ’ s Inspector has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect 34 the member , transfer the load from the anchorages to the members as quickly as possible in 35 one continuous operation using the approved detensioning sequence .
36 For any particular group of members cast in the same bed , do not transfer the load to any 37 concrete until the test cylinder breaks indicate that the concrete in all these members has 38 reached the required strength as outlined in Subarticle 1078-4 ( B ) ( 3 ) .
If these conditions are 39 not met , delay the transfer of the prestressing load to the concrete until tests of additional 40 cylinders show that the required strength is reached .
41 When curing at elevated temperatures , begin the procedures for transferring prestressing load 42 immediately after curing is discontinued and the forms are released , and while the concrete is 43 still hot to prevent cooling shrinkage and cracking .
If so directed by the Engineer , cover 44 members or otherwise protect so as to cool the concrete slowly after release to prevent 45 thermal shock and the evaporation of moisture in the members .
46 Section 1078 10-143 Transfer load to not cause cracks in members .
Transfer load by gradual release of the strands 1 as a group , by gradual release of part of the group , or by burning the fully tensioned strands at 2 the ends of the members .
If intending to release the strands by a method other than gradual 3 release of the entire group , submit six copies of the proposed method and pattern of release , if 4 not so shown in the plans , for approval .
Rigidly follow the approved method and pattern of 5 release .
When the fully tensioned strands are burned , burn each strand or group of strands 6 simultaneously at each end of the bed in its indicated order in the pattern and at each end of 7 each member before proceeding to the strands in the next group in the pattern at any point .
8 Because of the critical nature of the bond development length in prestressed concrete panel 9 construction , if transferring of stress by burning the fully tensioned strands at the ends of the 10 member , burn each strand first at the ends of the bed and then at each end of each member 11 before proceeding to the next strand in the burning pattern .
12 When detensioning all girders , box beams , cored slabs , piles , and panels do not burn strands 13 quickly but heat with a low oxygen flame played along the strand for at least 5 inches until the 14 metal gradually loses its strength .
Apply heat at such a rate that failure of the first wire in 15 each strand does not occur until at least 5 seconds after heat is first applied .
When 16 detensioning other members , follow the above procedure unless an alternate procedure is 17 approved .
Detensioning by arc welder is not allowed .
18 Incorporate the following in the method for single strand detensioning of members having 19 draped strands : 20 ( A ) Release the pair of straight strands located in the uppermost position in the lower flange 21 first .
22 ( B ) Then release the tension in the draped strands at the ends and uplift points in accordance 23 with an approved pattern .
24 ( C ) Disengage all hold-down devices for draped strands and release the hold-downs .
25 ( D ) Then release the pair of straight strands located in the upper flange .
26 ( E ) Release the remaining straight strands of the pattern in accordance with an approved 27 sequence .
28 ( F ) Release all strands in a manner meeting the Engineer ’ s approval that will cause 29 a minimum shock and lateral eccentricity of loading .
30 Failure to follow the above procedures for transfer of load is ground for rejection of the 31 members involved .
32 1078-12 VERTICAL CRACKS IN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE GIRDERS BEFORE 33 DETENSIONING 34 This section addresses prestressed concrete members that have vertical casting cracks before 35 strand detensioning .
Certain types of these cracks have been determined by the Department to 36 render the girders unacceptable .
37 Unacceptable cracked members are those with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a 38 distance less than the member depth which extend into the bottom flange .
Such members are 39 not serviceable and will be rejected .
Members with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a 40 distance less than the member depth but do not extend into the bottom flange are subject to 41 an engineering assessment .
Such members may not be serviceable and may be rejected .
42 Members with one or more vertical cracks that extend into the bottom flange and are spaced 43 at a distance greater than the member depth are subject to an engineering assessment to 44 determine their acceptability .
If this engineering assessment is required , submit , at no 45 additional cost to the Department , a proposal for repairing the member and a structural 46 evaluation of the member prepared by an engineer licensed by the State of North Carolina .
47 Section 1078 10-144 In the structural evaluation , consider the stresses under full service loads had the member not 1 cracked and the effects of localized loss of prestress at the crack as determined by methods 2 acceptable to the Department .
3 All members , except those defined as unacceptable , which exhibit vertical cracks before 4 detensioning , shall receive a 7 day water cure as directed by the Engineer .
The water cure 5 shall begin within 4 hours after detensioning the prestressing strands and shall be at least 6 3 feet beyond the region exhibiting vertical cracks .
7 The Department has the final determination regarding acceptability of any members in 8 question .
9 1078-13 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE GIRDER WEB SPLITTING 10 After detensioning of certain girders with draped strands , cracks occasionally occur in the 11 webs at the ends of the girders .
12 Repair all cracks located in the web of girders appearing after detensioning that are 13 0.010 inches ( 0.25 mm ) or greater in width by means of epoxy injection in accordance with 14 the Standard Specifications and as approved by the Engineer .
15 Repair any web cracks that are less than 0.010 inches ( 0.25 mm ) and greater than 0.005 inches 16 ( 0.15 mm ) in width by coating them with an approved clear , water based alkylalkoxysilane 17 ( silane ) penetrating sealant having a minimum 40 percent solids .
Use a sealant that meets the 18 requirement of NCHRP 244 and Federal AIM VOC emissions standards and has been 19 approved by the Engineer .
Coat web cracks between 0.005 inches ( 0.15 mm ) and 0.010 inches 20 ( 0.25 mm ) in width with silane within 2 weeks after they appear or before shipment to the site 21 whichever occurs soonest .
22 Cracks located in the web less than or equal to 0.005 ( 0.15 mm ) in width need not be coated .
23 Do not repair or coat any cracks without prior approval of the Engineer .
No separate payment 24 will be made for the treatment of cracks , as payment is included in the contract unit price bid 25 for prestressed concrete girders .
26 Repair of web cracks shall not be a substitute for using an approved debonding pattern for 27 future girders as described below .
28 If such cracks occur , employ a method to remedy this condition on all subsequent girders of 29 the same type and strand pattern .
If debonding of strands is used , satisfy the following 30 criteria : 31 ( A ) Do not debond the two straight strands in the top of the girder .
Debond 1/2 of the straight 32 strands , as nearly as possible , in the bottom flange .
As nearly as possible , debond 1/4 of 33 the straight strands in the bottom of girder 4 feet from each end of the girder and debond 34 1/4 of the straight strands 2 feet from each end of the girder .
35 ( B ) Use a debonding pattern that is symmetrical about the vertical axis of the girder .
36 ( C ) Debond strands so the center of gravity of the strands in the bottom of the girder remain 37 within 1 inch of their original location at the end of the girder .
38 ( D ) Debond strands in accordance with Article 1078-7 .
39 No separate payment is made for debonding strands as payment is included in the contract 40 unit price bid for prestressed concrete girders .
41 Section 1078 10-145 1078-14 HANDLING , TRANSPORTING AND STORING 1 Members damaged while being handled or transported are rejected or require repair in 2 a manner approved by the Engineer .
All members are allowed to be handled immediately 3 after transfer of load from the anchorages to the members is complete .
4 Store all prestressed members on solid , unyielding , storage blocks in a manner to prevent 5 torsion or objectionable bending .
In handling prestressed concrete girders 54 inches or less in 6 height , including cored slabs and box beams , maintain them in an upright position at all times 7 and pick them up within 5 feet of the points of bearing and transport and store supported only 8 within 3 feet of points of bearing .
In handling prestressed concrete girders greater than 54 9 inches in height , maintain them in an upright position at all times and submit for approval the 10 proposed method of lifting , transporting , and storing the girders .
When requested , provide 11 calculations to confirm girders are not overstressed by such operations .
12 Prestressed concrete panels are weak in the direction perpendicular to the prestressing strands , 13 therefore , they are subject to breakage during handling , storing or transporting .
Provide 14 adequate blocking during all of these construction phases .
15 In handling , transporting , and storing prestressed members , use the number and location of 16 supports in accordance with the plan requirements for the sizes , lengths and types of members 17 involved , or as approved .
18 When handling the prestressed concrete members , a temporary stress of cif 5 is permitted , 19 where cif is the strength of concrete at release , in pounds per square inch .
20 Do not transport members away from the casting yard until the concrete reaches the minimum 21 required 28 day compressive strength and a period of at least 5 days elapses since casting , 22 unless otherwise permitted .
23 Do not transfer any member from the plant to the job site before approval of that member by 24 the plant inspector .
This approval is stamped on the member by the plant inspector .
25 1078-15 FINAL FINISH 26 Finish prestressed concrete members that are intended for composite action with subsequently 27 placed concrete or asphalt with a roughened surface for bonding .

Fill all voids in piles greater than 1/2 inch in diameter or depth as above .
Provide 43 a resulting surface finish essentially the same color and surface finish as the surrounding 44 concrete .
Repair voids greater than 1/4 inch in diameter or depth in other faces of these and 45 other members except piles in a like manner .
Where an excessive number of smaller voids 46 exist in any member , the Engineer requires a similar repair .
47 Section 1078 10-146 Repair honeycomb , excessively large fins , and other projections as directed .
Submit , at no 1 additional cost to the Department , a proposal for repairing members with honeycomb , cracks 2 or spalls .
Do not repair members containing honeycomb , cracks , or spalls until a repair 3 procedure is approved and the member is inspected by the Engineer .
Any appreciable 4 impairment of structural adequacy that can not be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer is 5 cause for rejection .
6 Clean and fill holes caused by strand hold downs upon removal from the casting bed .
Use 7 patches of materials approved by the Engineer that develop strength at least equal to the 8 minimum 28 day strength requirement for the concrete before approval of the member .
9 Ensure that members are clean and surfaces have a uniform appearance .
10 Give the top surface of prestressed concrete panels a raked finish or other approved finish to 11 provide an adequate bond with the cast-in-place concrete .
As soon as the condition of the 12 concrete permits , rake the top surface of the concrete making depressions of approximately 13 1/4 inch .
Take care when raking not to catch and pull the coarse aggregate .

29 SECTION 1081 30 EPOXY AND ADHESIVES 31 1081-1 EPOXY RESIN SYSTEMS 32 ( A ) Classification 33 The types of epoxies and their uses are as shown below : 34 Type 1 - A low-modulus , non-sag gel adhesive used to bond or repair damp , vertical or 35 overhead surfaces .
Typical applications include walls , concrete foundations , concrete 36 pipe , conduit and ceilings .
37 Type 2 - A low-modulus , general-purpose adhesive used in epoxy mortar repairs .
It may 38 be used to patch spalled , cracked or broken concrete where vibration , shock or expansion 39 and contraction are expected .
Feather-edged patching is not recommended with this 40 material ; instead , the adjacent concrete perimeter should be sawed at least 1/4 inch to 41 1/2 inch deep and any remaining concrete chipped away to provide a vertical interface 42 between the epoxy mortar and concrete .
43 Type 3 - A high-modulus general-purpose adhesive used to bond plastic concrete or 44 hardened concrete to hardened concrete or other structural materials .
It may be used to 45 produce a high-strength epoxy mortar grout bed for equipment or to patch interior spalls , 46 cracks or broken concrete .
It is not recommended for exterior patching because its rate of 47 thermal expansion and contraction differs too greatly from concrete .
It may be used for 48 anchoring bolts where a flowable adhesive is required .
49 Section 1081 10-164 Type 3A - A gel-like version of Type 3 , used specifically for embedding dowel bars , 1 threaded rods , rebars and other fixtures in hardened concrete .
2 Type 4A - A gray protective coating for concrete , wood , steel and other structural 3 materials .
It is typically used as a topcoat in waterproofing concrete exposed to splash 4 zones and tidal water .
5 Type 4B - A red primer coating used with Type 4A .
6 Type 5 - A high modulus , low viscosity adhesive suitable for pressure injection into 7 cracks in concrete .
For some non-structural crack repairs , Type 5 epoxy may be poured 8 on the surface to penetrate cracks by gravity .
This may be beneficial before 9 waterproofing and skid proofing .
10 ( B ) Requirements 11 Epoxies shall conform to the requirements shown in Table 1081-1 using the test methods 12 described in Article 1081-3 .
13 For epoxy resin systems used for embedding dowel bars , threaded rods , rebar , anchor 14 bolts and other fixtures in hardened concrete , the manufacturer shall submit test results 15 showing that the bonding system will obtain 125 % of the specified required yield 16 strength of the fixture .
Furnish certification that , for the particular bolt grade , diameter 17 and embedment depth required , the anchor system will not fail by adhesive failure and 18 that there is no movement of the anchor bolt .
For certification and anchorage , use 19 3,000 psi as a minimum Portland cement concrete compressive strength used in this test .
20 Use adhesives that meet Section 1081 .
21 List the properties of the adhesive on the container and include density , minimum and 22 maximum temperature application , setting time , shelf life , pot life , shear strength and 23 compressive strength .
24 ( C ) Properties of Epoxy Resin Systems 25 ( 1 ) All integral fillers , pigments and thixotropic agents shall be fine enough to not 26 separate , settle or cause skinning during storage of the epoxy components .
Do not 27 use abrasive fillers such as alumina and silica flour .
Do not use solvents .
When 28 mineral fillers are to be added during mixing , they shall be inert , readily dispersible 29 and except for sand , have fineness such that 99 % of the material will pass 30 a No .
325 sieve .
31 ( 2 ) The coefficient of expansion of cured epoxy is 6 times greater than that of concrete .
32 Therefore , to reduce spalling and peeling during temperature changes , avoid thick 33 layers of pure epoxy .
A 4:1 by weight sand-epoxy mortar has approximately the 34 same coefficient of expansion as concrete .
35 ( 3 ) The shelf life of parts A and B shall be at least one year from the date of 36 manufacture .
37 ( 4 ) Types 1 through 5 epoxy resin systems are moisture insensitive and can be applied 38 on clean , dry or damp surfaces free of standing water .

14 Furnish the two components in separate non-reactive containers .
Provide containers of 15 such size that the proportions of the final mix can be obtained by combining a single 16 container of one component with one or more whole containers of the other component .
17 ( H ) Notes on Use of Epoxies 18 ( 1 ) Safety 19 Epoxies can irritate the eyes , skin and respiratory tract .
Therefore , wear chemical 20 splash goggles , chemically-resistant gloves and protective clothing and boots when 21 handling epoxies .
Respiratory protection is usually not needed if epoxies are mixed 22 and applied in well-ventilated areas , but avoid prolonged breathing of vapors .
23 Follow all MSDS instructions for proper use of these materials .
24 ( 2 ) Mixing 25 Stir parts A and B individually until each component is homogeneous .
Use a separate 26 stirrer for each component .
27 Combine parts A and B , either by weight or volume , as specified in the 28 manufacturer ’ s instructions .
Stir the mixture vigorously , periodically scraping the 29 sides and bottom of the container .
Small quantities of epoxy usually require 2 to 30 3 minutes to mix homogeneously ; 5-gallon quantities can take up to 10 minutes of 31 mixing .
32 Temperature affects the viscosity and pot life of epoxies .
Most laboratory tests are 33 conducted at 77°F .
Higher temperatures render epoxies thinner and faster setting ; 34 lower temperatures induce higher viscosities and longer pot lives .
35 Add sand or other fillers to liquid epoxies only after parts A and B have been 36 thoroughly mixed .
Stir in the sand or filler until all particles are completely coated .
37 ( 3 ) Storage and Substrate Temperature 38 Store epoxies at temperatures between 50°F and 90°F .
Epoxy components exposed 39 to the extremes of this range or outside this range should be conditioned to 77°F 40 before mixing and blending .
If heat is necessary , always use indirect methods such 41 as hot water , a heated room or a microwave oven to condition components .
42 When applying epoxy to a cold substrate , preheat the components approximately 1°F 43 above 77°F for every 2°F of substrate temperature below 77°F .
44 Seal previously opened containers to be airtight .
Unsealed containers can absorb 45 moisture from the atmosphere , which can alter the chemical reaction of the mixture .

Add 50 ml of 1,1,1-trichloroethane to the adhesive , which should be 2 broken up in small pieces to speed up the dissolution solids .
Place the sample flask 3 in a balanced centrifuge and spin using a minimum relative centrifugal force of 4 150 in accordance with ASTM D1796 for 10 minutes .
Remove the sample flask and 5 decant the solid , taking care not to lose any solids .
Repeat the application of solvent 6 and centrifuging until the solvent becomes clear and the filler is visually free of 7 asphalt .
Dry the filler at 160°F ± 5°F to remove solvent and weigh the resulting 8 filler .
Filtration of the decanted solvent may be performed to verify there is no loss 9 of filler .
Percent filler content is calculated as follows : 10 Filter Content , % by Weight = Filler Weight , grams x 100 Original Adhesive Weight , grams Determine Filler Fineness according to ASTM C430 using number 325 , 200 and 11 100 sieves .
This method is to be modified by using a water soluble non-ionic 12 wetting agent , such as Triton X-100 , to aid the wetting action .
Concentration of the 13 surfactant solution shall be approximately 1 % by weight .
Thoroughly wet the one- 14 gram dry sample in the surfactant solution and allowed to soak for 30 minutes .
