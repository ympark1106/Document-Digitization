( b ) If there are unauthorized additions , conditional or alternate bids , or irregularities of any kind which may tend to make the proposal incomplete , indefinite , or ambiguous as to its meaning .
( c ) If the bidder adds any provisions reserving the right to accept or reject an award , or to enter into a contract pursuant to an award .

Following the opening of bids , the Department will examine the unit bid prices of all bidders for reasonable conformance with the Engineer ’ s Estimate .
A bid tabulation including calculated percentage variances from the Engineer ’ s Estimate for each bid item will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Bid Review and Analysis Team ( BRAT ) for further review .
In determining whether a unit bid price is unbalanced and subject to rejection , the BRAT will consider , but not be limited to , the following criteria : ( a ) Mathematically unbalanced bids which are not found to be materially unbalanced may be awarded .
( b ) If the quantities as bid are incorrect and the contract cost will be increased when quantities are corrected , the bid may be rejected .
( c ) On items where the quantities may vary , if the anticipated variation in quantity would result in the lower bidder not remaining as the low bidder , the bid may be rejected .
( d ) If the mathematical unbalancing has a potential detrimental effect upon the competitive process or can cause contract administration problems after the award , the bid may be rejected .
( e ) Over pricing items for work done early in the contract ( front end loading ) could be considered as a materially unbalanced bid , and the bid may be rejected .
102 BIDDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS 10 Other factors the BRAT will consider in the bid analysis are : Number of bids .

The bidder will have the opportunity to meet in person with the reconsideration official to discuss the issue of whether it met the goal or made adequate good faith efforts to do so .
A written decision on reconsideration will be sent to the bidder explaining the basis for finding that they did or did not meet the goal or make adequate good faith efforts to do so .
The result of the reconsideration process is not administratively appealable to the Department .
Failure by the Contractor to fulfill the DBE/SBE contract requirements and to demonstrate good faith efforts constitutes a breach of this contract .
In such instance , the Department may : ( a ) Withhold progress payments or portion thereof ; ( b ) Deduct as damages an amount equal to the unmet portion of the DBE/SBE commitment not achieved ; ( c ) Remove the Contractor from the prequalified bidders list for repeated violations ; ( d ) Suspend and debar for violations , falsifications , or misrepresentations ; ( e ) Terminate the contract ; or ( f ) Refer the matter for criminal prosecution .
17 SECTION 104 SCOPE OF WORK 104.01 Intent of the Contract .
The intent of the contract is to provide for the construction and completion in every detail of the work described .
Furnish all labor , materials , equipment , tools , transportation , and supplies required to complete the work according to the plans , specifications , and terms of the contract .
104.02 Changes in Character of Work and Differing Site Conditions .
( a ) Changes .
The Engineer reserves the right to make , in writing , at any time during the work , such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project .
Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the surety , and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as altered .
The right is reserved to increase or decrease any or all of the items in the estimate of approximate quantities as shown in the proposal .
Should any items contained in the proposal be found unnecessary for the proper completion of the work , written order may be given to eliminate such items from the contract , and such action shall in no way invalidate the contract .
When a Contractor is notified of the elimination of items , actual work done and all costs incurred will be reimbursed , including mobilization of materials before said notification .
The length of the project may be increased or decreased by adding or omitting sections or by relocation .
Under no circumstances shall alterations of plans or of the nature of the work involve work beyond the termini of the proposed construction except as may be necessary to satisfactorily complete the project .
Whenever the termini of the project are changed , a supplemental agreement acceptable to both parties to the contract shall be executed in advance of performing the affected work .
( b ) Significant Changes in the Character of Work .
If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the contract , whether or not changed by any such different quantities or alterations , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made to the contract .
The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon before the performance of the work .
If a basis can not be agreed upon , then an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable .
Any such price adjustment will be determined by documented proof of an increase or decrease in actual costs .
Documentation for an increase in costs shall include a breakdown showing the basis of the unit bid price .
Failure to give notification in writing of a change in character of work and subsequent performance of said work will be considered as a waiver thereof and payment will be made at the contract unit price for the actual quantity of the work performed .
If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the contract , the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the contract .
The term “ significant change ” shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances : 1 .
When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction , or 2 .
When an item of work is increased in excess of 125 % of the original contract quantity and the item of work , after the increase , exceeds a value of $ 50,000 or 5 % of the original contract cost , whichever is the lesser amount , either party to the contract may seek a unit price adjustment .
Any allowance due to the increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 % of the original contract item quantity .
3 .
If a major item of work , decreases below 75 % of the original contract quantity , either party to the contract may seek a unit price adjustment .
However , the total payment shall not exceed that which would be made for 75 % of the original proposal quantity at the contract unit price .
Price adjustments for decreases of other than Major Contract Items will not be allowed .
( c ) Differing Site Conditions .
During the progress of the work , if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature , differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the contract , are encountered at the site , the party discovering such conditions shall immediately notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before the conditions are disturbed and before the affected work is performed .
104 SCOPE OF WORK 18 Upon written notification , conditions will be investigated , and if determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the contract , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly .
Notification of the determination of whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted will be given .
No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the required written notice is provided .
104.03 Extra Work .
Perform unforeseen work , for which there is no price included in the contract , whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable in order to complete fully the work as contemplated .

The DRT will assist in , and facilitate , the timely and equitable resolution of disputes between the Engineer and the Contractor in an effort to avoid construction delay and litigation .
The intent is that the DRT be utilized only after the partnering dispute resolution process has been exhausted .
It is intended that the DRT encourage the Engineer and Contractor to resolve potential disputes without resorting to the hearing of disputes by the DRT .
It is not intended for the Engineer or the Contractor to default on their normal responsibility to amicably and fairly settle their differences by indiscriminately assigning them to the DRT .
Either the Engineer or the Contractor may request a dispute be heard by the DRT .
Such a request may be made as soon as it appears that the partnering dispute resolution process is not succeeding .
The DRT shall fairly and impartially consider disputes referred to it , and shall provide written recommendations to the Engineer and the Contractor , to assist in the resolution of these disputes .
Although the recommendations of the DRT should carry great weight for both the Engineer and the Contractor , they are not binding on either Party .
If the DRT recommendation does not resolve the dispute , the written recommendation , including any minority report , will be admissible as evidence , to the extent permitted by law , in any subsequent proceeding or forum to establish : ( a ) that a DRT considered the Dispute ; ( b ) the qualifications of the DRT members ; and ( c ) the DRT recommendation that resulted from the process .
At all times during the course of the dispute resolution , the Contractor shall continue with the work as directed , in a diligent manner and without delay , or shall conform to the Engineer ’ s decision or order , and shall be governed by all applicable provisions of the contract .
Records of the work shall be kept in sufficient detail to enable payment in accordance with applicable provisions in the contract .

The subcontractor or assignee shall not have any claim against the Department by reason of the approval of the subcontract or assignment .
Submit requests for permission to sublet , assign , or otherwise dispose of any portion of the contract in writing and accompany with a letter showing that the organization which will perform the work is particularly experienced for such work .
Consent to sublet , assign , or otherwise dispose of any portion of the contract shall not be construed to relieve the Contractor of his liability under the contract and bonds .
Without exception and before the performance of any work by a subcontractor , submit a request to sublet and 2 certified copies of a fully executed subcontract between the Contractor and the subcontractor .
This also applies to lower tier subcontracts .
In preparing such copies , the prices agreed upon for the work may be omitted , except as follows : ( a ) The type , amount , and price for partial items of work must be clearly indicated .
( b ) Subcontracts with DBE/SBE firms must clearly show the type , amount , and agreed price for the work .

The Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part , for such period as he may deem necessary , due to unsuitable weather or to such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the suitable prosecution of the work , or for such time as he may deem necessary due to the failure on the part of the Contractor to carry out orders given , or to perform any provision of the contract .
Immediately comply with the written order to suspend the work wholly or in part .
Resume the suspended work when conditions are favorable and methods are corrected , as ordered or approved in writing .
Maintain the roadway during suspension of the work when such suspensions are due to the Contractor ’ s negligence .
During any other suspension , make passable and open to traffic such portions of the project and temporary roadways or portions thereof as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Engineer for the temporary accommodation of traffic during the anticipated period of suspension .
Thereafter , and until an issuance of an order for the resumption of construction operations , the maintenance of the temporary route or line of travel agreed upon will be by and at the expense of the Department .
Such maintenance and responsibility will include and be restricted to the traveled roadway for the convenience of public travel ; opening plugged pipes and roadway ditches and drains ; or correcting any other hazard which may be detrimental to adjacent property owners or the traveling public .
When work is resumed , replace , renew , and repair any work or materials lost or damaged because of such temporary use of the project regardless of the cause of such damage or loss , except as provided in Subsection 107.15 .
The Department is in no way responsible to maintain the roadway and appurtenances in any certain condition or state of repair .
Complete the project in every respect as though its prosecution had been continuous and without interference .
If a suspension of work is ordered by reason of the failure to carry out orders or to perform any provision of the contract , or by reason of weather conditions being unsuitable for performing any item or items of work , which work , could have been performed before the occurrence of such unsuitable weather conditions had the work been PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 108 61 diligently prosecuted when weather conditions were suitable , perform all the work necessary to provide a safe , smooth and unobstructed passageway through construction for use by public traffic during the period of such suspension as provided in Subsection 107.07 , and as specified in the Special Provisions for the work .
For failure to perform the work above specified , the Department will perform such work and the cost thereof will be deducted from money due or to become due .
If a suspension of work is ordered due to unsuitable weather conditions , and the work was prosecuted with energy and diligence before the time that operations were suspended , the cost of providing a smooth and unobstructed passageway through the work will be paid for as extra work as provided in Subsection 104.03 , or at the option of the Engineer , such work will be performed by the Department at no cost to the Contractor .
If ordered to suspend all of the work or a portion of the work which is the current controlling operation or operations , due to unsuitable weather or to such other conditions as are considered unfavorable to the suitable prosecution of the work , the days on which the suspension is in effect shall not be considered working days as defined in Subsection 101.03 , for “ Working Day. ” If a portion of work at the time of such suspension is not a current controlling operation or operations , but subsequently does become the current controlling operation or operations , the determination of working days will be made on the basis of the then current controlling operation or operations .
If a suspension of work is ordered , due to the failure to carry out orders given or to perform any provision of the contract , the days on which the suspension order is in effect shall be considered working days if such days are working days within the meaning of the definition set forth in Subsection 101.03 , for “ Working Day. ” A suspension of work under any of the conditions set forth in this Section , shall not relieve the responsibilities as set forth in Section 107 .
Requests for additional compensation due to the ordered suspension of work shall be based on the following : ( a ) If the performance of work is suspended or delayed by written order for an unreasonable period of time ( not originally anticipated , customary , or inherent to the construction industry ) and believing that additional compensation and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay , submit in writing a request for adjustment within 7 days of receipt of the notice to resume work .
The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment .
( b ) Upon receipt , the request will be evaluated .
If agreed that the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor , its suppliers , or subcontractors at any approved tier , and not caused by weather , an adjustment ( excluding profit ) and modification to the contract will be made in writing accordingly .
Notification of the determination of whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted will be made .
( c ) No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the request for adjustment was submitted within the time prescribed .
( d ) No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause , or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract .
108.07 Preconstruction Conference .
After the contract has been awarded and before commencing work , the Engineer may designate a time and place satisfactory to the Contractor for a preconstruction conference .
At such time the detailed requirements will be outlined to be followed in performance of the contract .
108.08 Determination and Extension of Contract Time .
The contract time for completion will be fixed by the Department , and will be stated in the Special Provisions , either as a calendar date or based on a number of working days .
See Subsection 101.03 , for “ Working Day. ” Perform the work in an acceptable manner within the time stated in the contract except that the contract time for completion may be adjusted as follows : ( a ) Based on the merits of specific circumstances encountered during the term of the contract , the Engineer may adjust the contract time allowed to complete the work .
Any such adjustment of time shall be in writing .
108 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 62 ( b ) In case of ordered suspension of major items of work and through no fault of the Contractor , the time for completion shall be extended an amount equal to the elapsed time between effective dates of order to suspend and order to resume .
( c ) When delays occur due to unforeseen causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor , including , but not restricted to acts of God , acts of the public enemy , acts of government agency , fires , floods , epidemics , strikes and freight embargoes , the time for completion shall be extended an amount determined to be equivalent to the delays ; provided , however , written request for such extension of time is made within 10 days after the beginning of such delay .
No allowance shall be made for delay or suspension of the work due to fault of the Contractor .
Certain critical materials such as , steel , copper , aluminum and bituminous products may be difficult to obtain due to a nationally recognized shortage or defense needs .
Make every reasonable effort necessary to order and procure all such critical materials sufficiently in advance so as not to delay the completion of the project .
Should a delay occur in obtaining critical materials that were properly ordered , the time for completion of the contract may be extended an amount determined to be equivalent to the delay in project progress due to said delay in obtaining critical materials provided : ( a ) The delay in furnishing critical materials was due to defense needs or nationally recognized shortage .
( b ) That satisfactory evidence is furnished that adequate steps were taken for a guaranteed delivery date from his supplier .
( c ) That paragraph “ ( a ) ” above is properly certified to by not less than three suppliers of the material .
If three suppliers are not available , so certify and supply certification from such suppliers as there are .
( d ) That the Department does not find a source when notified of the shortage by the Contractor .
( e ) That such material is obtained from the first source available after such certification .
The contract time shall begin as set forth in Subsection 108.02 .
When the final acceptance has been duly made as prescribed in Subsection 105.16 , the daily time charge shall cease .
Working days will not be charged for seeding deposit areas , haul roads and that work set forth in Subsection 104.05 , provided that all other work has been completed .
108.09 Failure to Complete the Work on Time .
Time is an essential element of the contract and it is important that the work be pressed vigorously to completion .
The cost to the Department of the administration of the contract , including engineering , inspection , and supervision will be increased as the time occupied in the work is lengthened .
The public is subject to detriment and inconvenience when full use can not be made of an incomplete project .
For failure to complete the work within the time specified in the contract or within such extra time as may have been allowed by increases in the contract or by formally approved extensions granted by the Department , there will be deducted from any money or amounts due or that may become due , the sum set forth in the Special Provisions for each and every working day that the work remains uncompleted .
This sum shall be considered and treated not as a penalty but as liquidated damages due the State by reason of inconvenience to the public , added cost of engineering and supervision and other items which have caused an expenditure of public funds resulting from his failure to complete the work within the time specified in the contract .
Permission to continue and finish the work or any part of it after the time fixed for its completion , or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended , will in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights under the contract .
Working days normally will not be charged for seeding deposit areas , haul roads , and that work set forth in Subsection 104.05 provided that all other work has been completed .
However based upon presumptive completion of all pay items , as determined by the Engineer , 30 days or 10 % of the contract working days , whichever is greater , will be allowed to perform final clean up .
If all work required in Subsection 104.05 is not finished within the above time charging of working days will be resumed until the final clean up has been completed .

109.04 Asphalt Escalation .
The use of the price adjustment provisions as developed and implemented herein are intended to minimize the cost effects of price uncertainty to the Contractor and the Department for “ Asphalt Cement ” used in the construction of the contract .
The price adjustment provisions are not intended to serve as a guarantee for full compensation for “ Asphalt Cement ” price fluctuations but are intended to be a sharing , by the Department , in a portion of the Contractor ’ s risk which could result from potentially volatile price fluctuations that might occur throughout the duration of the contract .
The price adjustment provisions do not serve to relieve the Contractor of risks associated with fluctuation in prices beyond the amount adjusted by the provisions .
This adjustment will be full compensation for any and all price fluctuations , including but not limited to taxes , transportation , and delays .
The price adjustment provisions are only applicable to “ Asphalt Cement ; ” they are not applicable to cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt .
The term “ Asphalt Cement ” as used herein is applicable to PG grades as specified in Subsection 703.03.02 .
The progress payment will be adjusted upward or downward , as calculated by the `` Total Bi-Weekly Adjustment . ''
These adjustments will be determined by the Department and will be based on selling prices for asphalt cement in the Poten & Partners Asphalt Weekly Monitor report .
The sources used by the Department to determine the asphalt cement price at any given time will be the selling prices for Utah/Idaho/Nevada for non-modified paving grades and the California paving grades .
The average of the high and low selling price for each of the following areas will be used : Utah - Salt Lake City area ; Idaho - Boise area , Eastern markets , Northern markets [ includes E.WA ] ; Nevada - Las Vegas area , Reno area ; California - San Francisco area , Los Angeles area , Bakersfield area .
Each of these nine average area prices is then used to calculate the weekly average price ; the weekly average price is used to calculate the `` Basic Materials Index . ''
The adjustment will be made by comparing a '' Basic Materials Index '' to a `` Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index . ''
The method for making this comparison is described in the following paragraphs : ( a ) A “ Basic Materials Index ” will be determined by the Department on a weekly basis .
The “ Basic Materials Index ” in effect for the week a contract bid opening occurs will be the “ Basic Materials Index ” for that contract .
The “ Basic Materials Index ” will be arrived at by averaging the Monday posting of the current week and the Monday posting of the three previous weeks .
The “ Basic Material Index ” price for “ Asphalt Cement ” will be available on an informational basis to interested parties but said prices will not be available prior to the first regular business day of the week of the bid opening .
The price may be obtained by contacting the Department ’ s Construction Division .
( b ) During the time that the `` Asphalt Cement '' is used on this contract , the Department will maintain selling prices in $ /English ton ( short ton ) for asphalt cement to be used to obtain a `` Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index . ''
The “ Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index ” will be arrived at by averaging the Monday posting of the current week and the Monday posting of the three previous weeks and will be compared with the “ Basic Materials Index ” price to determine a “ Bi-Weekly Material Price Adjustment. ” ( c ) The adjustment for said `` Asphalt Cement '' will be subject to increase or decrease in accordance with the following provision for `` Asphalt Cement '' price fluctuations exceeding 10 % .
The adjustment will be determined in accordance with the following formula for “ Asphalt Cement ” used during the progress payment : Total Bi-Weekly Adjustment = AQ 109 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT 72 For an increase in the Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index exceeding 10 % of the Basic Materials Index : A = [ Bp — Bi ( 1.10 ) ] F For a decrease in the Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index exceeding 10 % of the Basic Materials Index : A = [ Bi ( 0.90 ) — Bp ] F Where : A = “ Bi-Weekly Material Price Adjustment ” in dollars per metric ton ( ton ) of “ Asphalt Cement ” rounded to the nearest dollar .
Bi = “ Basic Materials Index ” for the week in which the bid opening for the contract occurred ( US $ /short ton ) .
This is calculated as noted in paragraph ( a ) above .
Bp = “ The Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index ” ( US $ /short ton ) calculated for the progress payment period .
This is calculated as noted in paragraph ( b ) above .
F = 1.102311 = Factor to convert $ /short ton to $ /metric ton ( 1.00 to remain $ /short tons ) .
Q = Quantity in metric tons ( tons ) of “ Asphalt Cement ” calculated from the amount of plantmix paid for during the progress payment period .
The quantity , in metric tons ( tons ) , of “ Asphalt Cement ” will be calculated using the approved mix design and the following formula : Q = Wet tons used x % Asphalt / 100 [ 1 + ( % Asphalt + % Mineral Filler ) / 100 ] ( d ) The adjustment in compensation will also be subject to the following : 1 .
The compensation adjustments provided herein , will be shown separately on the progress payment .
The Contractor shall be liable to the State for decreased compensation adjustments and the Department may deduct the amount thereof from any monies due or that may become due the Contractor .
2 .
The Department reserves the right to cancel the contract whenever the “ Bi-Weekly Materials Adjustment Index ” exceeds the “ Basic Materials Index ” by 75 % .
The contract may be canceled in part or in whole by the Department .
If the Department elects to cancel the contract , in part or in whole , price adjustments will not be allowed for other than major bid items .
Adjustments to major bid items will be in accordance with Subsection 104.02 .
109.05 Fuel Escalation .
The Fuel Escalation Clause , as described herein , may be enacted when requested by the Contractor or deemed necessary by the Department .
Enactment of the Fuel Escalation Clause will only be considered when the increase or decrease of the “ Contract Price ” for fuel as defined herein exceeds 25 % .
The use of the price adjustment provisions developed for the Fuel Escalation Clause are intended to minimize the cost effects of price uncertainty to the Contractor and the Department , for fuel used in the construction of this contract .
The price adjustment provisions are not intended to compensate the Contractor for what would be considered normal day-to-day fluctuations or seasonal changes .
The price adjustment provisions are not intended to serve as a guarantee for full compensation for fuel price fluctuations but are intended to provide for a sharing , by the Department , in a portion of the Contractor ’ s risk which could result from unusual price fluctuations .
The price adjustment provisions do not serve to relieve the Contractor of risks associated with fluctuation in prices beyond the amount adjusted by the provisions .
If the Fuel Escalation Clause is activated , the clause will apply from the period of time the unusual price for fuel began , until the end of the contract .
Fuel Escalation Clause Contract fuel costs will be adjusted upward or downward on a bi-weekly basis .
To accomplish this adjustment the Department will determine , for each contract , a “ Fuel Factor Percentage ” that represents an estimated percent of fuel cost by type of construction .
The “ Fuel Factor Percentage ” will be applied to each bi-weekly progress payment balance due ( excluding payments for stockpiled materials ) to determine a “ Bi-weekly Fuel Cost. ” The bi-weekly fuel adjustment will be calculated by comparing a “ Contract Price ” to an “ Adjustment Price ” to determine a percent of increase or decrease .
The adjustment will be determined by the Department using the average diesel ( No .
2 fuel oil ) price postings for Reno and Las Vegas as provided by Oil Price Information Services .
The method for calculating the “ Bi-weekly Fuel Adjustment ” will be as described in the following paragraphs : MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT 109 73 ( a ) Fuel Factor Percentage ( Ffp ) .
The “ Fuel Factor Percentage ” ( Ffp ) will be an estimated fuel factor as a percentage of cost by type of construction as determined by the Department .
The “ Fuel Factor Percentage ” will be specified in the Special Provisions .
( b ) Bi-Weekly Fuel Cost ( Bfc ) .
The “ Bi-Weekly Fuel Cost ” ( Bfc ) will be the contract bi-weekly progress payment balance due ( excluding payments for stockpiled materials ) multiplied by the “ Fuel Factor Percentage. ” ( c ) Base Price ( Bp ) .
The “ Base Price ” ( Bp ) for fuel will be determined weekly using the prices posted on Monday of each week .
( d ) Contract Price ( Cp ) .
The “ Contract Price ” ( Cp ) for fuel will be established for the week during which the bid opening is held .
The “ Contract Price ” will be determined using the “ Base Price ” of fuel for the week of the bid opening averaged with the “ Base Price ” of fuel recorded for the previous three weeks .
( e ) Adjustment Price ( Ap ) .
The “ Adjustment Price ” ( Ap ) will be the average of the “ Base Prices ” recorded during the bi-weekly progress payment period .
( f ) Compensation Formula .
The compensation payable as part of each bi-weekly progress payment will be subject to increase or decrease in accordance with the following provisions for fuel price fluctuations exceeding 10 % .
The bi-weekly fuel adjustment will be determined in accordance with the following formula : For an increase in fuel adjustment prices that exceed 10 % of the “ Contract Price ” ( Cp ) : A = [ ( Ap/Cp ) - 1.10 ] Bfc For a decrease in fuel adjustment prices that exceed 10 % of the `` Contract Price '' ( Cp ) : A = [ 0.90 - ( Ap/Cp ) ] Bfc Where : A = Bi-weekly fuel adjustment in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar .
Ap = '' Adjustment Price '' Cp = '' Contract Price '' Bfc = `` Bi-Weekly Fuel Cost '' ( g ) Compensation Adjustment .
The adjustment in compensation for fuel shall also be subject to the following : 1 .
Payment of compensation provided herein will be made as part of the progress payment .
The Contractor shall be liable to the state for decreased compensation adjustments and the Department may deduct the amount thereof from any monies due or that may become due the Contractor .
2 .
The Department reserves the right to cancel the contract whenever the `` Adjusted Price '' exceeds the '' Contract Price '' by 75 % .
The contract may be canceled in part or in whole by the Department .
If the Department elects to cancel the contract , in part or in whole , price adjustments shall not be allowed for other than major bid items .
Adjustments to major bid items shall be in accordance with Subsection 104.02 .
109.06 Partial Payment .
Progress payments will be made once each month as the work satisfactorily progresses .
The progress payments will be based upon material in place , or on the job site and invoiced , and labor expended thereon .
The total amount of the partial payment ascertained as allowable for payment will be paid each month until such time as a total of 85 % of the contract price has been paid .
The contract price will be adjusted upward or downward according to approved changes throughout the life of the contract .
Once 85 % of the adjusted contract price has been paid , the Department may withhold retention in the amount of 5 % of said adjusted contract price or $ 50,000 , whichever is less , until the entire contract is completed satisfactorily and accepted by the Director .
If the work in progress is being performed on a satisfactory basis , the Director may reduce the percentage retained if he finds that sufficient reasons exist for additional payment and has obtained written approval from every surety furnishing bonds for the work .
Any remaining money must be retained until the entire contract is completed satisfactorily and accepted by the Director .

Within each primary unit of pavement , there may be an area or areas which have been determined to be a secondary unit or units of pavement , as provided in Subsection 409.04.02 ( b ) .
In such case , the primary unit area will be reduced by the secondary unit area included therein .
After requirements of Subsection 409.03.14 have been met , thickness measurements will be made in each primary unit of pavement at the rate of not less than one measurement for each 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) , or fraction thereof , of pavement placed in each traffic lane , auxiliary lane or shoulder .

or less .
Panels are the areas bounded by longitudinal and transverse joints and pavement edges .
After eliminating the secondary unit area , or areas , and the thickness measurements therein from consideration , the average thickness deficiency , if any , of the remainder of primary unit areas will be determined as provided in Subsection 409.04.02 ( a ) .
Secondary thickness measurements made outside of a secondary unit area may be used to determine average thickness deficiency , if any , in the remaining primary unit area in which they are taken .
Each panel in which secondary thickness measurements are made will be deemed to be of the thickness shown by such measurement .
After determining the limits of the secondary unit area , determination will be made of which panels , within such area , if any , will be required to be removed and replaced according to procedure 1 , below , and the panels , if any , which will remain in place according to procedure 2 , below .

Support such tubes so as to permit free movement of the discharge end over the entire top surface of the work and to permit rapid lowering when necessary to retard or stop the flow of concrete .
Fill the tubes by a method that will prevent washing of the concrete .
Completely submerge the discharge end in concrete at all times .
The tubes shall contain sufficient concrete to prevent any water entry .
Provide continuous flow until the work is completed and the resulting concrete seal is monolithic and homogeneous .
Concrete deposited in water shall be Class A or Class AA with 10 % extra cement added .
The exact thickness of the seal will depend upon the hydrostatic head , bond and spacing of piles , size of cofferdam , and other related factors , but provide a seal not less than 600 mm ( 2 ft ) in thickness .
Before dewatering , allow the concrete in the seal to cure for not less than 5 days after placing .
If a seal which is to withstand hydrostatic pressure is placed in water having a temperature below 7 °C ( 45 °F ) , increase the curing time before dewatering .
Do not consider periods of time during which the temperature of the water has been continuously below 3 °C ( 38 °F ) as curing time .
After the concrete seal obtains adequate strength , dewater the cofferdam and clean the top of the concrete of all scum , laitance , and sediment .
Before fresh concrete is deposited , remove local high spots as necessary to provide proper clearance for reinforcing steel .
502.03.11 Construction Joints .
Make construction joints only where located on the plans or shown in the pouring schedule , unless otherwise approved .
Concrete construction joints designated as “ construction joint ” on the plans are mandatory and shall be incorporated into the work unless otherwise approved in writing .
Do not place holes or blockouts in deck slabs unless otherwise shown on the plans or as approved in writing .
Where the placing of concrete is delayed until the placed concrete has taken its initial set and for which no expansion joints are provided , plan for in advance and receive approval for construction joints .
Place concrete continuously from joint to joint .
Make these joints perpendicular to the principal lines of stress and , in general , locate at points of minimum shear .
Make joints only as shown on the plans in cantilevered members .
Avoid horizontal joints at piers and abutments , except where specified , and when used do not locate within 600 mm ( 2 ft ) of the normal water level .
Unless otherwise specified , strike off construction joints but do not trowel .
When making a horizontal construction joint , take care to have the concrete as dry as possible , and draw off any excess water or creamy material before the concrete sets .
On all exposed surfaces , make the line of the proposed joint truly straight by placing a temporary straightedge on the inside of the form and pouring the concrete so that it will set flush with the edge as provided .
Avoid visible joints upon exposed faces , smooth the top surfaces of the concrete adjacent to the forms with a trowel .
Where a “ feather edge ” might be produced at a construction joint , as in the sloped top surface of a wing wall , use a form work insert to produce a blocked out portion in the preceding layer which produces an edge thickness of not less than 150 mm ( 6 in . )
in the succeeding layer .
When the work is unexpectedly interrupted by breakdowns , inclement weather , or other causes , and the concrete as placed would produce an improper construction joint , either rearrange the freshly deposited concrete , or continue by hand mixing , if necessary , until a suitable arrangement is made for a construction joint .
When such a joint occurs at a section on which there is shearing stress , provide adequate mechanical bond across the joint by inserting reinforcing steel , or by some other satisfactory means , which will prevent a plane of weakness .
In resuming work , thoroughly clean the surface of the concrete previously placed of dirt , scum , laitance , or other soft or porous materials by one of the following methods : ( a ) Clean concrete surface of fresh concrete ( not more than 8 hours after placement ) with air and water jets in such a manner that the surface is thoroughly cleaned and the aggregate is not loosened .
502 CONCRETE STRUCTURES 230 ( b ) Clean hardened concrete surface ( more than 8 hours after placement ) by abrasive blast methods in such a manner that the aggregate is not loosened or the edges of the concrete shattered .
Thoroughly wash the surface of the joint with clean water and tighten the forms to close contact with the previously placed work .
Wet the surface of the joint just before placing new concrete .
Prior to deck grooving , seal construction joints in decks and approach slabs including an area extending 150 mm ( 6 in . )
on each side of the joint with crack sealant according to Section 646 .

Do not release falsework for bridge spans until the last concrete has attained a compressive strength of 80 % of the specified strength .
In cold weather , increase all time requirements one day for every day the curing time is increased as prescribed in Subsection 501.03.09 ( b ) .
Do not release falsework for cast-in-place prestressed portions of structures until at least 24 hours after all the prestressing steel has been tensioned and grouted .
Do not remove falsework supporting any span of a continuous or rigid frame bridge until all required prestressing has been completed in that span and in the adjacent portions of each adjoining span for a length equal to at least half the length of the span where falsework is to be released .
Remove falsework for arch bridges uniformly and gradually , beginning at the crown and working toward the springing , to permit the arch to take its load slowly and evenly .
Strike falsework for adjacent arch spans simultaneously .
Do not release falsework supporting overhangs , deck slabs between girders , and girder stems which slope 30° or more off vertical before 7 days after the deck concrete has been placed .
Falsework supporting the sides of the girder stems which slope less than 30° off vertical may be removed before placing deck slab concrete , providing a reshoring system is installed .
The reshoring system consists of lateral supports which are designed to resist all rotational forces acting on the stem , including those caused by the placement of deck slab concrete .
Install such lateral supports immediately after each form panel is removed and before the release of supports for the adjacent form panel .
Do not release falsework for bent caps which will support steel or precast concrete girders before 7 days after the cap concrete has been placed .
Do not erect girders onto bent caps or abutments until all associated falsework has been released and the concrete in the cap or abutment has attained a compressive strength of 80 % of the specified strength .
Do not release falsework for box culverts and other structures with decks lower than the roadway pavement and with span lengths of 4.2 m ( 14 ft ) or less until the last placed concrete has attained a compressive strength of 11 MPa ( 1,600 psi ) , provided that curing of the concrete is not interrupted .
Perform falsework removal for other box culverts in conformance to the requirements for release of bridge falsework .
CONCRETE STRUCTURES 502 231 Remove all falsework materials at least 0.6 m ( 2 ft ) below the surface of the original ground or original stream bed .
When falsework piling is driven within the limits of ditch or channel excavation areas , remove the falsework piling within such areas to at least 0.6 m ( 2 ft ) below the bottom and side slopes of said excavated areas .

Concrete will be measured by the cubic meter ( cubic yard ) .
Fine surface finish will be measured by the square meter ( square yard ) .
The estimated quantities shown on the plans for concrete and fine surface finish , plus or minus authorized quantity changes , will be the quantity used for payment .
The Engineer or the Contractor may , however , request final measurement .
Submit request for final measurement in writing .
When final measurement is made the quantities derived therefrom will be the quantities used for payment .
The estimated quantities shown on the plans for reinforced concrete box culverts will be based upon dimensions required for cast-in-place construction , regardless of said method being optional .
There will be no adjustment of quantities due to the optional use of the precast method .
If Portland cement concrete is placed and is shown by test to be below the specified 28 day compressive strength , the Engineer will determine as to whether the concrete shall be removed and replaced or allowed to remain in place .
This determination will be based on an evaluation of the durability and other qualities of the concrete necessary to the integrity of the structure .
If the concrete is allowed to remain in place , the Department will deduct from money due , or to become due to the Contractor from the Department , a percentage of the unit bid price .
This deduction shall be considered to be liquidated damages and shall be at a rate of 3 % of the contract unit bid price for each 1 % ( rounded to the nearest 1 % ) below 95 % of the 28 day compressive strength to a maximum of 30 % of the unit bid price , as set forth in the following example .
Percent of Specified 28 Day Examples Liquidated Damage Compressive Strength MPa ( psi ) Per Unit Bid Price 100 .................................. 21.0 ( 3,000 ) — 31.0 ( 4,500 ) .................................... 0 95 .................................. 20.0 ( 2,850 ) — 29.5 ( 4,275 ) .................................... 0 94 .................................. 19.7 ( 2,820 ) — 29.2 ( 4,230 ) .................................... 3 93 .................................. 19.5 ( 2,790 ) — 28.9 ( 4,185 ) .................................... 6 92 .................................. 19.3 ( 2,760 ) — 28.5 ( 4,140 ) .................................... 9 91 .................................. 19.1 ( 2,730 ) — 28.2 ( 4,095 ) .................................... 12 90 .................................. 18.9 ( 2,700 ) — 27.9 ( 4,050 ) .................................... 15 89 .................................. 18.7 ( 2,670 ) — 27.6 ( 4,005 ) .................................... 18 88 .................................. 18.5 ( 2,640 ) — 27.3 ( 3,960 ) .................................... 21 87 .................................. 18.3 ( 2,610 ) — 27.0 ( 3,915 ) .................................... 24 86 .................................. 18.1 ( 2,580 ) — 26.7 ( 3,870 ) .................................... 27 85 .................................. 17.9 ( 2,550 ) — 26.4 ( 3,825 ) .................................... 30 The reduced price shall apply to all concrete represented by the strength tests below the specified minimum compressive strength .
If directed , remove and replace concrete represented by the strength tests below the specified minimum compressive strength .
When a compressive strength test falls below the specified 28 day compressive strength , the Department may determine that an alternate strength test is required or the Contractor may request such test .
When the Department determines that an alternate strength test is required , the Contractor will not be liable for the cost of such test .
If the Contractor elects to have an alternate strength test made , the Department will then make such a test ; however , should this test fail to indicate that the 28 day compressive strength requirements have been met , the cost thereof shall be deducted from any money due or to become due the Contractor .
The Contractor shall request an alternate strength test no later than 14 days after receiving the failing compressive strength test result .
The alternate strength test shall consist of obtaining and testing 3 drilled core samples according to ASTM C42 .

Use equipment capable of delivering the premixed material accurately , uniformly , and continuously through the delivery hose .
Control shotcrete application thickness , nozzle technique , air pressure , and rate of shotcrete placement to prevent sagging or sloughing of freshly-applied shotcrete .
Apply the shotcrete from the lower part of the area upwards to prevent accumulation of rebound .
Orient nozzle at a distance and approximately perpendicular to the working face so that rebound will be minimal and compaction will be maximized .
Pay special attention to encapsulating reinforcement .
Do not work rebound back into the construction .
Where shotcrete is used to complete the top ungrouted zone of the nail drill hole near the face , position the nozzle into the mouth of the drillhole to completely fill the void .
A clearly defined pattern of continuous horizontal or vertical ridges or depressions at the reinforcing elements after they are covered with shotcrete will be considered an indication of insufficient reinforcement cover or poor nozzle techniques .
In this case , immediately suspend the application of shotcrete and implement corrective measures before resuming the shotcrete operations .
The shotcreting procedure may be corrected by adjusting the nozzle distance and orientation , by insuring adequate cover over the reinforcement , by adjusting the water content of the shotcrete mix , or by other means .
Adjustment in water content of wet-mix requires requalifying the shotcrete mix .
Taper construction joints uniformly toward the excavation face over a minimum distance equal to the thickness of the shotcrete layer .
Provide a minimum reinforcement overlap at reinforcement splice joints as shown .

This specification covers the quality and size of local mineral materials and commercial mineral fillers used in bituminous courses .
REQUIREMENTS 705.02.01 General .
Provide mineral aggregate from approved deposits .
The use of aggregates from any source may be prohibited when : ( a ) The character of the material is such , in the opinion of the Engineer , as to make improbable the furnishing of aggregates conforming to the requirements of these specifications .
( b ) The character of the material is such , in the opinion of the Engineer , that undue additional costs may be accrued by the State .
The mineral aggregate shall be clean , hard , durable , free from frozen lumps , deleterious matter , and harmful adherent coatings .
Crush and incorporate material between the sizes of the 250 mm ( 10 in . )
in largest dimension and larger than the maximum size specified for a given product , into that specified finished product .
Do not produce other products simultaneously by “ bleeding off ” aggregates .
When Type 2C plantmix aggregate is specified for dense-graded plantmix , produce Type 2C and Open-Graded plantmix aggregates by screening all natural fines passing the 9.5 mm ( 3/8 in . )
sieve from the coarse aggregate .
Such fines may be reintroduced into the mix at a rate not to exceed 10 % by dry mass of the combined aggregates .
Stockpile such fines separately from other sizes of aggregate .
Use natural fines only when all applicable mix design criteria have been met .
705.02.02 Deficiencies .
If the product of any deposit is deficient in the fraction passing the 4.75 mm ( No .
4 ) sieve , additional filler from other approved deposits meeting the physical requirements may be added .
Add the additional material to the drier in a uniform manner from a separate stockpile .
If the added material is a commercial mineral filler , uniformly feed it directly to the plant .
Do not construe this as a waiver of any of the requirements contained herein .
