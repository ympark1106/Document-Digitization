Pipette a 25 ml aliquot and add enough diluted NH4OH to make slightly alkaline to methyl orange or methyl red .
Add 20 ml of cold saturated NH4Cl solution and dilute to form 100 to 125 ml .
Heat to boiling and , while stirring to precipitate the calcium , add 20 ml of cold saturated ( NH 4 ) 2C2O4 .
Let stand 1 min. , and if the precipitate does not show a tendency to settle well , bring back to boiling and continue the stirring .
Let settle 20 min .
and filter through No .
42 , 110 mm .
Whatman filters or paper of an equivalent grade .
Wash free from oxalate and chloride with hot water .
Wash the precipitate back into the original beaker and dilute to about 100 ml .
Dissolve the precipitate with 10 to 15 ml of diluted H 2SO4 ( 1:4 ) heat to about 80oC , and titrate to a pink colour with 0.1 N KmNO4 .
Add the paper , and finish the titration to a faint pink with the standard KmNO4 .
C Calculation .

6.4.3 Total Alkalinity and Magnesium Compounds .
Weigh accurately a 10.00 g sample ( Note 1 ) , place in a 400 ml beaker , and dissolve in 25 ml of water .
Add a drop of phenolphthalein indicator , and titrate with 0.1 N HCl until the brilliant pink colour fades or becomes a dull , slowly-returning colour when tested by adding another drop or two of indicator .
Then add enough of the 0.1 N HCl in excess to give a permanent red colour after the addition of a drop of methyl orange indicator .
Titrate back to the neutral point with 0.1N NaOH and adjust to a faint colour with 0.1 N HCl .
Use these solutions for the subsequent determination of magnesium compounds .
The net volume of acid used is sometimes calculated as calcium hydroxide for convenience , as follows : C % of Ca ( OH ) 2 = ml of 0.1 N HCl x 0.0037 x 10 To the neutral solutions add 9 ml of 1 N NaOH which will precipitate Mg ( OH ) 2 along with some Ca ( OH ) 2 .
Filter the precipitate and transfer as much as possible to the filter .
Dissolve the precipitate from the paper to the original beaker with about 10 ml of HCl ( 1:1 ) .
Add 30 ml of cold saturated NH4Cl .

42 Whatman paper of equivalent quality , and wash with cold NH4OH ( 1:10 ) .
Ignite to constant weight and weigh as Mg 2P2O7 .
If the alkalinity is appreciable and the total magnesium low , this should be calculated as Mg ( OH ) 2 .
Any balance of magnesium over total alkalinity would be MgCl 2 .
CC Calculations .
Calculate the percentage of Mg ( OH ) 2 as follows : % of Mg ( OH ) 2 = grams of Mg 2P2O7 x 0.524 x 10 % of Mg ( OH ) 2 x 34.3 = ml of 0.1 N HCl due to Mg ( OH ) 2 If the alkalinity titration with phenolphthalein was stopped and the millilitres recorded when the brilliant pink faded , the millilitres represent actual Ca ( OH ) 2 present , as follows : % of Ca ( OH ) 2 = ml of 0.1 N HCl x 0.0037 x 10 The difference ( millilitres for methyl orange end point minus millilitres for phenolphthalein end point ) minus millilitres due to Mg ( OH ) 2 equals the millilitres due to CaCO3 as follows : % of CaCO3 = ml of 0.1 N HCl due to CaCO3 x 0.0050 Division 6 Miscellaneous Section 8 Calcium Chloride February 1 , 1997 6-8-3 x 10 % as CaCl2 = ( ml for Ca ( OH ) 2 + ml for CaCO 3 ) x 0.00555 x 10 Deduct this latter percentage from total calcium as net CaCl 2 .
6.4.4 Total Alkali Chlorides as Sodium Chloride .
The chlorides KCl and NaCl shall be determined together .
Where it is desired to distinguish between them , the potassium may be determined by any standard method and the two reported separately .
The perchlorate method may be used for this determination .
For routine work the KCl and NaCl shall be reported as NaCl .
The method used shall be as follows : Dissolve an 8.000 g sample ( Note 2 ) in 50 ml of hot water , add 1 g of reagent grade Ca ( OH ) 2 , mix well , and boil gently for 1 min .
Dilute to exactly 100 ml in a volumetric flask .
Filter through a dry paper , discarding the first 10 ml , pipette a 25.00 ml aliquot , add 20 ml of water ; heat to boiling and add 50 ml of hot ( NH4 ) 2C2O4 ( 5 % ) or ( NH4 ) CO3 ( 4 % ) -preferably the latter .
Dilute to 100 ml and mix well .
Let stand until the temperature is about that of the room and adjust the volume .
Finally , filter through a dry retentative filter paper , discarding the first 10 ml and refiltering if cloudy .
Pipette a 25.00 ml aliquot in a 250 ml beaker and add 1 ml of HCl ( sp.gr.1.19 ) .
Evaporate to dryness on a steam bath .
Thoroughly ignite in a muffle or heat-treating furnace ( Note 3 ) at 300 to 350EC .
In about 30 min. , organic and ammonium salts should have been driven off .
Cool , dissolve in 10 ml of water , add 3 drops of Na 2CrO4 or K2CrO4 ( 5 % ) solution as indicator , and titrate with 0.02 N AgNO 3 ( Note 4 ) to a pink end point .
If the ignition was correctly done , there will be but little brown or yellow colouration due to charred organic residue with seeing the end point .
Run a blank on the reagents used .
If this is less than 0.5 ml neglect it , if over 0.5 ml subtract from the titration after deducting 0.5 ml ( 1.00 ml of 0.02 N AgNO3 is equivalent to 0.00117 g. NaCl ) .
In the method as given , 0.500g of sample is finally titrated .
C Calculation .
Calculate the total alkali chlorides as sodium chloride as follows : % of NaCl = ml of 0.02 N AgNO2 x 0.00117x1.05 x 100 0.500 or % of NaCl = ml of 0.02 N AgNO3 x 0.246 6.4.5 Rapid Technical Method .
For ordinary purposes , where the quantity of material purchased does not warrant the employment of the foregoing method of analysis , calcium chloride will be deemed as the satisfactory if the total chlorides present , determined by titration with 0.1 N AgNO3 and calculated to CaCl 2 , is in excess of 78 % and if not more than a slight precipitate of Mg ( OH ) 2 appears when a 10 % filtered solution of the material is made alkaline with NH 4OH .
No material shall be rejected under this technical method of analysis , and in case the calcium chloride tested by this rapid procedure does not conform to the specifications , it shall analyzed by the methods described in Subsection 6.4.2 to 6.4.4 of this specification .
C Explanatory Notes Note 1 : If a large amount of MgCl 2 ( 2 or 3 % ) is present , the calculation of CaCO3 will be inaccurate .
Note 2 : Instead of weighing separate samples as indicated in Subsections 6.4.2 to 6.4.4 a 50 g sample may be dissolved and diluted to 500 ml in a volumetric flask with distilled water .
For the procedure in Subsection 6.4.2 , pipette a 50 ml aliquot into another 500 ml volumetric flash and dilute to volume .
From this second flask , containing 5 g of original sample , pipette a 25 ml aliquot as indicated in Subsection 6.4.2 and continue the procedure for total calcium as outlined .
For the procedure in Subsection 6.4.3 , measure for alkalinity and magnesium compounds .
For the procedure in Subsection 6.4.4 , measure 80 ml of solution from a burette , which will represent 8 g of sample for the alkali chlorides .
This handling will render accurate distribution of the insoluble Mg ( OH ) 2 and CaCO3 present more difficult than using direct weighted samples .
However , if each volumetric flask is well mixed before each portion is removed , fairly accurate results can be expected .
Instead of weighing accurately a 10.00 gram sample , a sample of approximately 10 grams may be used if desired , in which case the percentage of Ca ( OH ) 2 may be calculated as follows : % of Ca ( OH ) 2 = ml of 0.1 N HCl x 0.0037 x 100 weight of sample in grams Note 3 : In case a muffle or furnace with close heat control is not available , a moderate bunsen flame played over the beaker may be used to volatize the ammonium and organic compounds .
In this case it Division 6 Miscellaneous Section 8 Calcium Chloride February 1 , 1997 6-8-4 would be advisable to control the determination by means of a known mixture having NaCl present in the same magnitude .
Note 4 : The 0.02 N AgNO3 may be conveniently made by diluting 50.00 ml of exactly 0.1 N solution to a 250 ml volume .
There is empirical correction to be made on the factor which amounts to the 0.02 N value being multiplied by about 1.05 .
This can be determined exactly by running on known mixtures having the same magnitude and composition as the calcium chloride to be analyzed .

The Contractor has the option of submitting only one VEA for Preliminary Design Review , either with the bid or up to ten working days after the tender is awarded .
The VEA will not be considered when awarding the tender .
The VEA may be accepted or rejected by the Department at its sole discretion .
The proposing of any design does not place the Department under any obligation to accept the design .
Net construction savings will be shared equally between the Contractor and the Department .
Minimum overall savings will be identified , confirmed and fixed prior to the Department giving approval to a VEA .
Changes which require different right-of-way limits or proposals involving work outside the scope of the tendered contract will not be considered as an acceptable VEA .
The VEA Review will be divided into three stages .
Where a VEA is proposed , the Contractor has the option of submitting an informal Concept Submission , in which only a general description of the work is required .
Should the Concept Submission be acceptable the Contractor will then submit a Preliminary Design , which requires a review by the Department to ensure it meets the requirements as specified .
If the Preliminary Design review is satisfactory , the Contractor shall complete a Detailed Design as specified .
The Contractor shall be responsible for costs associated with reviewing and evaluating the VEA as follows : • Concept Submission Review ( optional ) - There will be no cost associated with this step in the procedure .
• Preliminary Design Review - At the time that the preliminary design is submitted , the Contractor shall provide a certified cheque in the amount of $ 2,000.00 .
• Detailed Design Review - At the detailed design review stage , the Contractor shall provide a certified cheque in the amount of $ 8,000.00 .
The costs of the VEA , listed above , will be returned to the Contractor after final acceptance of his VEA .
Should the VEA be disapproved , at any stage , all monies submitted will be retained by the Department .
The VEA proposal does not relieve the Contractor of any other contractual obligations .
2.0 Preliminary Design Review To enable the Department to assess a VEA , the following minimum information shall be provided at the preliminary design review stage : • Identification of the Contractor ’ s Design Engineers including past project experience and resumes of designated individuals .
The Design Engineer of Record must be registered in the Province of Nova Scotia and meet any acceptance criteria the Department may require depending on the nature of the VEA submitted .
• Identification of the Contractor ’ s relevant experience including similar projects .
• Information specific to the VEA , in compliance with overall design criteria , in written and general arrangement drawing form , as follows : • Finished roadway elevations on , under and/or through the structure as applicable .
• Span arrangements .
• Foundation types .
• Sections showing superstructure members including deck and curb type and number , type and size of girders .
• Pier section showing pier type and details of pier foundation .
• Abutment elevation sections showing abutment type and abutment foundation .
• General description of construction erection procedure .
• General description of bearings , deck joints and bridgerail proposed .
• General description of wingwall type and geometry .
• General description of materials to be used and finish treatments .
• Design information to a level that displays a workable solution meeting project requirements .
• Realistic work schedule , including detail design and review stages , compliance with environmental restrictions and other regulatory agencies , and the effect on the project schedule completion dates .
• A detailed cost breakdown similar to the Department ’ s tendered design including unchanged and modified items/prices from the tendered design and new items/prices pertaining to the VEA .
• Life cycle cost analysis for anticipated fifty year life span .
The VEA submission shall include a VEA cover page and VEA contents page as shown later in this document .

Such delays shall not constitute grounds for a claim from the Contractor .
5.2 Profile Measurements .
The profiler will conduct three ( 3 ) complete passes in each lane , recording the right and left wheel path IRI values simultaneously at 10 metre intervals .
The final IRI will be the average of the three passes reported at 10 metre intervals .
The 100 metre interval averages will then be computed from the 10 metre interval average IRI values .
The point at skewed pavement locations where testing will start / end will be the where the full pavement width occurs across all lanes including paved shoulders .
5.3 Exclusions .
The 10 metre segments at both ends of the section under contract will be excluded from smoothness calculations .
Bridges , underpass structures and overpass structures located within any 10 metre segment , including the 10 metre segments immediately before and after the structure shall be excluded from payment adjustments under this specification .
Individual contract sections less than 500 metres in length or areas requiring hand work , tapers , intersections , gore areas , aprons , etc .
will be excluded from this specification .
Individual 10 metre segments exhibiting roughness , which can be directly attributed to physical features of the roadway including iron works or curb/gutter match-ins , will be excluded from payment adjustments .
6.0 PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS The Engineer will provide the Contractor with a copy of the smoothness test results , including detailed payment adjustment summaries and Compulsory Corrective Work requirements , within 10 calendar days of original smoothness testing .
6.1 100 Metre Segments .

The total payment adjustment shall be the summation of all the individual payment adjustments for each 100 metre segment in each lane , including localized roughness payment adjustments .
If the total 100 metre segment payment adjustment is a positive value ( bonus ) , the Contractor will be assessed the total 100 metre segment payment adjustment , and the total localized roughness payment adjustment for the defined section of roadway .
The corresponding amount will be paid to the Contractor on the final estimate .
If the total 100 metre segment payment adjustment is a negative value ( penalty ) , the Contractor will be assessed either the total 100 metre segment payment adjustment or the total localized roughness payment adjustment , whichever is numerically less ( i.e .
whichever results in a greater penalty to the Contractor ) .
The two penalties shall not be applied in summation .
The corresponding amount will be recovered from the Contractor on the final estimate .
6.4 Segments Less Than 100 Metres .
For segments less than 100 metres in length , price adjustments will be determined from 10 metre segments that are not subject to exclusions as described in Item 5.3 .
Payment adjustments under Item 6.1 and Item 6.2 shall apply to these areas based on the actual number of 10 metre segments that are not excluded .
Price adjustments shall be prorated based on the number of non-excluded 10 metre segments in the 100 metre segment , as detailed in Table 6.1 .
