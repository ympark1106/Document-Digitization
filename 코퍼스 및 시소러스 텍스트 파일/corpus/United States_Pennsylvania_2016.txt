110.02 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS , SUSPENSIONS OF WORK , AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF WORK— ( a ) General .
If differing site conditions , changes in quantities , or alterations of the construction drawings will significantly increase or decrease the cost of performing the work directly affected , perform such work only when authorized in writing , as specified in Section 110.03 ( a ) .
Payment for such work will be made as specified in Section 110.03 .
( b ) Differing Site Conditions .
During the progress of the work , if subsurface or latent physical conditions , differing materially from those indicated , are encountered at the site , or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature , differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work , are encountered at the site , the party discovering such conditions is responsible for promptly notifying the other party , in writing , of the specific differing conditions , before the site is disturbed and before the affected work is performed .
Upon written notification , the Representative will investigate the conditions , and if it is determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the contract , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made as specified in Section 110.02 ( a ) .
The Representative will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted .
No contract adjustment that results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice .
No contract adjustment will be allowed under this section for any effects caused on unchanged work .
( c ) Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Representative .
If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the Representative in writing , as specified in Section 107.16 ( c ) , for an unreasonable period of time ( not originally anticipated , customary , or inherent to the construction industry ) and the Contractor believes 110.02 ( c ) 110.03 ( a ) 110 – 2 Change No .
4 that additional compensation and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay , submit to the Representative , in writing , a request for adjustment within 7 calendar days of receipt of the notice to resume work .
Set forth the reasons , and support for such adjustment , in the request .
Upon receipt , the Representative will evaluate the Contractor 's request .
If the Representative agrees that the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor , its suppliers , or subcontractors , and not caused by weather , the Representative will make an adjustment , excluding profit , as specified in Section 110.03 and Section 108.06 , as applicable .
The Representative will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted .
No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed .
No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause , or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded as specified in Section 107.16 ( c ) .
( d ) Required Changes in the Scope of Work .
The Department reserves the right to make , in writing , at any time , such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project .
Such changes in quantities and alterations in the work will neither invalidate the contract or release the surety , and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as changed or altered .
If alterations in the work or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the contract , the work will be paid for at the original contract unit price .
If alterations in the work or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the contract , whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such other work to become significantly different in character , an adjustment , excluding loss of anticipated profits , will be made as specified in Section 110.03 .
The basis for the adjustment will be agreed upon before the performance of the work .
If a basis can not be agreed upon , the work will be paid for as extra work as specified in Section 110.03 .
The term “ significant change in character ” applies only to the following circumstances : • If the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction , or • If any major item of work as defined in Section 101 is increased to in excess of 125 % or decreased to below 75 % of the original contract quantity .
Any allowance for an increase in quantity applies only to that portion in excess of 125 % of the original contract item quantity or , in case of a decrease below 75 % , to the actual quantity of work performed .
When a contract item experiences a significant change in character as a result of a decrease to below 75 % of the original contract quantity , the actual quantity of work performed may be paid at an adjusted price , as agreed upon with the Contractor and as approved ; however , total compensation will not exceed the contract item ’ s original value .
Item value is defined as the original contract quantity multiplied by the contract unit price .
( e ) Adjustment of Lump Sum Items .
The original contract price for a lump sum item , where quantities and unit prices for component items are designated on a component item schedule submitted as specified in Section 103.01 ( a ) , will be adjusted only if differing site conditions , as specified in Section 110.02 ( b ) , or changes directed by the Representative will significantly increase or decrease the cost of performing the work .
If the Representative determines that conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time for performance of the work , or if increases or decreases in quantities are required due to a change directed by the Representative , adjusted payment will be made as specified in Section 110.03 .
110.03 ADDITIONAL WORK , EXTRA WORK , AND EXTRA WORK ON A FORCE ACCOUNT BASIS— ( a ) General .
Work specified in Sections 104.02 and 104.03 will be paid , if authorized in writing by the District Executive , as additional work , extra work , or extra work on a force account basis .
Compensation will be limited to the work authorized in writing and actually performed .
Work performed before written authorization will be at the Contractor 's risk .
A work order identifying the work to be done and the price to be paid therefore will be processed before or during 110.03 ( a ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 3 Change No .
4 the performance of the work .
To avoid interrupting the project , written authorization to perform work under this section will be in the form of a letter , telegram , mailgram , or other writing from the District Executive , or the Inspector-in-Charge , in writing to the Contractor when confirming an oral authorization of the District Executive , issued within a reasonable length of time .
If the work is to be paid as additional work , the District Executive ’ s writing will refer to the contract price for that work .
If the work is to be paid as extra work and : • is such that a reasonable price therefore can be negotiated , and • is such that force account records , if necessary , can be kept by the Department , the District Executive ’ s writing will authorize commencement of work as extra work .
Within 10 calendar days of such authorization , submit a price for the extra work with back-up data to the District Executive for transmittal to the Representative .
Pending approval of the price , force account records will be kept as stated below .
If the price is accepted , the work will be paid only at the negotiated price , which will not be renegotiated once submitted for acceptance .
If the work is to be paid as extra work and : • the Contractor and District Executive can not agree on a tentative price , therefore , and • the work is such that force account records can not be kept by the Department , the District Executive ’ s writing will contain a firm , binding price determined by the District Executive to be fair and equitable for the work to be performed .
If the District Executive and Contractor can not agree on a tentative price for the extra work and if the work is such that force account records can be kept by the Department , the District Executive 's writing will state that such work is to be paid on a force account basis .
Force account records will be kept as stated below .
Payment for additional work , extra work , and extra work on a force account basis is accepted as payment in full for all profit and for all equipment , labor , material , field overhead , home office and general administrative expenses , and every other expense incurred as a result of the additional or extra work .

110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 4 Change No .
4 Upon receipt of written authorization to perform force account work , schedule a meeting with the Representative to discuss any concerns regarding the work itself , as well as expectations regarding reimbursement for the associated costs .
Topics of discussion at this meeting should include , but are not limited to , the availability of needed materials or equipment ; expectations regarding reimbursement for off-site labor , “ show up ” time , travel time , and/or paid non- working holidays ; payment of standby time for owned equipment ; the need to rent equipment ; the need for consumables and whether they will be purchased or taken from stock ; and the availability of needed subcontractors and the incurring of costs for overnight travel .
The Department will keep records of extra work done on a force account basis .
Compare force account records with those kept by the Department , at the end of each day or as directed , to ensure accuracy and obtain concurrence .
Report any unresolved disagreements with such records to the Representative .
Failure to review the Department ’ s records or to report disagreements with such records will create a presumption that the Department ’ s records are complete and accurate .
Payment for extra work performed on a force account basis will be made , as specified herein , upon completion of the work .
Progress payments will be made only when an itemized estimated force account of cost is provided , in writing , within 10 working days after receipt of the Department ’ s written authorization to perform the extra work on a force account basis .
1 .
Labor .
Wages of forepersons ; equipment operators ; and skilled , semiskilled , and common laborers directly assigned to the specific operation or directly involved in the off-site handling , loading , and transportation of material , equipment , and/or purchased consumables needed specifically for the force account work will be reimbursed , as direct labor , at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid , for each hour that such employees are engaged in the performance of authorized work and , if directed , overtime as provided for in existing laws , regulations collective bargaining agreements , or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of labor employed in the work .
The workforce utilized and hours paid for off-site handling , loading , and transportation must be mutually agreed upon as being fair and reasonable given the nature and scope of the force account work .
Additionally , if a labor crew assigned to the force account operation arrives on the job site and is not permitted to perform work of any kind ( i.e .
contract work , Additional Work , or Extra Work ) due to circumstances beyond its control , payment of “ show up ” time as provided for in an existing collective bargaining agreement or employment contract will be reimbursed as direct labor at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid .
Reimbursement for the payment of reasonable travel time from a central meeting location to the site of the force account work and/or for non- working paid holidays may be made at the actual wage rate and fringe benefit rate paid if it is mutually agreed that such costs are unavoidable and being incurred for the convenience of the Department .
Additionally , with regard to reimbursement for non-working paid holidays , the Contractor must show that the payment is required by existing laws , regulations , collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts , or being made in accordance with an established , written company policy , and that any prerequisite or post requisite work hours were earned completely in the performance of the force account work .
Finally , if a worker in a given labor classification is engaged in the performance of work not of the type typically performed by individuals in that classification , and there is an OSHA requirement for specific Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) to be used by individuals performing such work , the cost of the required PPE will be reimbursed as purchased consumables as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 5.a .
Indirect labor costs will be paid , without markup , as a percentage of the total base labor cost , as supported by certified payroll records and , when required , a fringe benefit letter .
The total base labor cost will be the total amount paid directly to the force account workforce based on the actual wage rate paid each individual worker , which is to include that portion of the worker ’ s fringe benefit rate also paid directly , if any .
Any amount paid on behalf of the members of the force account workforce as tax exempt fringe benefits will not be included in the indirect labor cost computation .
Allowable indirect labor costs include the following : • Social Security Tax at the percentage legally required ; • Medicare Tax at the percentage legally required ; • Unemployment Taxes at the estimated effective rate computed as specified below ; • Workers ’ Compensation Insurance at the rate computed as specified below ; and • Liability Insurance at the current , policy period rate used to account for the cost of applicable Liability Insurance provided as specified in Sections 103.05 and 107.14 .
Update the liability rate annually in 110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 5 Change No .
4 ECMS prior to the start of each new policy period .
The Liability Insurance rate entered into ECMS is to be accompanied by a certification attesting to the fact that the rate being charged for Liability Insurance for force account work does not exceed the applicable , current policy period rate used when determining unit prices for bidding purposes during the policy period .
Maintain appropriate records needed to verify the certification for audit purposes , including bid documents , records of all payments , rate computations , and policy statements , in accordance with the provisions of Section 112.C Contractors and subcontractors are to compute their company ’ s estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes for the current calendar year by dividing total , company-wide , Pennsylvania and Federal Unemployment Tax payments for the prior calendar year by the total wages and salaries reported for applicable employees for the same period .
The tax payment , wage , and salary amounts used to compute the estimated effective rate are to be consistent with the information reported on Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation tax forms filed with the Department of Labor and Industry and on Federal Unemployment Tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service .
Each employer reports its state and federal unemployment tax payments under a unique account or identification number representing the company and all employees for whom unemployment taxes must be paid .
The gross wages and unemployment tax contribution reported on PA Form UC-2 under the employer ’ s PA UC account number , along with the total payments to all employees and FUTA tax liability reported on Form 940 under the company ’ s Employer Identification Number ( EIN ) , are considered company-wide amounts representing all applicable employees for the purpose of computing the company ’ s estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes .
A company ’ s estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes is to be recomputed by April 15 of each calendar year based on the prior calendar year ’ s reported total wages and salaries and total tax payments .
Contractors and subcontractors are to compute their company ’ s Workers ’ Compensation Insurance rate based on an average of applicable policy premium costs ; amounts paid or credited for deductibles , loss claims , and retrospective adjustments ; and actual payroll basis over the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods .
The average of the policy premium amount established by the insurance carrier during its end-of-policy period , premium adjustment audit for each of the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods is to be added to the average of the total amount paid during the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods for deductibles and/or to settle loss claims , and the average of the total amount paid to or credited by an insurance carrier ( current or prior ) during the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods as retrospective adjustments to policies in effect during prior policy periods , dividing by the average of the applicable Payroll Basis for the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods , and multiplying the result by 100 .
The term “ policy periods ” as used herein is defined as the period of time covered by the last five , consecutive Workers ’ Compensation Insurance policies for which an end-of-policy period , premium adjustment audit was completed .
When determining the policy premium amount for each year and its associated Payroll Basis , only the portion of each that is attributable to the company ’ s field or project-based workforce need be included .
The portion of each that is attributable to the company ’ s clerical or sales workforce may be excluded .
Additionally , any premium amount and associated Payroll Basis that is attributable to a company workforce employed in a state other than PA may be excluded .
As support for the Worker ’ s Compensation Insurance rate being charged , provide a copy of the last five , consecutive , end-of-policy period Audit Adjustment statements prepared by the insurance carrier and ensure each statement indicates the Payroll Basis upon which the adjusted premium was based .
Additionally , provide a schedule ( i.e .
spreadsheet ) of applicable deductible and claim payments made during the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods and include , at a minimum , the amount , payment date , and invoice number for each payment .
Finally , provide a schedule of applicable payments made and credits received during the last five , consecutive , complete policy periods as retrospective adjustments and include , at a minimum , the amount , the payment/credit date , and the policy period to which each adjustment is applicable .
If a company involved in the performance of force account work has not been in business long enough to compute its Workers ’ Compensation Insurance rate based on an average of five , consecutive , complete policy periods of cost data , compute the company ’ s Workers ’ Compensation Insurance rate based on average cost data from all available , consecutive , complete policy periods .
Contractors and subcontractors will be required to enter their company ’ s estimated effective rate for unemployment taxes into ECMS , along with required supporting documentation , prior to April 15th of each calendar year .
Additionally , Contractors and subcontractors will be required to enter and their computed Workers ’ Compensation Insurance and Liability Insurance rates into ECMS , along with the applicable expiration date for each type of coverage , prior to the start of each new insurance policy period .
Supporting documentation demonstrating that the Workers ’ Compensation Insurance rate entered into ECMS was computed as specified above will be required , as will the required Liability Insurance rate certification .
The coverage expiration date information will be tracked by ECMS and used to prompt the Contractor or subcontractor to update its rate information as existing policy periods expire .
110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 6 Change No .
4 2 .
Material .
An item or product purchased specifically for the force account work that becomes a permanent part of the completed work will be considered a material for reimbursement purposes .
The cost of material used will be reimbursable , including applicable sales tax and transportation costs charged by the material supplier .
3 .
Equipment .
Reasonable rental rates for equipment , including trucks and machinery , mutually considered necessary , will be allowed , computed as follows : 3.a Owned Equipment .
The term “ owned equipment ” , as used herein , applies to equipment ( including trucks and machinery ) that the Contractor is required to provide for the proper execution of the original contract work , as specified in Section 108.05 ( c ) , whether such equipment is actually owned by the Contractor , is leased ( rented ) , or has been obtained in some other manner .
For any owned equipment used in the performance of force account work , a rental rate will be determined using data obtained from the Rental Rate Blue Book ( aka .
EquipmentWatch Cost Recovery ) , which is published by EquipmentWatch , a division of Penton , Inc. Blue Book published data considered “ current ” as of the first day that work is performed on a specific force account is the data that will remain applicable throughout the performance of such work even if Blue Book data for an applicable piece of owned equipment is updated during that time .
Outdated Blue Book data will be voided by the Department annually , as of a specific date , and no longer accepted thereafter .
The Department utilizes the Engineering and Construction Management System ( ECMS ) to keep electronic records of force account work .
To enable the Department to electronically account for owned equipment utilized by Contractors and subcontractors in the performance of force account work within ECMS , the following actions must be taken : • Purchase a subscription to all necessary volumes of the Blue Book , in electronic format , based on the various ages of the pieces in the Contractor ’ s equipment inventory for Department projects , • Utilize the All Saved Models tool available to subscribers to create a Department project equipment inventory , • From the equipment included in the All Saved Models inventory , create an equipment Group , • Use the Group Manager tool to select the applicable equipment Group and generate a Basic Fleet Report ( i.e .
the report that lists the ID , subtype , manufacturer , model , year , serial number , and configuration , as applicable , for each piece of equipment in the Group ) , • Using the available “ CSV ” button , export the Basic Fleet Report to a spreadsheet and save the spreadsheet in a .csv ( Comma Separated Values ) file format .
Note : Do not use the available “ PDF ” button to export the Basic Fleet Report as ECMS will not allow a spreadsheet saved in .pdf format to be imported .
• At this point , if the Contractor or subcontractor ’ s owned equipment inventory includes any pieces that are not listed in the Blue Book , such equipment must be added to the spreadsheet .
When adding equipment with no Blue Book listing to the spreadsheet , care should be taken to ensure that applicable information relating to ID , subtype , manufacturer , model , year , serial number , and configuration , as it is entered , is consistent with the existing column headings .
• Log in to ECMS and import the .csv file using the “ Import Equipment ” hyperlink found on the “ Contractor Portal ” screen .
At a minimum , the equipment Group imported to ECMS must include all of the owned equipment that will be used to perform the authorized force account work on a given project .
However , to avoid having to repeat the above import procedure for future force account work on the same project or for force account work on other projects , the Contractor may elect to import a spreadsheet file that lists all of the equipment assigned to a given project or its entire Department project , owned equipment inventory .
The ECMS equipment Group import procedure may be repeated at any time ( e.g .
to import new pieces added to the inventory or to import a piece that was missed in a prior import ) .
An hourly rental rate for owned equipment will be computed by dividing the Blue Book monthly rate by 176 .
To this rate , the Blue Book area adjustment percentage for Pennsylvania and the age adjustment percentage for the 110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 7 Change No .
4 model year of the piece of equipment will be applied .
Blue Book city-level regional adjustment factors will not be used in computing an hourly rental rate for owned equipment .
An allowance will be made for operating costs by adding , to the above adjusted hourly rate , the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour , for each hour that the owned equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
If a piece of owned equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis , but is not operating , compensation , if any , will be at 50 % of the adjusted hourly rate , exclusive of operating costs .
Payment for standby time will not be made on any day a piece of owned equipment is operated the entire work day .
For a standard 8-hour work day , when equipment operates less than 8 hours , payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that , when added to the operating time for that day , equals 8 hours .
For work days that exceed 8 hours , when equipment operates less than 10 hours , payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that , when added to the operating time for that day , equals 10 .
When force account work extends into one or more full weeks , in any 1-week period payment for standby time will be limited to the number of hours that , when added to the operating time for that week , equals 40 hours , regardless of the number of hours per day or days per week the Contractor works ( i.e .
overtime , multiple shifts , etc . ) .
Payment for standby time will not be made on days the Contractor elects not to work or days not normally a work day .
Standby time will not be paid if equipment is awaiting repair , while repairs are being made , or for maintenance or servicing of equipment .
Standby time will not be paid for equipment not on the job site ( i.e .
while equipment is awaiting transport or being transported to the job site ) .
With the exception of owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic , owned equipment used on a 24-hour basis will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate , which will be determined by dividing the Blue Book monthly rate by 22 .
Owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a 24-hour basis will be reimbursed at the Blue Book daily rate .
Applicable adjustment percentages from the Blue Book will be applied .
Where owned equipment utilized in the performance of force account work is not listed in the Blue Book , a rental rate will be determined based on the sale price for such equipment at the time of purchase , if the equipment is actually owned , or the applicable lease agreement .
In these cases , for equipment that is actually owned , the monthly rate will be computed as 6 % of the sale price , and the total hourly rate determined by dividing the monthly rate by 160 , when the equipment is operating , and by 352 , when the equipment is required at the work site on a standby basis , but not operating , with no adjustment percentages applied .
For equipment that is leased , an hourly rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
Additionally , if not included in the lease cost , an allowance will be made for operating costs by adding , to the hourly rental rate , the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour for an equivalent piece of equipment for each hour the equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
The equivalence of the piece of equipment in the Blue Book listing to the piece of equipment actually used must be mutually agreed upon .
With the exception of owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic , owned equipment used on a 24-hour basis , with no listing in the Blue Book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate , which will be computed as 6 % of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by 22 , with no adjustment percentages applied .
Owned equipment used for maintenance and protection of traffic on a 24-hour basis with no listing in the Blue Book will be reimbursed at a daily rental rate , which will be computed as 15 % of the sale price for the equipment at the time of purchase divided by 22 , with no adjustment percentages applied .
If , instead of being purchased , the equipment was actually fabricated by the owner , the “ sale price ” used to determine the daily rental rate will be the owner ’ s total , documented , fabrication cost .
If equipment used on a 24-hour basis with no listing in the Blue Book is leased , whether or not the equipment is used for maintenance and protection of traffic , the daily rental rate will be determined by prorating the lease cost .
The rates established above include the cost of fuel ; oil ; lubrication ; supplies ; necessary attachments ; repairs ; overhaul and maintenance of any kind ; storage ; all costs of moving equipment on to and away from the work site , except as specified below ; and all incidentals .
If a piece of owned equipment , not already on or near the project site , is needed specifically for the force account work , the cost of moving the equipment on to and away from the work site will be reimbursed , provided the equipment will not be used immediately thereafter in the performance of original contract work .
The Department will not approve any Contractor requests for reimbursement of owned equipment costs incurred in the performance of force account work in excess of those outlined above unless such costs were mutually agreed upon , in writing , based on an acceptable cost breakdown prepared by the Contractor .
3.b Rented Equipment .
If a piece of equipment needed for the force account work is not of the type required to be provided by the Contractor for the proper execution of the original contract work , or if the piece of equipment needed is “ owned ” but not currently available , and the equipment can be obtained by rental , discuss the need to rent the equipment with the Representative and obtain approval of the rental source and the rate to be paid before renting 110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 8 Change No .
4 the equipment for the force account work .
The Department will not provide reimbursement for equipment rented without the prior knowledge and approval of the Representative .
The Contractor will be reimbursed the actual invoiced cost for rented equipment , plus the cost of transporting the equipment to and from the work site , provided transportation is not included in the rental cost and the rented equipment will not be used immediately thereafter in the performance of original contract work .
An allowance will be made for operating costs by adding , to the rental cost , the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour for each hour the rented equipment is actually in operation on the force account work .
If the rented equipment has no listing in the Blue Book , the Blue Book estimated operating cost per hour for an equivalent piece of equipment will be allowed , as mutually agreed upon .
Transportation charges for each piece of rented equipment , to and from the site of the force account work , will be paid provided : • Return charges do not exceed the delivery charges , • Haul rates do not exceed the established rates of licensed haulers , and • Charges are restricted to those units of equipment not readily available and not on or near the project .
Equipment that is rented or leased from an entity that is a division , affiliate , or subsidiary of , or that is in any other way related to , the Contractor or its parent company will be considered owned equipment for reimbursement purposes and subject to the provisions of Section 110.03 ( d ) 3.a .
4 .
Services by Others .
Specialized construction analyses , engineering services , and work not considered subcontract work requiring prequalification will be considered services by others for reimbursement purposes .
Additionally , when required exclusively for the force account work , as directed , the securing of permits , bonds , and specialized insurance coverage , of a type not already required by the contract , will be considered a service by others .
The Contractor will be reimbursed the actual invoiced cost of each service by others ; including allowable permit fees , bond premiums , and insurance premiums ; plus 5 % to cover administration and all other costs .
The markup on service by others costs will be limited to 5 % only , regardless of whether the service was arranged by the Contractor or a subcontractor performing any or all of the force account work .
The overhead and profit allowances specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 7 are not applicable to service by others costs .
5 .
Consumables .
An item needed specifically for the force account work that does not become a permanent part of the completed work , the useful life of which is either fully or partially expended in the performance of the work , will be considered a consumable for reimbursement purposes .
Reimbursement for consumable items will be determined as follows : 5.a Purchased Consumables .
If a consumable item needed for the force account work is purchased ( new ) , as evidenced by a supporting invoice , and the item ’ s useful life is completely expended in the performance of the work , as mutually agreed upon by the Representative and the Contractor , the full cost of the item will be reimbursed , including applicable sales tax and transportation costs .
Otherwise , that portion of the item ’ s useful life expended in the performance of the force account work will be determined , as mutually agreed upon by the Representative and the Contractor , and reimbursement made at a prorated cost .
In such cases , the purchase price of the item plus applicable sales tax will be prorated , with applicable transportation costs being reimbursed in full .
5.b Consumables Taken From Stock .
If one or more of the items shown in Table A is needed for the force account work and is not purchased ( new ) but rather obtained from the Contractor ’ s existing inventory of used consumables , the item will be considered as being taken from stock .
Given the fact that the usage history of these items can not always be accurately assessed by the Department , reimbursement will be made based on the percentage of value and payment frequency specified in Table A .
When utilizing Table A to compute reimbursement for a consumable taken from stock , item value will be established based on a supporting invoice .
The supporting invoice must show the purchase of the item ( new or used ) , from a vendor regularly engaged in the sale of such items .
Reimbursement based on the percentage of value in Table A includes the cost of off-site handling and loading the consumable ( e.g .
at the Contractor ’ s yard ) .
Applicable transportation costs to the project site ( i.e .
labor and equipment costs ) will be reimbursed separately .
All consumables taken from stock remain the Contractor ’ s property upon completion of the force account work .
No additional payment will be made for a consumable taken from stock if the 110.03 ( d ) 110.03 ( d ) 110 – 9 Change No .
4 Contractor elects to leave the item in place for its own convenience .

6 .
Subcontracting .
If any or all of the force account work is to be performed by an approved subcontractor , the work must be considered subcontract work requiring prequalification and the Contractor ’ s need to subcontract the work must be approved .
Payment for work performed by a subcontractor , will be determined based on a complete statement of applicable material , labor , and equipment costs , computed as specified herein , plus applicable markups for overhead and profit .
If a subcontractor ’ s workforce must be in overnight travel status while performing force account work , any costs incurred for hotel rooms , per diem , subsistence , travel allowance , or any other similar expense may be reimbursed , provided it is mutually agreed that such costs are unavoidable and being incurred for the convenience of the Department .
Overnight travel costs , when agreed to , will be reimbursed as service by others , as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 4 .
7 .
Overhead and Profit .
Except for work considered to be service by others , as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 4 , to cover all administration , general and project superintendence , other overhead , bonds , insurance , anticipated profit , and use of small tools and equipment for which no rental is allowed ( i.e .
tools and/or equipment having a sale price at the time of purchase of $ 1,000 or less ) , 15 % will be added to the total material cost , 30 % will be added to the total direct labor cost , and 5 % will be added to the total cost of equipment rented as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 3.b , and the total cost of consumables provided as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 5 .
If applicable , in addition to the above markups , 5 % will be added to the total cost of any force account work performed as approved subcontract work as specified in Section 110.03 ( d ) 6 .

Statements of labor costs are to be supported by certified payroll records .
If certified payroll records do not indicate the fringe benefit rate being paid , furnish a notarized statement , on company letterhead paper , listing the total fringe benefit rate for each applicable labor classification , showing how the total rate is proportioned and distributed , and identifying the portion of the rate , if any , that is being paid directly to individual workers , which would be subject to payroll taxes and therefore considered part of the base labor cost .
If a salaried working foreman is involved in the force account work and the Contractor elects not to include that individual on certified payroll records , furnish an affidavit certifying that the individual ’ s combined salary and benefit package is equivalent to or exceeds the wage and fringe benefit rates being charged .
Statements of material costs ( including sales tax and transportation costs ) , rented equipment costs , consumables costs , and service by others costs are to be supported and accompanied by invoices , receipts , or canceled checks .
If materials used in the force account work are not specifically purchased for the work but are taken from the Contractor ’ s stock or provided by entities that are divisions , affiliates , subsidiaries or in any other way related to the Contractor or its parent company , and a supporting invoice , receipt , or canceled check can not be provided , furnish an affidavit certifying that the materials were obtained as described above , that the quantity claimed was actually used , and that the price and transportation costs claimed were actually incurred .
If the Contractor fails to furnish the required itemized statement of the cost of force account work , detailed as specified , within 90 calendar days after completion of the force account work , final payment for the work will be made based on the daily force account records kept by the Department .
In such cases , since the Department will be unable to verify the prices paid for materials , rented equipment , consumables , and services by others due to the Contractor ’ s failure to provide supporting invoices , receipts , or canceled checks , the total cost of unsupported material , rented equipment , consumables , and/or services by others will be fully discounted and not included in the final payment amount .
When the required itemized statement of the cost of the force account work , detailed as specified , is furnished within 90 calendar days after completion of the force account work , the Department will review the submission and notify the Contractor , in writing , within 14 calendar days , regarding all corrections that must be made and all outstanding support documentation that must be provided .

If the Contractor fails to furnish a properly completed and fully supported statement of the cost of force account work within the 14-calendar day period , final payment for the work will be made based on the Contractor ’ s original submission and the daily force account records kept by the Department .
In such cases , the total cost of any material , rented equipment , consumables , and/or services by others for which a supporting invoice , receipt , or canceled check has not been furnished will be fully discounted and not included in the final payment amount .
Extension ( s ) of either of the above 14-calendar day periods will be made only by mutual written consent of the parties to the contract provided such written consent is given before the expiration of the applicable 14-day period .
If the amount already paid to the Contractor via progress payments exceeds the final payment amount computed after discounting unsupported material , rented equipment , consumables , and/or service by others costs , the overpayment amount will be recouped through the processing of a negative Force Account Adjustment .
The Contractor ’ s failure to submit all required supporting invoices , receipts , or canceled checks , releases and forever discharges the Department from any claims relating to the act of discounting the cost of unsupported material , rented equipment , and/or services by others before making final payment for force account work .

The price index in the proposal , FB , will be the index price posted by the Department , determined as specified above , for the month in which the project is advertised .
The price index at the time of performance , FP , will be the index price posted by the Department , determined as specified above , for the month during which applicable contract work is performed .
( c ) Price Adjustment Criteria and Conditions .
The following criteria and conditions will be considered in determining a price adjustment for diesel fuel cost fluctuations .
1 .
No Price Adjustment .
When the ratio FP/FB falls within the range of 0.95 to 1.05 , no price adjustment will be made for any diesel fuel consumed in construction work performed during the relevant month .
2 .
Price Rebate .
When the ratio FP/FB is calculated to be less than 0.95 , the Department will receive an automatic price rebate determined in accordance with the following formula : P.R .
= ( 0.95 - FP/FB ) ( Q ) ( FB ) ( F ) where : P.R .
= Price Rebate FP = Price Index for the month during which the diesel fuel is consumed in the performance of applicable construction work .
FB = Price Index in the Proposal Q = Quantity of eligible Category items as reported on current Estimates .
Item quantities will be converted , as necessary , to agree with the units associated with the applicable Diesel Fuel Usage Factor .
F = Diesel Fuel Usage Factor 3 .
Price Increase .
When the ratio FP/FB is calculated to be greater than 1.05 , the Contractor will receive a price increase to be determined in accordance with the following formula : P.I .
= ( FP/FB - 1.05 ) ( Q ) ( FB ) ( F ) where : P.I .
= Price Increase FP = Price Index for month during which the diesel duel is consumed in the performance of applicable construction work .
FB = Price Index in the Proposal Q = Quantity of eligible Category items as reported on current Estimates .
Item quantities will be converted , as necessary , to agree with the units associated with the applicable Diesel Fuel Usage Factor 110.12 ( c ) 110.13 ( c ) 110 – 29 Change No .
4 F = Diesel Fuel Usage Factor 4 .
Payment/Rebate .
The price adjustment will be paid , or rebated , upon approval of a contract adjustment to be prepared on a quarterly basis .
Quarterly price adjustments amounting to less than $ 1,000 will be disregarded .
5 .
Expiration of Contract Time .
When eligible items of work are performed after expiration of contract time and liquidated damages are chargeable the value of FP used to compute the price adjustment will be either the Price Index at the time of actual performance or the Price Index at the time contract time expired , whichever is less .
6 .
Final Quantities .
Upon completion of the work and determination of final pay quantities , a final contract adjustment may be prepared to reconcile any difference between estimated quantities previously paid and the final pay quantities .
In this situation , the value for FP used in the price adjustment formula will be the average of all FP ' s previously used for computing price adjustments .
7 .
Inspection of Records .
The Department , through the Office of Inspector General , reserves the right to inspect the records of the prime contractor and its subcontractors and material suppliers to ascertain actual pricing and cost information for the diesel fuel used in the performance of applicable items of work .
8 .
Extra Work .
When applicable items of work , as specified herein , are added to the contract as Extra Work , as specified in Section 110.03 , no price adjustment will be made for fluctuations in the cost of diesel fuel consumed in the performance of the extra work , unless otherwise approved by the Representative at the time written authorization to perform the extra work is submitted .
The current price for diesel fuel is to be used when preparing required backup data for extra work to be performed at a negotiated price .
For extra work performed on force account basis , reimbursement for material , equipment , and service by others costs along with specified overhead and profit markups will be considered to include full compensation for the current cost of diesel fuel .
110.13 EVALUATION , DISPOSITION , AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT OF LOW STRENGTH PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS ( a ) General .
Low strength precast concrete products will be evaluated using the compressive strength of concrete core test specimens .
This policy applies to non prestressed precast concrete products where the minimum structural design strength is equal to the 28-day minimum concrete compressive strength .
Where precast concrete products are designed with a minimum structural concrete strength less than the 28-day minimum compressive strength , evaluation and disposition will be in accordance with Section 110.10 .
( b ) Definitions .
• F ’ ( 28-day ) .
28-day minimum concrete compressive strength ( pounds per square inch ) , as specified on the Standard Drawings or on the approved shop drawings .
• F ’ ( cyl ) .
28-day concrete compressive strength ( pounds per square inch ) of acceptance cylinders representing the lot of precast concrete products .
Determined as the average of the compressive strength of two or more cylinders .
• F ’ ( cores ) .
Concrete compressive strength ( pounds per square inch ) of acceptance cores extracted from the precast concrete products .
Determined as the average compressive strength of all cores from the lot as determined according to PTM No .
606 .
• Lot .
One shifts production and produced from a single mix design at the same water/cement ratio .
( c ) Evaluation and Disposition of Low Strength Precast Concrete Products Using Cores .
If F ’ ( cyl ) , representing a specific lot of precast concrete products , fails to meet the F ’ ( 28-day ) for the specific product , the lot of precast concrete products will be considered deficient .
Request permission from the Chief Structural Materials Engineer , in writing , to extract cores from the deficient lot within 2 working days following testing and determination that F ’ ( cyl ) < F ’ ( 28-day ) Obtain cores under the direction and supervision of the Representative or his or her designate within 2 working days following authorization for coring 110.13 ( c ) 110.13 ( d ) 110 – 30 Change No .

Moisture , Density , and Acceptance Testing .
For materials placed and compacted as specified in Sections 206.3 ( b ) 1.a and 1.b , determine the in-place moisture and density in accordance with PTM No .
402 using the direct transmission method .
All other materials will be accepted based on a condition of non-movement , as determined by the Representative .
Provide a Nuclear Density/Moisture Gauge calibrated according to AASHTO T 310 .
PTM No .
418 may be used if the gauge is manufactured by Troxler ( Note : PTM No .
418 is written for Troxler manufactured gauges while AASHTO T 310 is generic to any nuclear density gauge ) .
Gauges must be calibrated every 12 months .
A sheet with the current annual calibration providing the projected monthly decay standard with upper and lower limits must be kept with every gauge .
Use Form TR-4276A located in PTM No .
402 for recording daily gauge standardization and for recording the results of all nuclear gauge moisture and density test results .
At locations directed by the Representative , conduct acceptance testing for moisture and density at the frequencies specified in Table B .
If the required density of the compacted material is not obtained , promptly rework , reshape , and recompact or remove and replace damaged or unsatisfactory areas and perform an acceptance retests before placement or testing of another area .
The extent of the unsatisfactory area is defined by the Representative using one of the following : visual inspection of the site , behavior of the material under the compaction equipment originally used to compact the material , delineation using the acceptance moisture-density gauge , or any combination of the above methods .
When an acceptance retest fails to meet the specified requirements , check standard count of the acceptance test gauge on the reference standard block in accordance with PTM No .
418 or AASHTO T310 , as appropriate .
If the standard count does not meet requirements established for the gauge from the last annual calibration , or is inconsistent with the daily gauge standardization count , the gauge must be diagnosed and repaired or replaced , as necessary , before work may proceed .
If the acceptance test gauge is determined to be functioning properly , and if the required density of the compacted material , within the specified moisture limits , can not be obtained , conduct a new moisture-density test on the material , in accordance with PTM No .
106 , to determine if the moisture-density relationship of the material has changed .
If the moisture-density relationship of the material has changed , the corresponding new target values for moisture and density must be established and used for QC acceptance and verification testing .
If moisture-density testing indicates that the original target moisture and density are valid , the Contractor must review their operations , make adjustments within specification requirements , and amend the QC Plan to obtain acceptable results .
Table B Acceptance Test Frequency Material Embankment or Fill Subgrade * Pipe Backfill Frequency One acceptance test per lift for each 4,000 square yards placed ; minimum one test per lift per day .

Blasting required for rock cut slopes must be conducted in a safe manner to the line and grade shown on the Contract Drawings .
( a ) Controlled Blasting .
Blasting that uses explosives and proper blasting equipment placed in carefully spaced and aligned blastholes to produce a uniform surface in the rock along a specified excavation backslope .
Controlled blasting methods include : 1 .
Presplit Blasting .
A controlled blasting method in which the row of blastholes are drilled along the plane of the specified final excavation backslope .
Presplitting uses reduced blasthole spacing , diameter , and explosive charges .
The initiation of blasting in the presplit blastholes precedes the initiation of the adjacent production blasthole explosives by a delay .
The delay decouples the final excavated rock face from the excavation and prevents energy from production blasts from propagating to , and damaging , the final cut face .
2 .
Trim Blasting .
A controlled blasting method that cleanly shears a rock face when there is insufficient burden for production blasting .
It is essentially identical to presplit blasting , but without production blast holes .
( b ) Production Blasting .
Rock fragmentation blasting that typically has more widely spaced blastholes than controlled blastholes .
Production blastholes are drilled in a pattern throughout the main excavation area adjacent to the controlled blast row .
Production blastholes are detonated in a controlled delay sequence toward an open face or relief produced by blastholes firing on an earlier delay .
Production blasting fragments the rock in the area to be excavated , to the size required for removal and placement .

For 30-inch and 36-inch presplit patterns , hole to hole spacing must be within 6-inches of the intended spacing .
Hole to hole spacing must be maintained throughout presplitting .
If the deviation of presplit blastholes exceeds the allowable tolerance , provide the Department alternative drilling methods in a revised Blasting Plan to reduce deviation within the above specified tolerances .
Alternative drilling methods may include , but are not limited to , revised procedures , drill tooling , cutting bits , or other equipment that provides specified spacing tolerances .
Obtain Department acceptance of the revised Blasting Plan before proceeding .
Test sections must not exceed 110 feet .
• The test section must demonstrate the suitability of the proposed blast plan relative to fragmentation requirements , overbreak control , flyrock control , adequacy of stemming , and other appropriate or necessary factors .
• When results of the drill logs are unusual ( i.e. , encountering zones of soft or weathered rock , mud or clay pockets , voids ; rate of penetration ; and the color and character of drill cuttings ) , revise the Blasting Plan as necessary and obtain Department acceptance of the revised Blasting Plan before proceeding .
• When rock of different characteristics is encountered , a blasting test section must be performed .
• Excavate the blasted test section to fully expose the presplit face and provide the means to access the face so that the Department can examine and evaluate the results of the blasted test sections .
The Department will examine the completed test section and select the blasthole spacing that demonstrates the best presplit face quality .
If no acceptable conditions are found by the Department upon examination of the test section , revise and submit to the Department a new Blasting Plan for review and acceptance .
Drilling and blasting will be suspended until the Blasting Plan is accepted .
At no additional cost to the Department , conduct additional test sections at the same blasthole diameter and spacing used for the previous test section and by adjusting the explosive load until desired/acceptable results are obtained without exceeding the established PPV as specified in Section 207.3 ( j ) .
Unsatisfactory results include , but are not limited to , excessive fragmentation beyond the indicated lines and grade , excessive flyrock , and poor timing delays .
Upon completion of test blasting , obtain written approval from the Department to proceed with full scale blasting operations .
• If the Contractor has conducted repeated test blasts using different drilling techniques , reduced the height of the lift in an attempt to meet the borehole deviation limits , provided evidence that the magnitude and direction of deviation between each blasthole has remained constant , and ultimately determined that due to geologic conditions deviation tolerances are not achievable , the Department may review the findings and make an informed decision of any acceptable boredhole deviations .

This work also includes any necessary corrective actions required as a result of the evaluation .
405.3 CONSTRUCTION— ( a ) General Requirements .
Longitudinal joint density lots will be established as specified in Section 405.3 ( b ) .
These incentive/disincentive lots are completely independent from lots defined in other sections of these Specifications for pavement acceptance .
The Representative will determine the payment addition or deduction along with any necessary corrective actions for each longitudinal joint lot based on the test results of the density cores .
( b ) Lot Size .
A full lot is 12,500 feet of longitudinal joint and will consist of 5 sublots of 2,500 feet .
The Representative will designate lots as the longitudinal joints on the project are constructed , beginning on the first day wearing course paving abuts a previously placed wearing course , forming a longitudinal joint .
Joints constructed with tandem pavers will be included , unless otherwise indicated .
As paving progresses and longitudinal joints are constructed , drill one core per sublot until a full lot is obtained according to Section 405.3 ( e ) .
Do not include the length of excluded joints in the 12,500 feet lot .
A single lot need not be contiguous and may include multiple joints throughout the project limits .
Partial lots with less than three sublots will be combined with the previous lot .
Partial lots with three or more sublots will stand as a separate lot .
( c ) Quality Control Strip .
On the first day paving abuts a previously placed mat , forming a longitudinal joint eligible for evaluation , determine the effectiveness of the material placement and compaction operations as well as the mixture design on longitudinal joint density .
In addition to any incentive/disincentive payment sublot cores , obtain five 6-inch diameter core samples located randomly on the longitudinal joint for QC density testing .
Test the cores according to PTM No .
715 or PTM No .
716 and provide the results of the tests to the Representative within 24 hours .
The Contractor may elect to make adjustments to the mixture design or placement and compaction operations to ensure adequate in place density is being achieved .
If proposing changes that impact the field quality control plan or job mix formula , submit any modifications or revisions to the Department for review .
( d ) Excluded Areas .
The following joint areas are to be excluded from the longitudinal joint lots .
The Representative will not obtain samples from excluded areas to determine lot incentive/disincentive payment .

1.b Spreading and Finishing .
Spread and strike off the mixture for the entire lane width or as much lane width as practical .
Adjust screed assemblies to provide the required cross section and depth .
After spreading , do not add mixture to the pavement mat that is segregated , below the minimum temperature , contains either a deficiency or an excess of asphalt content , or is otherwise unsuitable to add to the pavement mat .
If the course is more than 6 inches in compacted depth , construct it in two or more layers of approximately equal depth , with no layer less than 3 inches or more than 6 inches in compacted depth .
For binder or leveling courses that have isolated areas exceeding 6-inch compacted depth , use a scratch or leveling course to eliminate the isolated areas before full-depth paving .
Immediately after placing the bituminous mixture , work the exposed outer edges to eliminate sharp , ragged , and open edges , to eliminate an unfinished appearance , and to reduce edge breakdown .
Immediately repair edge breakdowns .
In areas where mechanical spreaders can not be used , place and screed the mixture with suitable hand tools .

( k ) Joints .
1 .
Longitudinal Joints .
1.a General .
Offset joints in a layer from the joint in the layer immediately below by approximately 6 inches .
409.3 ( k ) 409.3 ( k ) 409 – 16 Change No .
3 Plan joint locations to ensure that the joint in the top layer is at the approximate pavement centerline for two-lane roadways and within 12 inches of the lane lines for roadways with more than two lanes .
Avoid joint locations directly beneath planned pavement marking applications where possible .
Before placing abutting lanes , paint the entire area of the joint with a uniform coating of bituminous material , the PG-Binder used in the pavement course or PG 64-22 .
Painting of the joint face is not required for scratch courses .
Place and compact the mixture at the joint according to the Paving Operation QC Plan .
Ensure the surface across the joint and along the joint is within the surface tolerances specified in Section 409.3 ( l ) .
Adhere to the following additional requirements for the construction of longitudinal joints that will not be evaluated as specified in Section 405 : Assure a true line when paving .
Place and closely follow lines or markings for this purpose .
When compacting loose mixture at an unsupported edge , make the first roller pass with the edge of the roller drum extending beyond and overhanging the unsupported edge by 3 to 6 inches .
Do not allow pneumatic-tire rollers to cause lateral movement at any unsupported edge .
When placing uncompacted mixture adjacent to a previously compacted lane , operate the paver so that the material overlaps the edge of the previously placed lane by 1 to 1 1/2 inches .
Ensure that mixture behind the screed is tightly pushed against the free face of the existing lane .
Maintain the uncompacted mixture uniformly higher than the existing lane by at least 1/4 inch per inch of material being placed to assure full compaction .
When possible , use automated joint matchers when constructing joints between traveled lanes .
Do not bump back or lute the overlapped material unless overlap inadvertently exceeds the specified tolerances .
When compacting the loose mix at the longitudinal joint , keep the roller drum approximately 6 to 12 inches from the joint for the first pass forward .
On the backward and subsequent passes , overlap the joint 2 to 6 inches .
Ensure that the joint receives at least as many roller passes as the rest of the mat .
If traffic or other cause distorts the lane edge , restore the lane edge to its original shape , using acceptable procedures .
1.b Vertical Joints .
• The Contractor may use vertical joints for base , binder , and wearing courses .
• If traffic or other cause distorts the lane edge , carefully saw a vertical lane edge before painting .
• Place the abutting lane on the same day , and if necessary , leave only short lane sections , normally less than 25 feet in length , where the abutting lane is not placed the same day .
1.c Notched Wedge Joints .
• The Contractor may use notched wedge joints for wearing and binder courses with NMAS mixtures of 19.0 mm or smaller .
• Remove and dispose of all loose and foreign material before opening the lane to traffic .
• Construct the joint according to Standard Drawing RC-28M .
• If the joint is next to opposing traffic , place the abutting lane within 1 working day after placing the mixture .
If the joint is next to traffic in the same direction , place the abutting lane within 2 working days after placing the mixture .
• If both lanes that make the joint are not placed on the same day , amend the Maintenance and Protection of Traffic Plan and install additional signing for uneven lane at no additional cost to the Department .
Install `` Uneven Lane '' signs according to Publication 212 , Publication 213 , and MUTCD and 1/2-mile before the notched wedge joint area and every 1/2-mile within the uneven pavement area .
2 .
Transverse Joints .
Construct joints perpendicular to the pavement centerline .
The Contractor may saw transverse joints .
If used , install bulkheads straight and perpendicular to the surface .
If a bulkhead is not used and the roller moves over the rounded edge of new mixture , locate the joint a sufficient distance from the rounded edge to 409.3 ( k ) 409.4 ( a ) 409 – 17 Change No .
3 provide a true surface and cross section .
Paint the joint face with a thin coating of bituminous material , the PG-Binder used in the pavement course or PG 64-22 , before placing fresh mixture against the joint face .
Painting of the joint face is not required for scratch courses .
3 .
Other Joints .
Where placing a wearing course abutting to existing pavement at locations such as paving notches , lane additions , or utility openings , seal the joint with hot bituminous material of the class and type designated for the wearing course .
Evenly apply the sealant a minimum of 6 inches on both sides of the joint .
The Contractor may use a Class AET , Class E-6 ( AASHTO SS-1 or CSS-1 ) or E-8 ( AASHTO SS-1h or CSS-1h ) emulsified asphalt instead of hot bituminous material .
Before sealing , clean and remove harmful material from the area to be sealed .
Control the application rate so residual asphalt completely fills surface voids and provides a watertight joint .
If necessary , use two or more applications of emulsified asphalt .
Remove excess bituminous material and immediately cover the sealed area with a light application of dry sand that is acceptable to the Representative .
( l ) Surface Tolerance .
Test the finished surface with a 10-foot straightedge at areas the Representative determines may be deficient or irregular , and at transverse joints and paving notches .
Hold the straightedge in contact with the surface and in successive positions parallel to the road centerline to check the entire width of the pavement .
Advance along the pavement in stages of not more than one-half the length of the straightedge until the entire area is tested .
The pavement is defective if irregularities are more than 3/16 inch .
( m ) Tests for Depth : Binder and Wearing Courses .
Construct the pavement to the depth indicated and within the specified tolerances .
For courses with density acceptance by lots , the Inspector will measure the depth of each sublot according to PTM No .
737 using the density acceptance samples .
For courses with a designed course depth and density acceptance by non-movement or optimum rolling pattern , the Inspector will calculate the mass per square meter ( weight per square yard ) for verification of yield .
If yield results indicate insufficient course depth , drill one 6 inch diameter core for each 500 tons of material placed to determine the extent of the deficient depth .
Core locations will be determined using PTM No .
1 .
For courses with density acceptance by lots , the inspector will measure the depth of each sublot according to PTM No .
737 using density acceptance samples .
Pavement deficient in depth by more than 1/4 inch is defective work .
Pavement deficient in depth by more than 1/8 inch in three or more adjacent core locations is defective work .
The extent of the defective work is the entirety of all sublots represented by the adjacent deficient core samples .
After the Inspector completes depth measurements , backfill , compact , and seal core holes with the mixture used to construct the course .
Immediately start correcting courses or pavement that are deficient in depth at the core location and proceed longitudinally and transversely until the depth is within 1/4 inch of the design depth .
( n ) Protection of Courses .
Do not allow vehicular traffic or loads on newly compacted courses for 24 hours or until the course uniformly cools to a temperature of 140 F or less .
Provide alternate routes as indicated or as directed .
If both lanes that form a longitudinal joint are placed on the same day and public safety is not restricted , do not allow vehicular traffic or loads on the lanes until adequate stability and adhesion is obtained and the material has uniformly cooled to 140 F or less .
Maintain the course , as specified in Sections 105.13 , 107.15 , and 901 .
( o ) Defective Work .

The LTS Gmm value ( s ) determined will be the Gmm values used to determine the percent of theoretical maximum density for the cores represented by the applicable production or placement dates in the lot .
Either the previously verified Contractor ’ s Gmm value ( s ) or the newly tested LTS Gmm value ( s ) will be used for acceptance to determine the percent theoretical maximum density for each sublot core in the lot .
Upon completing the retesting of the original density acceptance cores , the LTS will evaluate testing repeatability for the bulk density results of PTM No .
715 and PTM No .
716 , if necessary , using both the original bulk density test values and the bulk density retest values according to PTM No .

o The Inspector will document the placement location ( s ) by station of material placed to clearly delineate the location of all material within the lot .
• The Department will continue project lot acceptance testing until five consecutive lots are accepted at ≥ 90PWL .
Once five consecutive lots are accepted at ≥ 90 PWL , acceptance may again be by producer certification and verification testing will begin again at the frequency in Table F for the remaining project quantity .
The Contractor will be charged $ 600 for each lot of material placed , for the project lot acceptance testing performed by the Inspector .
• For all test values , the Department will determine the lot PWL according to Section 106.03 ( a ) 3 .
If results indicate a PWL ≥ 90 , the lot is accepted at full payment .
If results indicate a PWL < 90 for the material , the Department will determine the Degree of Non-Conformance ( DNC ) for the lot according to the following : o Lot average values for any sieve size which do not conform to the specified limits will be used to calculate the DNC .
For each sieve where the average does not conform to specifications , the difference between the average test value and the closest specified limit will be computed ( upper limit for average values where the upper limit has been exceeded or lower limit for average values where the lower limit was not reached ) .
Each difference will be multiplied by the factor shown in Table G. o Crushed fragment average test results which do not conform to the specified limits will also be included in the DNC .
The DNC will include the difference between the lower specified limit and the lot average crushed fragment test results .
o The Department will determine the total DNC for the lot by summing of all the non- conformances for each sieve size and crushed fragments after each has been multiplied by applicable factors in Table G and Table H. The total DNC will be used to adjust the payment represented by the non-conforming lot as shown in Table I .

The Structure Control Engineer will verify the capability of the hammer to properly drive the piles from driving records of test piles at each substructure unit , at locations indicated or directed .
If information from indicated soundings , dug test pits , and auger or test borings is used to analyze subsurface conditions , refer to Section 102.05 for conditions pertaining to use of this information .
Use a hammer of a type and size that enables piles to be driven to any driving resistance without pile damage due to driving stresses .
An estimate of the point of impending damage , due to driving stresses , in piles will be made from a wave equation analysis for the hammer , drive head size , type of capblock , cushion material , and length of pile in the leads to be used , or by observations during the test-pile driving operation .
The point of impending damage in steel piles or shells is defined as a driving stress of 100 % of the yield point of the pile material , as estimated from a wave-equation analysis , or a lesser value if the strength of the pile or shell is governed by the strength of the splice .
The Structure Control Engineer will reject hammers that cause damage in steel piles at any driving resistance .
Acceptance of a hammer relative to driving stress damage will not relieve the Contractor ’ s responsibility for piles damaged because of misalignment of the leads , failure of capblock or cushion material , failure of splices , malfunctioning of the hammer , or other improper construction methods .
The Structure Control Engineer will reject piles damaged for these reasons , if it is determined that the damage impairs the strength of the completed pile installation .
At least 21 calendar days before driving test piles , submit the hammer ’ s operating specifications and pile information for review and acceptance on the Pile Hammer Data form , CS-5 .

As an alternative to periodic measurements with a needle gage , develop a pressure versus speed calibration for the driving conditions at the site .
If a hammer is used for timber piles for which the Maximum Permissible Driving Resistance ( MPDR ) is less than 20 blows per 1 inch , do not drive piles beyond MPDR if piles do not reach bedrock .
Although point bearing is discouraged , if piles are required to reach bedrock or into very dense stratum for capacity , do not use a hammer with MPDR less than 20 blows per 1 inch .
Size the hammer so that MPDR is approximately 20 blows per 1 inch .

Drive piles plumb or to the batter indicated .
Drive piles to absolute refusal for point and end bearing piles and end of driving criteria for friction piles , or to the predetermined pile tip elevation and to the driving resistance established from test piles or pile load tests .
Unless otherwise indicated , the predetermined pile tip elevation is considered approximate in order to allow for variations in the locations or strength of the stratum from which the pile obtains its primary capacity .
The limit of the approximation is established from pile load tests or test piles .

4 .
Absolute Refusal and End of Driving Criteria .
4.a Absolute Refusal .
For steel point bearing and end bearing piles , absolute refusal is reached when the driving resistance attains an average of 20 blows per 1 inch , or more .
The total number of blows required to calculate the average driving resistance specified for absolute refusal is determined from test pile driving results .
Minimum blow requirements are as follows : Case 1 .
Piles Required to Be Driven to Absolute Refusal into Sound , Well Defined Bedrock 1005.3 ( b ) 1005.3 ( b ) 1005-6 Initial Edition ( Point Bearing Piles ) .
After the pile tip reaches the predetermined elevation of the intended bearing stratum , and after penetration becomes 1/4 inch or less for five consecutive blows , absolute refusal is reached if the penetration for five additional blows is less than 1/4 inch .
Case 2 .
Piles Required to Be Driven to Absolute Refusal into Soft or Decomposed Bedrock , or Dense or Hard Soil Strata ( End-Bearing Piles ) .
After the pile tip reaches the predetermined elevation of the intended bearing stratum , and after the penetration becomes 1/2 inch or less for ten consecutive blows , absolute refusal is reached if the penetration for ten additional blows is 1/2 inch or less .
After the pile tip enters the intended bearing stratum , if an unreasonably large number of blows is required to increase the driving resistance from 10 blows per 1 inch to 20 blows per 1 inch , the Structure Control Engineer may waive the requirement for driving to absolute refusal .
Case 3 .
Piles Which Attain Absolute Refusal Above Predetermined Pile Tip Elevations .
If hard driving is encountered because of dense strata or because of obstructions located above the bearing stratum identified by a predetermined pile tip elevation , absolute refusal is not reached until the Structure Control Engineer determines that the total number of blows , as the average driving resistance specified for absolute refusal , indicates that further driving will not advance the pile through the dense strata or obstructions .
The Structure Control Engineer will determine the acceptability of bearing piles that do not achieve absolute refusal and capacity at the predetermined pile tip elevation for piles intended to bear in soft or decomposed bedrock .
If bearing piles are determined unacceptable , continue driving piles to ensure absolute refusal is obtained in accordance with Case 2 Absolute Refusal .
The Structure Control Engineer will contact the BDTD if the continued driving exceeds the criteria provided in the Pile Hammer Approval Letter .
The Structure Control Engineer will determine the acceptability of bearing piles that attain absolute refusal above the predetermined pile tip elevation .
If bearing piles are determined unacceptable , drive additional piles at locations directed .
If the additional piles also fail to reach the predetermined pile tip elevation , and if directed , drive additional test piles to determine whether the predetermined pile tip elevation may have to be adjusted .
Perform test borings and pile load tests , if directed .
If the predetermined pile tip elevation can not be adjusted , and if directed , change the type and size of pile .
Perform augering , predrilling , spudding , pre-excavation , or jetting , if directed .
If bearing piles attain absolute refusal above the predetermined pile tip elevation due to freezing resulting from discontinuous driving , the Structure Control Engineer will reject the piles .
4.b End of Driving Criteria .
For steel friction piles , end of driving criteria is reached when the required resistance is attained and the pile tip reaches the predetermined elevation of the intended bearing stratum .
Determine the required resistance based on the plan factored axial resistance and confirm pile capacity by dynamic load testing .
A pile driving analyzer is to be used to confirm that the end of driving criteria , ( i.e .
hammer stroke , required resistance , pile tip elevation , pile stress and blow count ) have been attained .
If friction piles reach the required resistance above the predetermined pile tip elevation due to freezing resulting from discontinuous driving , the Structure Control Engineer will reject the piles .
If friction test piles do not reach the required resistance at the predetermined pile tip elevation ( or after redrive , if redrive is specified ) , splice a 10-foot extension and continue driving until the required resistance is attained .
The Structure Control Engineer will set the revised pile tip elevation ( s ) based on the test pile results .
If the required resistance is still not attained after the additional 10 feet of driving depth , the Structure Control Engineer is to contact BDTD to review geotechnical information and recommend further actions .

If relubrication is required , use a lubricant recommended by the fastener manufacturer .
Provide a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator , or other equivalent bolt tension measuring device , at each job site , during erection .
Perform periodic testing ( at least once each working day if calibrated wrench method is used ) to ensure compliance with the installation test procedures specified herein for turn-of-nut tightening , calibrated wrench tightening , installation of alternate design bolts , and direct tension indicator tightening .
Bolts that are too short for the Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator may be tested using DTI devices .
In that case , calibrate the DTI devices in the Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator using longer bolts .
Install fasteners together with washers of size and quality specified , located as required below , in properly aligned holes , and tighten by any of the methods specified in Sections 1050.3 ( c ) 7.d through 1050.3 ( c ) 7.g to at least the minimum tension specified in Table A , when all the fasteners are tight .
When it is impractical to turn the nut , tighten the fastener by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating .
If impact wrenches are used , provide adequate wrench capacity and sufficient air supply to perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately 10 seconds .
Do not reuse galvanized ASTM A325 fasteners .
Reuse other ASTM A325 bolts only if approved .
Do not consider as reuse touching up or retightening previously tightened bolts that may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts provided the snugging up continues from the initial position and does not require greater rotation , including the tolerance , than that required by Table B .
7.b Rotational-Capacity Tests .
Perform the rotational capacity test on each bolt/nut/washer assembly lot , as specified in Section 1105.02 ( d ) 7 , immediately before the start of bolt installation in the fabrication shop or at the project site .
Document test results according to PTM No .
427 .
If testing and installation is performed in the fabrication shop , submit test results to LTS .
If testing and installation is performed at the project site , submit test results to the Representative .
All job-site rotational capacity tests are to be performed by the Contractor and witnessed by the Inspector .
Hardened steel washers are required as part of the test , although they may not be required in the actual installation .
Mark fastener containers for each assembly lot after testing to indicate their acceptance .
7.c Requirement for Washers .
Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 20:1 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis , use a hardened beveled washer to compensate for the lack of parallelism .
For American Standard Beams and Channels use hardened beveled washers that are square or rectangular , that conform to ASTM F436M , and that taper in thickness .
Where necessary , clip washers on one side to a point not closer than 7/8 of the bolt diameter from the center of the washer .
Hardened washers are not required for connections using ASTM A325 bolts except as follows : • Use hardened washers under the element turned in tightening when the tightening is to be performed by calibrated wrench method .
• Hardened steel washers are required as part of rotational-capacity tests , even if they are not required in the actual installation .
• Where ASTM A325 bolts are to be installed in a long slotted hole in an outer ply , provide a plate washer or continuous bar of at least 5/16-inch thickness with standard holes .
Furnish washers or bars of sufficient size to completely cover the slot after installation .
Use a single hardened washer conforming to ASTM F436 , but with a minimum thickness of 5/16 inch , or use a washer or bar of structural grade material .
Do not use multiple hardened washers to achieve a thickness of 5/16 inch .
• As an alternate satisfying the requirements for washers , use alternate design fasteners conforming to the requirements specified in Section 1050.3 ( c ) 7.c.1 , with a geometry that provides a bearing circle on the head or nut with a diameter equal to or greater than the diameter of hardened washers conforming to the requirements of ASTM F436 .
Such fasteners may be used without washers .
1050.3 ( c ) 1050.3 ( c ) 1050 – 8 Change No .
2 7.c.1 Alternate Fasteners .
If alternate fasteners are allowed , proceed as specified in Section 1050.3 ( c ) 7.h and as follows : If allowed , use other fasteners or fastener assemblies that conform to the materials , manufacturing , and chemical composition requirements of ASTM A325 and that conform to the mechanical property requirements of the same specification in full-size tests , and that have body diameter and bearing areas under the head and nut , or their equivalent , not less than those provided by a bolt and nut of the same nominal dimensions specified in Section 1105.02 ( d ) .
Such alternate fasteners may differ in other dimensions from those of the specified bolts and nuts .
7.d Turn-of-Nut Tightening .
If turn-of-nut tightening is used , hardened washers are not required except as specified in Section 1050.3 ( c ) 7.c .
Check a representative sample of not less than three bolt and nut assemblies of each diameter , length and grade to be used in the work at the start of work in a device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Using the test , demonstrate that the method for estimating the snug tight condition and controlling the turns from snug tight to be used by the bolting crew develops a tension not less than 5 % greater than the tension required by Table A .
Perform periodic retesting if ordered by the Representative .
Install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition .
Snug tight is defined as the tightness that exists when the plies of the joint are in firm contact .
Use a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench to attain the snug tight condition .
Snug tighten the bolts of the connection by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges , and then retighten the bolts in a similar systematic manner as necessary until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted .
Following this initial operation further tighten all bolts in the connection by the applicable amount of rotation specified in Table B .
During the tightening operation , do not allow rotation of the part not turned by the wrench .
Systematically tighten the bolts progressing from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
7.e Calibrated-Wrench Tightening .
Use calibrated wrench tightening only if installation procedures are calibrated on a daily basis and if a hardened washer is used under the element turned in tightening .
Standard torques determined from tables or from formulas , which are assumed to relate torque to tension , are not acceptable .
When calibrated wrenches are used for installation , set them to provide a tension not less than 5 % in excess of the minimum tension specified in Table A. Calibrate the installation procedures at least once each working day for each bolt diameter , length , and grade , using fastener assemblies that are being installed in the work .
Perform calibration in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension by tightening three typical bolts of each diameter , length , and grade , from the bolts being installed and with a hardened washer , from the washers being used in the work , under the element turned in tightening .
Recalibrate wrenches if significant difference is noted in the surface condition of the bolts , threads , nuts , and washers .
Verify during actual installation in the assembled steel work that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from snug tight greater than that specified in Table B .
If manual torque wrenches are used , turn nuts in the tightening direction when torque is measured .
When calibrated wrenches are used to install and tension bolts in a connection , install bolts with hardened washers under the element turned in tightening bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to a snug tight condition .
Following this initial tightening operation , tighten the connection using the calibrated wrench .
Tighten the bolts by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
Use the wrench to again tighten previously tightened bolts that may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tightening of adjacent bolts , until all bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount .
7.f Installation of Alternate Design Bolts .
When fasteners that incorporate a design feature intended to indirectly indicate the bolt tension or to automatically provide the tension specified in Table A and that have been qualified under Section 1050.3 ( c ) 7.c.1 are to be installed , check a representative sample of not less than three bolts of each diameter , length , and grade , at the job site in a device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Include flat , hardened washers in the test assembly , if required in the actual connection , arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned .
Use the calibration test to demonstrate that each bolt develops a tension not less than 5 % greater than the tension specified in Table A .
Follow the manufacturer 's installation procedure for installation of bolts in the calibration device and in all connections .
Perform periodic retesting when ordered by the Representative .
When alternate design fasteners that are intended to control or indicate bolt tension of the fasteners are used , install bolts in all holes of the connection and initially tighten them sufficiently to bring all plies of the joint into firm contact but without yielding or fracturing the control or indicator element of the fasteners .
Then further tighten all fasteners , progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened fasteners .
In some cases , to properly tension the bolts , perform more than 1050.3 ( c ) 1050.3 ( c ) 1050 – 9 Change No .
2 a single cycle of systematic partial tightening before final twist-off of the control or indicator element of individual fasteners .
Replace any individual fastener assembly if twist off occurs before the final tensioning cycle .
7.g Direct Tension Indicator Tightening .
When tightening of bolts using DTI devices is used , assemble a representative sample of not less than three devices , for each diameter and grade of fastener to be used in the work , in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension .
Include flat-hardened washers in the test assembly , if required in the actual connection , arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned .
Use the calibration test to demonstrate that the device indicates a tension not less than 5 % greater than that specified in Table A .
After tightening in the calibrating device , use a torque wrench to verify the torque required for proper tightening .
Tighten the nut of each assembly five degrees past the initial required tension , record the respective load reading on the torque wrench dial , and determine the average of the sample assemblies .
This average torque will be the inspection torque used on completed connections and is to be determined each day that inspection of completed connections is performed .
Follow manufacturer 's installation procedure for installation of bolts in the calibration device and in all connections .
Give special attention to proper installation of flat-hardened washers when DTI devices are used with bolts installed in oversize or slotted holes and when the load indicating devices are used under the turned element .
When bolts are installed using DTIs conforming to the requirements of ASTM F959 , install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to snug tight conditions .
Snug tight is indicated by partial compression of the direct tension indicator protrusions .
Provide a maximum gap of 0.005 inch after installation .
Then tighten all fasteners , progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges , in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened fasteners .

1050.3 ( c ) 1050.4 1050 – 10 Change No .
2 ( 2 ) Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel .
( 3 ) No research work has been performed by the Research Council Riveted and Bolted Structural Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure if bolt lengths exceed 12 diameters .
Therefore , the required rotation must be determined by actual tests , in a suitable tension device , simulating the actual conditions .
In some cases , proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than a single cycle of systematic partial tightening before final tightening to deform the protrusion to the specified gap .
7.h Lock-Pin and Collar Fasteners .
Install lock-pin and collar fasteners using approved methods and procedures .
7.i Inspection .
In the presence of the Inspector , inspect the tightened bolts using a calibrated torque wrench .
At the Representative 's option , this inspection can be performed either by the Inspector or the Contractor .
Individually place three bolts of the same grade , size , and condition as those under inspection in a device calibrated to measure bolt tension .
Perform this calibration operation at least once each inspection day .
Provide a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt , if washers are used on the structure .
If washers are not used on the structure , furnish the material used in the tension measuring device which abuts the part turned of the same specification as that used on the structure .
In the calibrated device , tighten each bolt to the specified tension by any convenient means .
Apply the calibrated torque wrench to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head five degrees ( approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius ) in the tightening direction .
Take the average of the torque required for all three bolts as the job-inspection torque .
For final acceptance of connections installed using high-strength bolts , inspect 10 % ( 2 minimum ) of the bolts in the connection using a calibrated torque wrench .
Select bolts to be inspected according to PTM No .
1 .
Then apply the job-inspection torque to each with the calibrated torque wrench turned in the tightening direction .
If this torque turns no bolt head or nut , the bolts in the connection will be considered to be properly tightened .
But if the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts , apply the job-inspection torque to all bolts in the connection .
Tighten and reinspect any bolt whose head or nut turns at this stage , or retighten all the bolts in the connection and resubmit it for inspection .
8 .
Pin Connections .
Use pilot and driving nuts in driving pins .
Drive pins so that the members will take full bearing on them .
Screw pin nuts up tight and burr the threads at the face of the nut with a pointed tool .

Misfits .
The correction of minor misfits involving minor amounts of reaming , cutting , and chipping will be considered a legitimate part of the erection .
However , errors in the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and transporting will be cause for rejection .
The Contractor is responsible for all misfits , errors , and damage .
Make the necessary corrections and replacements to correct misfits , errors , and damage .
( d ) Painting .
Apply intermediate and finish coats of paint , as specified in Section 1060.3 .

Use the spacing and temperature necessary to obtain the required curvature and to allow heating to progress along the top and bottom at approximately the same rate .
Terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the inside flange surface just before the junction of the web and the flange is reached .
When heating the inside flange surface ( the surfaces that intersect the web ) , do not apply heat directly to the web .
If the radius of curvature is 1,000 feet or more , extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web .
If the radius of curvature is less than 1,000 feet , extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to one-eighth of the flange or 3 inches , whichever is less .
For the truncated triangular pattern , provide an included angle of approximately 15 to 30 degrees , but do not exceed 10 inches for the base of the triangle .
Do not make variations in the patterns prescribed above unless permitted .
For both types of heating , heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling .

5 .
Position for Heating .
Heat-curve the girder with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position .
If curved in the vertical position , brace or support the girder in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heat-curving process will not cause the girder to overturn .
If curved in the horizontal position , support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points , as necessary , to obtain a uniform curvature .
Do not allow the bending stress in the flanges due to the dead weight of the girder to exceed the usual allowable design stress .
Maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the mid-length of the girder within 2 inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due to plastic flange buckling .

1108.03 CONSTRUCTION— ( a ) Post-Tensioning Systems .
Include anchorages , fittings , sheathing , tendons , and grout .
( b ) Corrosion Protection .
Protect prestressing steel against physical damage , rust , and corrosion .
Do not use prestressing steel that has sustained physical damage , pitting , or that has rust that can not be removed by wiping with a dry cloth .
Do not retain prestressing steel in an ungrouted duct for more than 10 days without special acceptable corrosion protection .
Pack prestressing steel in containers or other shipping forms for protection against physical damage and corrosion during shipping and storage .
Place a corrosion inhibitor that prevents rust or other corrosion in the package or form or , when allowed , apply it directly to the steel or to the tendon .
Mark on the shipping package or form that the package contains high-strength , prestressing steel and the care to be used in handling .
State the type , kind , and amount of corrosion inhibitor used , including placement date , safety orders , and instructions for use .
When stressing and grouting are completed within 10 calendar days after the prestressing steel installation , rust that may form will not be cause for rejection .
In this case , use of a corrosion inhibitor is not necessary .
Before use submit the coating system for tendon corrosion protection in a bonded system for approval .
Protect bar tendons from corrosion at the job site by spraying with a rust preventative and by use of an approved protective covering over the bars .
( c ) Anchorages and Bearing Devices .
Use permanent-type anchorages to secure prestressing steel at the ends .
Steel distribution plates or assemblies may be omitted if large enough anchorages are used in conjunction with a steel grill embedded in the concrete to effectively distribute the compressive stresses to the concrete .
For all systems of post-tensioning , set each anchorage device in all directions perpendicular to the prestressing steel axis .
At both tendon ends , make accurate measurements of anchorage loss , due to slippage or other causes .
Compare these losses with the assumed losses shown in the post-tensioning schedule on the shop drawings .
When necessary , make adjustments or corrections in the operation .
For special anchorage devices , test according to AASHTO Standard Specification Division II , Section 10.3.2.3 .
( d ) Installation of Sheathing Ducts .
Form and place sheathing and secure it to prevent movement when concrete is placed .
Make splices grout-tight .
After installation , blow the ducts clear using oil-free compressed air , for at least 5 seconds each .
Plug the duct ends to prevent the entry of water or debris .
Furnish sheathing ducts with interlocked seams .
Make joints with positive metallic connections , which do not result in angle changes at the joints .
Use waterproof tape at the connections to seal seams .
Provide ducts or anchorage assemblies with pipes or connections for grout injection .
Install pipe vents that are 1/2 inch or larger in size near the high points of each duct .
Use metallic structural fasteners to make connections to ducts .
1108.03 ( d ) 1108.03 ( f ) 1108 – 4 Change No .
1 Make vents grout-tight , tape as necessary , and provide means for grout injection .
Remove vent ends 1 inch below the member surface , after grouting has been completed .
For tendons made up of single prestressing bar or strand , make the inside diameter at least 1/4 inch greater than the diameter of the prestressing bar or strand .
For tendons made up of a number of prestressing bars or strands , make the duct 's cross-sectional area at least twice the net area of prestressing steel .
Locate ducts within the specified tolerances .
For curved members , place the ducts on , or symmetrically about , the member axis parallel to the curvature direction .
Provide concrete cover a minimum of 1 1/2 inches for sheathing up to 2 inches O.D. , and a minimum of 2 inches of cover for larger sheathing .
Provide a minimum of 1 1/2-inch clear spacing between the sheathing at the beam ends , or provide 1 1/2 times the maximum aggregate size , whichever is greater .
After the prestressing steel has been installed , do not weld or ground for welding equipment on steel in the member .
Do not flame cut , unless the ducts and tendons are effectively shielded .
( e ) Prestressing .
Tension prestressing steel , using hydraulic jacks , so the force in the prestressing steel is not less than the value indicated or on the accepted shop drawings with appropriate allowance for all losses .
Within 20 days before stressing , calibrate all jacks and pressure gauge system and furnish certified copies of the load calibration curves to the Engineer except jack calibration for post tensioning of box culverts and adjacent box beams .
For post tensioning of box culverts and adjacent box beams accompany jack gages with a current , certified calibration chart , not older than 6 months .
Equip each jack with a pressure gage having an accurate reading dial at least 6 inches in diameter .
Calibrate each jack and its gage as a unit , with the cylinder extension in the approximate position it will be in at final jacking force .
Recalibrate stressing equipment at 6-month intervals and at other times when required .
Do not interchange jacks and gauges without recalibration .
Check the certified calibration chart for hydraulic jacks and pressure gages used for tensioning prestressing steel , both before and during tensioning operations .
Do not stress tendons until the concrete has attained its 28-day strength , unless partial stressing is allowed at a lower strength .
Apply to the tendon , an initial load of 10 % of the full load to take up slack and to provide a starting point for measurement of elongations .
Apply the final load , including any overload .
Apply the load at a rate consistent with procedures recommended by the manufacturer of the system .
Unless otherwise indicated , in simple span members , stress by jacking from one end only , with one-half of the prestressing steel in each member tensioned from one end and the other one-half tensioned from the opposite end .
When the same tendons are jacked from two ends , both jacking operations may be done simultaneously , provided uniform tensioning forces are applied at each end .
The stressing forces , measured by jacking pressures and elongation , are required to agree within 5 % .
If the measurements can not be reconciled within this range , halt the stressing , examine the procedure , and determine the sources of error so the measured force can be verified within this limit .
If sources of error can not be determined or verified by the Professional Engineer in charge of post-tensioning operations , to the satisfaction of the Engineer , the post-tensioning of the member will be stopped and the member rejected .
In continuous members , tension by jacking at each tendon end , unless otherwise indicated .
Jacking of both ends need not be done simultaneously , unless otherwise indicated .
( f ) Bonding and Grouting .
Start grouting promptly after tensioning .
1 .
Grout .
Use grout consisting of Portland cement , water , and admixtures .
Use Type I , II , or III Portland cement .
Use nonshrink admixture and anti-bleed admixture of the type recommended by the manufacturer of an accepted tendon .
Do not use admixtures containing chlorides or nitrates , or that release free hydrogen .
Use enough grout plastic to pump and completely fill the ducts .
No grout shrinkage is allowed while in the plastic state .
Before post-tensioning , design the mix and verify that it has a strength of 2,500 pounds per square inch at 7 days and has 4 % to 10 % expansion .
Verify strength by testing according to ASTM C 109 .
Limit the water content of the grout to the minimum volume necessary to produce a mix that can be pumped , with a maximum of 5 gallons per bag of cement .
Prepare test cylinders from each day 's grouting .
Visually determine the grout 's ability to be pumped .
Place water in the mixer , then add cement and admixture .
Strength testing of grout for precast box culverts is not required .
2 .
Grouting Equipment .
Use equipment capable of grouting at a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square inch .
Furnish equipment with a pressure gage that has a full-scale reading of not more than 300 pounds per square inch .
Provide standby flushing equipment and compressed air equipment capable of developing a pumping pressure 1108.03 ( f ) 1108.03 ( f ) 1108 – 5 Change No .
1 at 250 pounds per square inch and large enough to flush out partially grouted ducts .
Provide working pressure meters on the group pumps , meters that show the grout pressure at the injector nozzle discharge end .
3 .
Grouting .
Clear ducts of deleterious materials that would impair grout bonding or interfere with grouting procedures .
After curing , blow ducts free of water and keep them dry until grouting .
Immediately before grouting , flush the ducts with clean water , then remove excess water by blowing out with oil-free compressed air .
Mix the grout in mechanical mixing equipment that produces uniform and thoroughly mixed grout .
Do not retemper grout .
Agitate the grout continuously until it is pumped .
Before entry into the pump , screen grout through 0.07-inch maximum , clear opening screen .
Grout the ducts on the day of completion of the tensioning operation of each unit , unless otherwise directed .
Equip grout injection pipes with positive , mechanical shutoff valves .
Fit vents and ejection pipes with valves , caps , or other devices capable of withstanding the pumping pressures .
Do not remove or open valves and caps until directed , generally after the grout has set .
Apply grout by pumping toward open vents .
Pump continuously , using moderate pressure at the entry point in the duct , until entrapped air is forced out the open vent or vents and until visible slugs of water or air are ejected .
Close the outlet pipe .
With the entire duct filled and discharge vents closed , raise the pressure to a minimum of 50 pounds per square inch and hold for a minimum of 1 minute , then plug the injection point to prevent any grout loss .
Close the valve at the inlet while maintaining this pressure .
Using an abrasive , blast clean the concrete surfaces at anchorage assemblies , until clean aggregate is exposed , to ensure concrete bonding or grout encasement of assemblies .
Where the end of a post-tensioned assembly is not embedded in concrete , recess the anchorages so the prestressing steel ends and parts of the anchorages will be at least 2 inches inside of the member end surface , unless a greater embedment is indicated .
Following post-tensioning , clean the recesses , fill with nonshrinking mortar , and finish flush .
After curing , paint surfaces with two coats of epoxy resin .

Section 901.4 ( a ) Appendix A – Metric ( SI ) Information 408/2016 A - 1 Initial Edition APPENDIX A METRIC ( SI ) INFORMATION General : This Appendix provides guidance on the selection of metric ( SI ) units and how they relate to their counterparts in English or I-P units .
Topics include definitions , dual units , conversion rules , basic units of measure , commonly used SI prefixes , SI measurements , and conversion tables .
The conversion tables show multiplication values to change I-P units to SI units .
Several additional tables in this Appendix provide specific I-P / SI relationships .
These tables include :  Table A-1 .
mm2 Equivalents of American Wire Gage  Table A-2 .
NEMA Metric Non Metallic and Metallic Conduit and Fittings  Table A-3 .
Reinforcing Bar Information  Table A-4 .
Standard Test Sieves ( U.S.A. Standard Sieves ) Definitions : Important terms include the following :  SI Units—Units belonging to the International System of Units , which is abbreviated SI , as interpreted or modified for use in the United States by the Secretary of Commerce .
 English or I-P Units—Units based upon the yard and the pound , commonly used in the United States , and defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
 Soft Conversion—An I-P measurement that is mathematically converted to its exact SI equivalent .
( Example : Lane Width = 12 feet ( I-P ) = 3.658 m ( SI ) . )
 Hard Conversion—A close approximation of the I-P unit but is rounded logically in the SI system .
( Example : Lane Width = 12 feet ( I-P ) or 3.6 m ( SI ) . )
 SI Base Units—The SI system consists of seven base units of measurement , six of which are used in design and construction .
( The seventh , mole , is the amount of molecular substance and is used in physics . )
Quantity Unit Symbol length mass time electric current temperature luminous intensity meter kilogram second ampere kelvin candela m kg s A K cd  SI Derived Units—Derived units are formed by combining base units , supplementary units , and other derived units according to the algebraic relations linking the corresponding quantities .
The symbols for derived units are obtained by means of the mathematical signs for multiplication , division , and use of exponents .
See the list entitled “ Basic Units of Measure ” for examples of SI derived units .
Appendix A – Metric ( SI ) Information 408/2016 A - 2 Initial Edition Dual Units : Wherever possible , measurements in these Specifications are stated in dual units—SI units followed by I-P units in parentheses .
Dual units may be found in references to SI or dual unit codes and standards ( e.g. , ASTM , AASHTO , etc . ) .
In other situations , where references to other sources are not available , logical “ Conversion Rules ” are applied .
Many SI measurements in these Specifications are soft conversions of the I-P measurements .
Over time , these SI measurements will be changed , through the consensus process , into hard conversions—rationalized , rounded SI dimensions of the I-P measurements .
Certain situations do occur where specifications are stated in SI units only or in I-P units only .
These situations may occur when :  Existing specifications have not been fully converted .
 The specification was developed exclusively using I-P units only or SI units only .
( i.e. , Specified products may be available exclusively in SI sizes or I-P sizes . )
Conversion Rules : The Metric Guide for Federal Construction , published by the National Institute of Building Sciences , provides further direction about developing specifications .
The publication presents “ Conversion Rules ” which aids in developing construction specifications .
The “ Conversion Rules ” include the following :  Use ASTM E 621 , Standard Practice for the Use of Metric ( SI ) Units in Building Design and Construction , as a basic reference .
 Follow the rules for usage , conversion , and rounding in IEEE/ASTM SI 10-1997 , Standard for Use of International System of Units ( SI ) : The Modern Metric System , Annex B , or ANSI/IEEE 268 , American National Standard Metric Practice , Sections 3.5 and 4 .
 Wherever possible , convert measurements to rounded , rationalized , “ hard ” SI numbers .
For instance , if anchor bolts are to be imbedded to a depth of 10 inches , the exact converted length ( i.e. , soft conversion ) of 254 mm might be rounded to either 250 mm ( 9.84 inches ) or 260 mm ( 10.24 inches ) .
The less critical the number , the “ rounder ” it can be , but ensure that allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded .
When in doubt , stick with the exact “ soft ” conversion .
 Round to “ preferred ” SI numbers ( i.e. , hard conversion ) .
While the preferred numbers for the “ 1 foot = 12 inches ” system are , in order of preference , those divisible by 12 , 6 , 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 , preferred SI numbers are , in order of preference , those divisible by 10 , 5 , 2 , and 1 or decimal multiples thereof .
 Use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert I-Ps to SI .
They are readily available and are indispensable to the conversion process .
Simply check with any store or catalogue source that sells calculators or software .
 Be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes ; SI numbers can be significantly larger than I-P numbers ( a cubic meter , for instance , is one billion cubic millimeters ) .

Appendix B – Standard Special Provisions 408/2016 B - 1 Initial Edition APPENDIX B STANDARD SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO PUBLICATION 408 General : This Appendix contains an explanation of the seven Standard Special Provision ( SSP ) Indices ( C , D , G , I , N , P , and S ) relating to Publication 408 .
These indices and the full text of their SSP can be found on the ECMS Website .
SSPs contain instructions , standards , requirements or directions applying to a project , as set forth in the bid proposal , but not contained within Publication 408 .
In many applications they must be further tailored by designers and reviewers for use on specific projects .
Internet Access : Internet access to all SSPs and their contents may be obtained on the ECMS website .
Once at the ECMS homepage select “ Construction Projects ” , then “ Resources ” , then “ Special Provisions ” .
Revisions : Revisions will occur to the indices and their associated contents .
Changes and updates to SSPs may be identified by new versions ( example : A to B ) or by their “ From ” dates .
As SSP entries are revised they will be retained in their original format with an appropriate notation to indicate documents that might have replaced them or their effective “ To ” dates .
Thus entries will not be deleted , only annotated and added .
Therefore , it will always be possible to determine what SSPs were in effect at a certain point in time .
SSP Indices .
Following is an explanation of the seven indices relating to the series of SSPs to Publication 408 , found in ECMS :  C INDEX .
This index addresses Changes to Specifications Related SSPs .
This index includes changes that will be included in the next change to Publication 408 and are included on all projects .
They will exist until the next change to Publication 408 becomes effective and then they will become inactive .
 D INDEX .
This index addresses Design Build Related SSPs .
This index includes SSPs that are specific to Design Build Projects only .
 G INDEX .
This index includes General Provision Related SSPs .
The index associated with this series addresses issues that apply to Publication 408 General Provisions , contract terms and conditions .
General Provision related issues that apply to numbered sections within Publication 408 are found in the S Index .
 I INDEX .
This index includes standard and non-standard Construction Item Related SSPs .
All Non- Standard “ 9000 ” Construction Items and many Standard Master Construction Items can not be included in bid proposals without reference to SSPs found in this index .
 N INDEX .
This index includes Non-pay Item Related SSPs relating to those issues not paid for separately .
 P INDEX .
This index addresses Provisional Specification Related SSPs that are to be used on a case-by- case or trial basis , and require close monitoring when used in conjunction with construction projects .
They may be removed at any time , but they also have the potential for being incorporated into the text of Publication 408 .
An appropriate Strike-Off Letter further addresses each provision within this index .
 S INDEX .
This index includes Section Related SSPs .
This particular index addresses issues and conditions that apply to current Publication 408 numbered sections and also those numbered , but considered “ Seldom Used ( SU ) ” and , therefore , not currently found in the current edition of Publication 408 .

( b ) Good Faith Efforts Requirements .
Good faith efforts are demonstrated by seeking out DB participation in the project given all relevant circumstances .
The following illustrate the types of efforts that may be taken , but they are not deemed to be exclusive or exhaustive .
The Good Faith Review Officer may consider other factors and types of efforts included in a bidder ’ s submission of good faith efforts if deemed relevant .
1 .
Efforts made to solicit through all reasonable and available means ( e.g. , use of the DB Directory , attendance at pre-bid meetings , advertising and/or written notices ) the interest of all certified DBs with the capability to perform subcontracted work .
The bidder should provide written notification , at least 15 calendar days before the bid opening , to allow the DBs to respond to the solicitation .
The bidder must determine with certainty if the DBs are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations .
2 .
Efforts made to select portions of the work to be performed by DBs .
This includes , where appropriate , breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate DB participation .

Demonstrate that the efforts made were those that a bidder seeking to meet the DBE goal established by the Department would make , given all relevant circumstances .
Email the GFE documentation to minorityparticipation @ pa.gov or fax to ( 717 ) 705- 1504 so that it is received by the time specified above for consideration .
All submissions must include , as a part of the GFE documentation , copies of each DBE and non-DBE subcontractor quote when a non-DBE subcontractor was selected over a DBE subcontractor for work on the contract due to the apparent low bidders ’ determination that the DBE ‘ s quote was too high or unreasonable .
Also , indicate on the DBE Minority Participation and Commitment screen that the Good Faith Effort is being submitted for consideration .
Failure to electronically submit the DBE Minority Participation and Commitment Screen including DBE acknowledgement completed in ECMS or email or fax any applicable GFE documentation for consideration within five ( 5 ) calendar days of the bid opening by the 3:00 P.M. deadline will result in the rejection of the bid .
The apparent next lowest bidder will be notified by email to electronically submit evidence of such commitments , by accessing the Department ’ s ECMS website to complete and submit the DBE Minority Participation and Commitment by 3:00 P.M. prevailing local time within five ( 5 ) calendar days after notification .
( c ) Good Faith Effort Requirements .
The demonstration of GFEs is accomplished by seeking out DBE participation in the project given all relevant circumstances .
The following illustrate the types of efforts that may be taken , but they are not deemed to be exclusive or exhaustive ( for more guidance on GFE requirements , refer to 49 CFR Part 26 Appendix C ) .
The Director and/or Committee will consider other factors and types of efforts that may be relevant : • Efforts made to conduct market research to identify small business contractors and suppliers and solicit through all reasonable and available means ( e.g. , use of the DBE Directory , attendance at pre-bid meetings , advertising and/or written notices ) the interest of all certified DBEs who have the capability to perform the work of the contract .
The bidder should provide written notification , at least 15 calendar days before the bid opening , to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation .
The bidder must determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations .
• Efforts made to select portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the DBE goal will be achieved .
This includes , where appropriate , breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation , even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces .
• Efforts made to provide interested DBEs with adequate information about the plans , specifications , and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation .
• Efforts made to negotiate in good faith with interested DBEs .
It is the bidder 's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and suppliers , so as to facilitate DBE participation .
Evidence of such negotiation includes the names , addresses , and telephone numbers of DBEs that were considered ; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and Appendix C – Designated Special Provision 7 ( DSP7 ) 408/2016 C7 – 6 Change No .
3 specifications for the work selected for subcontracting ; and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for DBEs to perform the work .
A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors , including DBE subcontractors , and would take a firm 's price and capabilities as well as contract DBE goals into consideration .
However , the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder 's failure to meet the contract DBE goal , as long as such costs are reasonable .
Also , the ability or desire of a bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own work force does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make a GFE .
Bidders are not , however , required to accept quotes from DBEs if the price difference is too high or unreasonable .
• Bidder ’ s determination of a DBE as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities .
The contractor 's standing within its industry , membership in specific groups , organizations , or associations and political or social affiliations ( for example union vs. non-union employee status ) are not legitimate causes for the rejection or non-solicitation of bids in the contractor 's efforts to meet the contract DBE goal .
Another practice considered an inadequate GFE is the rejection of a DBE because its quotation for the work was not the lowest received .
However , nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the bidder or prime contractor to accept unreasonable quotes in order to satisfy the contract DBE goal .
• Efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining bonding , lines of credit , or insurance .
• Efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining necessary equipment , supplies , materials , or related assistance or services .
• Efforts to effectively use the services of the Department 's DBE Supportive Services Center ; services of the Department ’ s SBE Supportive Services Center ; services of available minority/women community organizations ; minority/women contractors ' groups ; local , State , and Federal minority/women business assistance offices ; and other organizations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBEs .

VII .
ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION— To ensure that all obligations awarded to DBEs under this contract are met , the Department will review the Contractor 's DBE involvement efforts during the performance of the project whether or not the DBE is listed on the approved DBE Minority Participation and Commitment .
The review will include a CUF review and analysis .
Sanctions .
Upon completion of the work the Department will review the actual DBE participation and make a determination regarding the Contractor 's compliance with the applicable requirements .
Sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance or unwarranted shortfalls in the approved DBE goal .
VIII .
ACTIONS REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACTOR DURING CONSTRUCTION— ( a ) DBE Participation .
Must continue to make GFEs for the life of the project .
When DBE Minority Participation and Commitment is approved with a DBE participation less than the contract DBE goal , continue GFE toward meeting the contract DBE goal .
Ensure that the Commitment is attained .
Proof of attainment is provided by payments to DBEs and documented in ECMS .
( b ) DBE Subcontractor Approval .
Firms listed on DBE Minority Participation and Commitment are not to commence work until they are approved .
All firms listed on the approved DBE Minority Participation and Commitment , including those business types other than subcontractor ( i.e .
dealers , truckers , service providers ) , must be submitted for subcontractor approval after the contract is executed and approved before DBEs actual performance of work .
The subcontractor request must be equal to or greater than the committed amount .
Submit for subcontractor approval any other DBE whether or not they are listed on the approved DBE Minority Participation and Commitment .
When submitting request for subcontractor approval , attach a copy of the DBE subcontract or agreement or : • A copy of the executed signature page , • A copy of the description of the scope of work , and • A copy of the unit prices as they appear in the DBE 's subcontract or agreement .
( c ) Conditional Approval Resolution .
Continually monitor conditional approval of DBE subcontractors .
Examples of these conditional approvals may include prequalification requirements and distinction between dealer and broker .
( d ) Substitution .
Obtain approval before substituting a DBE or making any change to the DBE participation listed on the approved DBE Minority Participation and Commitment or approved DBE subcontractor .
Immediately request substitution authorization from the District in writing .
The request must include documentation supporting the substitution and written agreement from the DBE to the change .
Include proof that a certified letter giving the DBE five ( 5 ) days to respond with acceptance or to notify the Department of non-acceptance .
Demonstrate that every effort has been made to allow the DBE to perform .
The District will contact the Bureau of Project Delivery , Contract Awards .
Appendix C – Designated Special Provision 7 ( DSP7 ) 408/2016 C7 – 8 Change No .
3 1 .
If the arrangement to be replaced is agreeable between the Contractor and the DBE , document the following procedures : • Make a GFE in accordance with V. ( b ) to subcontract the work with another DBE , or subcontract other work items to DBE firms , to make up the DBE shortfall .
A prime contractor ’ s inability to find a replacement DBE at the contract price is not , in and of itself , adequate to support a finding that GFEs have been made to replace the original DBE .
The fact that the prime contractor has the ability and/or desire to perform the contract work with its own forces does not relieve the prime contractor of the obligation to make GFEs to find a replacement DBE , and it is not a sound basis for rejecting a prospective replacement DBE ’ s reasonable quote .
• When the substitution results in meeting the DBE goal , complete a revised DBE Minority Participation and Commitment with DBE acknowledgement and/or a revised subcontractor approval request within five ( 5 ) days of a revision being opened in ECMS .
If the DBE performed on the project , the Revised DBE Minority Participation and Commitment and/or subcontractor approval request should include the total amount paid to the DBE before the DBE substitution .
• When the substitution does not result in meeting the DBE goal , complete a revised DBE Minority Participation and Commitment with DBE acknowledgement and/or a revised subcontractor approval request within five ( 5 ) days of a revision being opened in ECMS and provide additional GFE documentation , including ( 1 ) a statement of efforts made to negotiate with DBEs for specific work or supplies , including the names , addresses , telephone numbers , and emails of those DBEs that were contacted ; ( 2 ) the time and date each DBE was contacted ; ( 3 ) a description of the information provided to DBEs regarding plans and specifications for portions of the work to be performed or the materials supplied ; and ( 4 ) an explanation of why an agreement between the prime contractor and DBE was not reached .
If the DBE performed on the project , the Revised DBE Minority Participation and Commitment and/or subcontractor approval request should include the total amount paid to the DBE before the DBE substitution .
Good Faith Effort Review .
The Department will review the GFE documentation for substitution .
If , during the review of the Contractor ’ s GFE information , the reviewers have questions , the Contractor may be contacted for clarification .
The GFE steps are as follows : a .
Contract Awards reviews and , if acceptable , approves the GFE and DBE revision or recommends that the IRT made the determination .
b .
The IRT either  Approves recommendation that the GFE was met and the Minority Participations substitution will be approved , or  Disapproves the GFE resulting in a shortfall requiring the contractor to continue GFEs .
c. If forwarded to them , the IRT makes a final determination .
Do not perform any of the DBE work included in the substitution request without prior approval from the Department .
If the projected DBE participation on an approved DBE Minority Participation and Commitment meets or exceeds the DBE goal amount for the contract without replacing the DBE , then no contract shortfall exists .
A Revised DBE Minority Participation and Commitment and/or subcontractor approval request must be submitted to reflect the decreased dollar amount .
2 .
If the arrangement to be replaced is not agreeable between the Contractor and the DBE , the following procedures are required : • Until a determination is made , do not perform the DBE work without prior approval .
Appendix C – Designated Special Provision 7 ( DSP7 ) 408/2016 C7 – 9 Change No .
3 • The IRT will review and make a determination and the District will notify both the Contractor and the DBE .
• The Contractor or the DBE may request a meeting with the Department by contacting the District Office .
( e ) SBE Participation .
SBE Firms are not to commence work until they are approved .
The SBE , including those business types other than subcontractor ( i.e .
supplier , trucking , service provider ) , must be submitted for subcontractor approval after the contract is executed and approved before the SBEs actual performance of work .
( f ) Additional Work .
When additional work is required for any classification of work which is identified on the DBE Minority Participation and Commitment to be performed by the DBE , at least 50 % of this additional work will be performed by the same DBE unless the DBE submits , in writing , that it can not perform the work due to its own limitations .
( g ) Progress Payments .
Make payments in accordance with Section 110.05 .
Enter DBE and SBE progress payments into ECMS monthly .
Bring to the attention of the Department , in writing , any situation in which regularly scheduled progress payments are not made to DBE/SBE subcontractors , suppliers , service provider or consultant .
( h ) Records and Reports .
Keep such project records as are necessary to determine compliance with DBE Requirements .
These records can be used as GFE documentation .
Design these records to indicate : • The number of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged subcontractors , small businesses , regular dealers , manufacturers , consultants , and service providers , and the type of work or services performed on or materials incorporated in this project .
• The progress and efforts made in seeking out DBE and SBE contractor organizations and individual DBEs and SBEs for work on this project .
• Documentation of all correspondence , personal contacts , telephone calls , etc. , to obtain the services of DBEs and SBEs for this project .
Submit reports , as required by the Department .
Certify that the amounts were actually paid to the DBE and SBE for work performed on the project and keep cancelled checks on file in the home office to reflect payment for the specific project and for inspection and audit by the Department .
Enter the payment information in ECMS “ DBE Payments ” within 5 business days after the end of the month and include the following : • The number of contracts awarded to DBEs and SBEs , noting the type of work and amount of each contract executed with each firm and including the execution date of each contract .
• The amount paid to each DBE and SBE during the month and the amount paid to date .
If no payments are made to a DBE/SBE during the month , enter a zero ( $ 0.00 ) payment .
• Paid invoices or a certification attesting to the actual amount paid to each firm , upon completion of the individual DBE 's and SBEs work .
In the event the actual amount paid is less than the award amount , provide a complete explanation of the difference .
Maintain all such records for a period of three ( 3 ) years following acceptance of final payment .
Make these records available for inspection by the Department and FHWA .
If DBE credit is being claimed for material costs included in a DBE subcontract or agreement , submit purchase orders for the material to the Inspector-in-Charge on a monthly basis .

Appendix C – Designated Special Provision 8 ( DSP8 ) 408/2016 C8 - 3 Initial Edition 2 .
EEO Officer : The contractor will designate and make known to the contracting officers an EEO Officer who will have the responsibility for and must be capable of effectively administering and promoting an active EEO program and who must be assigned adequate authority and responsibility to do so .
3 .
Dissemination of Policy : All members of the contractor 's staff who are authorized to hire , supervise , promote , and discharge employees , or who recommend such action , or who are substantially involved in such action , will be made fully cognizant of , and will implement , the contractor 's EEO policy and contractual responsibilities to provide EEO in each grade and classification of employment .
To ensure that the above agreement will be met , the following actions will be taken as a minimum : a .
Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees will be conducted before the start of work and then not less often than once every six months , at which time the contractor 's EEO policy and its implementation will be reviewed and explained .

b .
In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals , the contractor is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system meets the contractor 's compliance with EEO contract provisions .
Where implementation of such an agreement has the effect of discriminating against minorities or women , or obligates the contractor to do the same , such implementation violates Federal nondiscrimination provisions .

d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a reasonable flow of referrals within the time limit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement , the contractor will , through independent recruitment efforts , fill the employment vacancies without regard to race , color , religion , sex , national origin , age or disability ; making full efforts to obtain qualified and/or qualifiable minorities and women .
The failure of a union to provide sufficient referrals ( even though it is obligated to provide exclusive referrals under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement ) does not relieve the contractor from the requirements of this paragraph .
In the event the union referral practice prevents the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to Executive Order 11246 , as amended , and these special provisions , such contractor shall immediately notify the contracting agency .

If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area , it shall apply the goals established for such geographical area where the work is actually performed .
With regard to this second area , the Contractor also is subject to the goals for both its federally involved and non-federally involved construction .
The Contractor 's compliance with the Executive Order and the regulations in 41 CFR Part 60-4 shall be based on its implementation of the Equal Opportunity Clause , specific affirmative action obligations required by the specifications set forth in 41 CFR 60-4.3 ( a ) , and its efforts to meet the goals .
The hours of minority and female employment and training must be substantially uniform throughout the length of the contract , and in each trade , and the Contractor shall make a good faith effort to employ minorities and women evenly on each of its projects .
The transfer of minority or female employees or trainees from contractor to contractor or from project to project for the sole purpose of meeting the Contractor 's goals shall be a violation of the contract , the Executive Order and the regulations in 41 CFR Part 60-4 .
Compliance with the goals will be measured against the total work hours performed .

( c ) If the Contractor is participating ( pursuant to 41 CFR 60-4.5 ) in a Hometown Plan approved by the U.S. DOL in the covered area either individually or through an association , its affirmative action obligations on all work in the Plan area ( including goals and timetables ) shall be according to that Plan for those trades which have unions participating in the Plan .
Contractors must be able to demonstrate their participation in and compliance with the provisions of any such Hometown Plan .
Each contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved Plan is individually required to comply with its obligations under the EEO clause , and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the Plan in each trade in which it has employees .
The overall good faith performance by other contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved Plan does not excuse any covered contractor 's or subcontractor 's failure to take good faith efforts to achieve the Plan goals and timetables .

4 .
Provide immediate written notification to PENNDOT when the union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred to the Contractor a minority person or woman sent by the Contractor , or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor 's efforts to meet its obligations .
5 .
Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area which expressly include minorities and women , including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor 's employment needs , especially those programs funded or approved by the DOL .
The Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under ( g ) 2 above .
6 .
Disseminate the Contractor 's EEO policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and training programs and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its EEO obligations ; by including it in any policy manual and collective bargaining agreement ; by publicizing it in the company newspaper , annual report , etc .

( h ) Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary associations that assist in fulfilling one or more of their affirmative action obligations ( ( g ) 1 through ( g ) 16 ) .
The efforts of a contractor association , joint contractor-union , contractor-community , or other similar group of which the Contractor is a member and participant , may be asserted as fulfilling any one or more of its obligations under ( g ) 1 through ( g ) 16 or these Specifications provided that the Contractor actively participates in the group , makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the Industry , ensures that the concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the Contractor 's minority and female Appendix C – Designated Special Provision 12 ( DSP12 ) 408/2016 C12 - 5 Initial Edition workforce and can provide access to documentation which demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor .
The obligation to comply , however , is the Contractor 's and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor 's noncompliance .
( i ) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established .
The Contractor , however , is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups , both male and female , and all women , both minority and non-minority .
Consequently , the Contractor may be in violation of the Executive Order if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner ( for example , even though the Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally , the Contractor may be in violation of the Executive Order if a specific minority group of women is underutilized ) .
( j ) The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .
( k ) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts pursuant to Executive Order 11246 .
( l ) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these Specifications and of the Equal Opportunity Clause , including suspension , termination , and cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed or ordered pursuant to Executive Order 11246 , as amended , and its implementing regulations , by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs .
Any contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation of these Specifications and Executive Order 11246 , as amended .
( m ) The Contractor , in fulfilling its obligations under these Specifications , shall implement specific affirmative action steps , at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph ( g ) of these Specifications , so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity .
If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of the Executive Order , regulations , or these Specifications , PENNDOT shall proceed according to 41 CFR 60-4.8 .
( n ) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related activity to ensure that the company EEO policy is being carried out to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required by the Government and to keep records .
Records shall at least include for each employee the name , address , telephone numbers , construction trade , union affiliation if any , employee identification number when assigned , social security number , race , sex , status ( e.g. , mechanic , apprentice , trainee , helper , or laborer ) , dates of changes in status , hours worked per week in the indicated trade , rate of pay , and locations at which the work was performed .
Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form ; however , to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement , contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records .
( o ) Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws which establish different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of local or other area resident ( e.g. , those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program ) .

The Index below contains the specifics of all Changes , which includes where revisions have been made and why .
The Change Process : Changes to Pub 408/2016 will be issued biannually .
Numbered Changes will consist of a Transmittal Letter with instructions for posting of revisions , an updated version of this Index , and the “ new pages ” containing the revisions .
All Numbered Changes will also be filed electronically in sequential order on the PENNDOT Website .
Numbered Changes will be incorporated into the Pub 408/2016 and filed under the Change Letters and Indices portion of the Publication .
Hardcopy users must physically post the new pages .
However , this process of posting has been completed prior to release on the Internet .
The Researching of Revisions .
It is critical to many users of Pub 408 to be able to determine the point in time revisions were made and what specifically the changes were .
This is particularly important from a contractual perspective when researching specifications that were applicable to projects previously awarded .
To assist in this process users should refer to the Change Index that follows .
If revisions have been made , users can then refer to the specifics found in the Initial Edition or subsequent Numbered Change .

3 INDEX OF CHANGES TO PUBLICATION 408/2016 General : The Index of Changes has been created to assist Pub 408/2016 users in determining the specifics of semiannual changes that have been made since the release of the Initial Edition .
The Index below contains the specifics of all Changes , which includes where revisions have been made and why .
The Change Process : Changes to Pub 408/2016 will be issued biannually .
Numbered Changes will consist of a Transmittal Letter with instructions for posting of revisions , an updated version of this Index , and the “ new pages ” containing the revisions .
All Numbered Changes will also be filed electronically in sequential order on the PENNDOT Website .
Numbered Changes will be incorporated into the Pub 408/2016 and filed under the Change Letters and Indices portion of the Publication .
Hardcopy users must physically post the new pages .
However , this process of posting has been completed prior to release on the Internet .
The Researching of Revisions .
It is critical to many users of Pub 408 to be able to determine the point in time revisions were made and what specifically the changes were .
This is particularly important from a contractual perspective when researching specifications that were applicable to projects previously awarded .
To assist in this process users should refer to the Change Index that follows .
If revisions have been made , users can then refer to the specifics found in the Initial Edition or subsequent Numbered Change .
