It is the intent of these Specifications that the Contractor be fully and exclusively responsible for producing an acceptable end product .
In producing this end product , the Contractor shall exercise control of the Project .
The Contractor may deviate from any method required by these Specifications if the following conditions are met : • Such deviation will produce an end product substantially similar to the end product that would have resulted from the method required by these Specifications ; and • The Department approves of such deviation .
Oklahoma Department of Transportation ( Department ) personnel , except where specifically provided for in these Specifications , will make inspections for the State to document that the Contractor is producing an acceptable product .
The Department will interpret these Specifications to allow the Contractor to control the Project to the greatest degree possible in producing an end result product that is in all respects acceptable .
These Specifications should not , however , be interpreted in any manner that allows a Contractor to produce an unacceptable product or endanger the traveling public .
An acceptable end product is the essence of the Contract .
The Department will only accept the Work performed by the Contractor if the Work substantially meets the Contract requirements as defined by the Contract documents .
The Department presumes that references in these Specifications to manuals and standardized industrial guides are references to the latest published edition , unless otherwise specified .
The titles or headings of the sections and subsections of these specifications are intended for the convenience of reference and shall not have any bearing on their interpretation .
101.02 ACTIVE VOICE , IMPERATIVE MOOD The Department has rewritten this edition of the Standard Specifications for Highway Construction with an emphasis on the active voice .
In a sentence written in the active voice , someone acts on something .
For example : `` The Resident Engineer will take a sample . ''
A similar sentence in the passive voice— `` A sample will be taken '' —would be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample .
This edition of the Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative mood .
The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are already understood .
In these Standard Specifications , the Department is stating its requirements or directions for the Work to the Contractor ; such statements have the same force as if they contained the word `` shall . ''
In an imperative sentence such as , `` Pour the concrete , '' the Department is indicating that it requires the Contractor to 101.02 GENERAL INFORMATION , DEFINITIONS AND TERMS 4 101.02 GENERAL INFORMATION , DEFINITIONS AND TERMS pour the concrete .
Before an award of a contract , imperative statements are directed to the bidder ( s ) .
After a contract has been awarded , imperatives are directed to the Contractor .
The Department will identify parties other than the bidder or Contractor to whom it gives a responsibility in these Standard Specifications .
In phrasings where the responsible party has already been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so , the Department may use the passive voice .
101.03 ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS Where the following abbreviations and acronyms are used in these Specifications , Contracts , Bid Forms , or on Plans , they indicate the following expressions : Table 101:1 Abbreviations and Acronyms Short Form Long Form AAA American Arbitration Association AAN American Association of Nurserymen AAR Association of American Railroads AASHTO American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ACI American Concrete Institute AGC Associated General Contractors of America AIA American Institute of Architects AISC American Institute of Steel Construction AISI American Iron & Steel Institute ANSI American National Standards Institute ARA American Railway Association AREA American Railroad Engineering Association ARTBA American Road and Transportation Builders Association ASA American Standards Association ASCE American Society of Civil Engineers ASLA American Society of Landscape Architects ASTM American Society of Testing and Materials ATSSA American Traffic Safety Services Association AWPA American Wood Preservers Association AWWA American Water Works Association AWS American Welding Society CFR Code of Federal Regulations EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency FAA Federal Aviation Administration FAST Guide Field Acceptance Sampling & Testing Guide FHWA Federal Highway Administration FSS Federal Specifications and Standards ( General Services Administration ) IES Illuminating Engineering Society of North America IMSA International Municipal Signal Association ITE Institute of Traffic Engineers MUTCD Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways NCHRP National Cooperative Highway Research Program NEC National Electrical Code NEMA National Electrical Manufacturers Association ODEQ Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ODOT Oklahoma Department of Transportation GENERAL INFORMATION , DEFINITIONS AND TERMS 101.04 5 Table 101:1 Abbreviations and Acronyms Short Form Long Form OPDES Oklahoma Pollution Discharge Elimination System OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration SAE Society of Automotive Engineers UL Underwriter 's Laboratory USACE United States Army Corps of Engineers USFWS United Stated Fish & Wildlife Services 101.04 MEASUREMENT SYMBOLS Where the following measurement symbols are used in these Specifications , Contracts , Bid Forms , or on Plans , they indicate the following expressions : Table 101:2 Dual-Unit Measurement Symbols SI ( metric ) U.S .

The Resident Engineer will provide a monthly statement ( Time and Diary Report ) to the Contractor showing the number of days charged to the Contract for the preceding month and the number of days remaining for completion of the Contract as of the end of the preceding month .
If the Contractor disagrees with the statement , the Contractor shall submit a written protest to the Resident Engineer within 10 calendar days of receiving the statement and shall include reasons why it believes the statement to be incorrect .
If the Contractor fails to submit the protest within 10 calendar days , the Contractor will waive all rights to protest that time charge .
A separate written protest of time charges submitted within the required 10 calendar day period is a requirement that must be satisfied before any corrections will be made to assessed Contract Time charges .
B .
Calendar Day Contract If the Contract Time is on a calendar day basis , it shall consist of the number of calendar days required by the Contract , counting from the effective date of the Notice to Proceed or from the date the Contractor begins work , whichever is earlier , including all Sundays , holidays , and non-work days , except as otherwise required by the Contract .
The Department will exclude time charges for all calendar days elapsing between effective dates of any orders of the Resident Engineer to suspend work and to resume work after suspensions , not the fault of the Contractor .
Upon the Contractor ’ s written request , the Resident Engineer may suspend time charges and work from December 21 to the following February 15 .
If the Contractor elects to work during this winter time suspension , the Resident Engineer will charge for each day the Contractor works .
The Contractor shall continue to maintain the Project work site during this or any other time suspension in accordance with Subsection 105.14 , “ Maintenance During Construction. ” The Resident Engineer may suspend time charges once the project reaches substantial completion , as defined in Subsection 105.17.A , “ Substantial Completion. ” PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 108.07 81 This suspension is contingent upon the Contractor ’ s diligence in completing any remaining work .
The Resident Engineer will grant time extensions or suspensions for a calendar day contract that contains incentive/disincentive provisions for the time period subject to the incentive/disincentive provision in accordance with applicable Contract provisions and Subsection 108.08 , “ Incentive/Disincentive for Early/Late Completion. ” ( 1 ) Extensions for Adverse Weather The Department will consider the occurrence of adverse weather conditions during the Contract Time to be a basis for extending the Contract Time if the time or work is not already suspended for other reasons .
The Resident Engineer will determine extensions of the Contract Time for adverse weather conditions on a daily basis and will only extend the Contract Time if adverse weather prevents the performance of work activities critical to milestone or Contract completion .
The Contractor shall make every reasonable effort to minimize the impact of the adverse weather conditions .
The Department will consider days designated by an appropriate authority as “ ozone alert days ” to be adverse weather days , if that authority requires the Contractor to suspend or delay work activities that are critical to milestone or Contract completion .
The Contractor shall make every reasonable effort to minimize the impact of ozone alert days .
The Resident Engineer may justify and document an extension to the Contract Time due to adverse weather by crediting an adverse weather day on the monthly Time and Diary Report with an explanation for the credit .
The Contractor may file a written protest of the time charges indicated on the monthly report in accordance with Subsection 108.07.A , “ Administration and Extension of Contract Time , General. ” If the Resident Engineer did not justify and document the extension to the Contract Time on the Time and Diary Report , the Resident Engineer will justify and document the extension with a Change Order .
( 2 ) Extension for Non-weather Related Delays Beyond the Contractor ’ s Control The Department may consider the occurrence of delays to the Contractor ’ s operations that are beyond the Contractor ’ s control to be a basis for extending the Contract Time , if the time or work is not already suspended for other reasons .
The Contractor shall provide written notice to the Resident Engineer within 7 calendar days of the start of any delay the Contractor believes justifies an extension to the Contract Time .
Within 30 calendar days of the end of the delay , the Contractor shall submit a written request to the Resident Engineer for the extension to the Contract Time that includes reasons for the extensions and supporting documentation .
If the Contractor fails to provide the written notice or submit the written request within the time allowed , the Resident Engineer will not consider the request for the delay .
The Contractor may only request extensions to the Contract Time for the delays that meet the following criteria : • Beyond the Contractor ’ s control ; • Not the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors , suppliers , and vendors ; and 108.07 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 82 • Prevent or impede the performance of work activities that are critical to milestone or Contract completion .
The Department will base the number of calendar days in the Contract Time as awarded on the original quantities in accordance with Subsection 102.05 , “ Interpretation of Quantities and Bid Proposal. ” If satisfactory completion of the Contract requires additional quantities work , greater than those stated in the Proposal Forms , the Resident Engineer may increase the Contract Time commensurate with the amount and difficulty of the additional work .
The Contractor may use scheduling methods described in Subsection 108.03 ( a ) , unless scheduling methodology prescribed in Subsection 108.03 ( b ) is required by the Contract .
The Resident Engineer will only consider time extensions for additional work or delays beyond the Contractor ’ s control that adversely impact the Contractor ’ s schedule and sequence of work and extend the Contract completion past the Contract Time .
The Department will not consider the following Contractor arguments as grounds for an extension to the Contract Time : • The Proposal Forms and the Contract did not state a sufficient Contract Time , or • Previously un-protested time charges were incorrect .
Extended Contract Time approved by the Resident Engineer shall be in full force and affect the same as though it were the original Contract Time .
If the Resident Engineer determines that an extension to the Contract Time that is due to non-weather delays is justified , the Resident Engineer will justify and document the extension with a Change Order .
C. Fixed Completion Date Contract If the Contract Time is a Fixed Completion Date , the Contractor shall satisfactorily complete all work under the Contract on or before that date in accordance with Subsection 105.17 , “ Project Completion and Acceptance. ” The Contractor may only request extensions to the Fixed Completion Date for the delays that meet the following criteria : • Beyond the Contractor ’ s control ; • Not the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors , suppliers , and vendors ; and • Prevent or impede the performance of work activities that are critical to milestone or Contract completion .
The Department will not allow extension to the Fixed Completion Date caused by adverse weather , foreseeable causes , or conditions under the control of the Contractor .
Subsection 108.07.B , “ Calendar Day Contract , ” shall not apply to any Contract containing a Fixed Completion Date .
If the Resident Engineer determines that an extension to the Fixed Completion Date is justified , the Resident Engineer will justify and document the extension with a Change Order .
D. Delays to Contract Time All requests for adjustment to Contract Time shall identify delays actually encountered that prevent or impede the performance of work activities that are critical to milestone or Contract completion , in accordance with Subsection 108.07.B ( 2 ) , “ Extension for Non-weather Related Delays Beyond the Contractor ’ s Control , ” or Subsection 108.07.C , “ Fixed Completion Date Contract , ” at a point in time when such PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 108.07 83 work was scheduled to be in progress .
The Contractor may only use a progress schedule submitted to the Department in accordance with Subsection 108.03.A , “ Activities Schedule Chart and Written Narrative , ” or Subsection 108.03.B , “ Critical Path Method ( CPM ) Schedule , ” before the start of the delayed work to support the Contractor ’ s request for an extension to the Contract Time or delay damages .
( 1 ) Excusable ( Noncompensable Delay ) The Department will consider delays caused by the following for extensions to the Contract Time : • Acts of God , • Acts of the public enemy , • Fires , • Floods , • Epidemics , • Quarantine restrictions , • Strikes , • Freight embargoes , • Documented national or regional material shortages which are industry wide , • State or national emergency declarations , • Unusually severe weather , and • Delays not caused by the Contractor ’ s fault or negligence .
Delays necessitated by compliance with certain federally mandated programs that occur after the Contract is let may provide a basis for an excusable delay .
The Department will not allow additional compensation to the Contractor for such delays .
( 2 ) Compensable Delay The Resident Engineer will consider additional compensation for Department caused delays that prevent the start of work on successive activities and will adversely impact Contract completion .
Float time in the scheduling of successive work elements is a shared commodity and the Department will not pay the Contractor for the use of float time .
The Department will pay additional compensation by Change Order in accordance with Subsection 109.10 , “ Compensation for Project Delays. ” ( 3 ) Notification of Delay Within 7 calendar days of the occurrence of a delay , the Contractor shall provide written notification to the Resident Engineer of such a delay , and indicate that a request for delay consideration will be filed with the Department .
( 4 ) Procedures Following Notification of Delay After notifying the Resident Engineer of the request for delay consideration , the Contractor shall keep daily records of all costs for non-salaried labor , material , and equipment for all operations affected by the delay .
The Contractor shall maintain a daily record of each affected operation , including station locations .
The Resident Engineer will also maintain a daily record of the affected operations .
On the first work day of each week , the Contractor and Resident Engineer will meet and compare their previous week 's 108.07 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 84 108.07 daily records , and the Contractor shall prepare and submit written reports to the Resident Engineer containing the following information : • Number of days behind schedule ; • A summary of all operations that have been delayed , or will be delayed ; • In the case of a compensable delay , the Contractor shall explain how the Department ’ s act or omission delayed each operation , and estimate the amount of time required to complete the project ; and • Contractor may request compensation for extra costs incurred as identified in Subsection 109.04 , “ Differing Site Conditions , Changes , and Extra Work. ” The Contractor shall provide written notice to the Resident Engineer within 30 calendar days of the meeting , and shall include any disagreements between the records .
If the Contractor fails to meet with the Resident Engineer to compare daily records or to report disagreements between the records , the Department will consider the Resident Engineer ’ s records to be accurate .
The Department will not allow requests for delay costs allegedly incurred before the Contractor notified the Resident Engineer .
( 5 ) Procedures Following Completion of Work Alleged to be Delayed The Contractor shall submit to the Resident Engineer a report containing the following information , within 30 calendar days of project completion or completion of phase of work allegedly delayed : • A description of the operations that were delayed and the documentation and explanation of the reason for the delay , including all reports prepared for the Contractor by consultants , if used ; • An as-built chart , or other graphical depiction of how the operations were delayed , and ; • An item by item measurement and explanation of extra costs requested for reimbursement due to the delay .
The Resident Engineer will review the Contractor ’ s report and available inspection diaries , records , and reports .
The Resident Engineer will provide a written decision to the Contractor within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the Contractor ’ s report .
The decision will contain notification of any additional time the Resident Engineer will grant .
In the case of compensable delays , if the Resident Engineer determines that the Department is responsible for delays to the Contractor ’ s operation , the Resident Engineer ’ s written decision will identify the nature and extent of any delay and the compensation which may be due to the Contractor in accordance with Subsection 109.10 , “ Compensation for Project Delays. ” 108.08 INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE FOR EARLY/LATE COMPLETION If it is in the public ’ s interest to complete the project at the earliest possible date , the Contract may include an incentive/disincentive provision detailing applicable dates and work stages covered by the provision .
For each calendar day the project or section of the project is opened to unrestricted continuous traffic before or after the date required by the Contract , the Department will PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 108.09 85 increase or decrease its payment to the Contractor , by the amount established by the Contract .
The Department considers “ unrestricted continuous traffic ” to mean no lane closures will be granted for any of the Contractor ’ s operations necessary to complete the project , and that traffic will follow the final lane configuration as required by the plans for the finished surface for the roadway with lane striping and permanent safety features completed .
The Resident Engineer will determine when the project or section of the project is complete to open the roadway to unrestricted continuous traffic .
Subsection 108.09 , “ Failure to Complete on Time , ” relating to Liquidated Damages will remain in effect and apply to the total Contract Time .
Concurrent Liquidated Damages and disincentive assessments may occur .
The Department will pay the Contractor the amount of incentive , in a progressive estimate , as funds are encumbered for such payment .
Once the Contractor earns an incentive , the Resident Engineer will initiate a Change Order for presentation at the next available Commission meeting to request any additional funds necessary for payment of the incentive .
The Resident Engineer will deduct the amount of disincentive from the next progressive estimate .
Should the amount of disincentive or Liquidated Damages exceed the amount due for work performed in a specific pay period , the Contractor shall reimburse the Department in the amount of the difference within 45 calendar days of notice that payment is due .
Under an incentive/disincentive provision , the Engineer may grant time extensions for the following when such occurrences adversely affect work on the critical path of the CPM schedule : • Significant change that results in quantity overruns in accordance with Subsection 104.04 , “ Significant Changes in the Character of Work ” ; • Significant error in the plans that delays work on the critical path of the project ; • Unknown subsurface utilities ; and • Delays that are demonstrably outside the control of the Contractor caused by governmental agency or railroad company inactivity .
Under an incentive/disincentive provision , the Resident Engineer will not grant time extensions for the following : • Labor disputes or delays in material deliveries , unless it can be shown that such disputes or delays are industry wide ; and • Adverse weather conditions .
108.09 FAILURE TO COMPLETE ON TIME For each calendar day the work remains incomplete after the Contract Time , the Resident Engineer will deduct from the amount due the Contractor in accordance with Table 108:1 , “ Schedule of Liquidated Damages. ” Liquidated Damages are not to be considered as a penalty , but rather a recovery of costs incurred by the Department due to the added cost of engineering , inspection , testing , and other extra expenditures of public funds made necessary by the Contractor ’ s failure to complete the work within the Contract Time .
The Resident Engineer assesses Liquidated Damages as an alternative to 108.09 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 86 108.09 the more difficult and time consuming calculation of determining the actual Department costs .
Table 108:1 Schedule of Liquidated Damages Contract Amount , $ Daily Assessment Rate , $ ≤100,000 300 > 100,000 – 1,000,000 500 > 1,000,000 – 3,000,000 750 > 3,000,000 – 7,000,000 1,000 > 7,000,000 2,000 The Department does not waive its rights under the Contract by allowing the Contractor or Surety to continue and finish work after the Contract Time has elapsed .
If the Resident Engineer determines the work is substantially complete and is in a condition for safe and convenient use by the traveling public , the Resident Engineer may terminate the assessment of all or any portion of the accrued Liquidated Damages , except for Fixed Completion Date Contracts .
108.10 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT The Engineer may declare the Contract in default and advise the Contractor and the Surety of the actions required for remedy if the Contractor does any of the following : • Fails to start the work by the date required by the Contract ; • Fails to perform the work with sufficient resources including qualified on-site supervision , skilled personnel , and equipment necessary to assure the timely completion of the work ; • Fails to perform the work in accordance with the contract requirements ; • Neglects or refuses to remove and replace rejected materials or unacceptable work ; • Discontinues the prosecution of the work ; • Fails to resume work within a reasonable time after written notice to do so , or • Becomes insolvent , is declared bankrupt , or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency ; • Allows any final judgment to remain unsatisfied for a period of 10 calendar days ; • Makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors ; • Fails to comply with contract requirements regarding minimum wage payments or EEO requirements ; or • Is convicted of any felony involving fraud , moral turpitude , or offenses against the public contracting laws of the United States or any State of the United States .
( For purposes of this subsection the Department will consider entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to be equivalent to a conviction . )
The Engineer will provide written notice to the Contractor and Surety of such delay , neglect , or default .
If the Contractor or Surety does not proceed in accordance with the notice within 10 calendar days of receipt , the Department has full power and authority , without violating the Contract , to take the prosecution of the work from the Contractor .
The Department may appropriate or use materials at the project site and enter into an agreement with another Contractor for the completion of the remaining work .
If the Contractor has obtained materials for use on the project and has not incorporated the materials into the work , the Department may purchase acceptable materials from the Contractor at actual cost .
PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS 108.11 87 The Department will determine the methods used for completion of the Contract .
The Department will deduct the following from monies due the Contractor for completed work : • All costs and charges incurred by the Department as a result of the default , including the cost of completing the work under contract , and • Any applicable Liquidated Damages or disincentives .
If such costs exceed the sum that would have been payable under the Contract , the Contractor and Surety shall be liable and shall pay the Department the balance of such costs .
If the Department determines , after termination of the Contractor ’ s right to proceed , that the Contractor was not in default , the rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Department in accordance with Subsection 108.11 , “ Termination of Contract for Convenience of the Department. ” The damages to which a Contractor may be entitled as a result of the improper default termination will be limited to appropriate amounts for the items listed in Subsection 108.11 , “ Termination of Contract for Convenience of the Department. ” 108.11 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT If the Engineer determines that a termination is in the Department ’ s interest , the Department may terminate the entire Contract or any portion of the Contract .

The Contractor shall have on hand at least ten 50 lb [ 22.7 kg ] weights for testing scales .
The Contractor may use certified commercial scales .
Instead of weighing truck loads of material on single sets of scales measuring the gross load , the Contractor may use a Department-approved automatic batch weight and printer system .
The approved automatic batch weight and printer system shall be electronically controlled and capable of determining the net batch weight of material being delivered to the transporting truck .
A weigh ticket containing all the required identifying information shall accompany each load as evidence of the weight .
The automatic batch weight and printer system is subject to the same calibration , inspection , and certification requirements as for the truck scales .
The Contractor shall ensure material measured by volume in the hauling vehicle are hauled in vehicles approved by the USDOT and the Department , and measured at the point of delivery .
Vehicles used for this purpose may be of any size or type approved by the Resident Engineer , provided that the body is of such shape that the actual volume may be readily and accurately measured .
The Contractor shall load all vehicles to at least the strike-off level or capacity established by the Resident Engineer if materials are delivered to the project .
The Department may require the Contractor to level the material in hauling vehicles , as deemed necessary and approved by the Resident Engineer , to verify the volume of material delivered to the project .
The Resident Engineer will establish the capacity of all vehicles and the Contractor shall ensure that the capacity is plainly marked on each vehicle .
The Department will not allow the capacity or marking to be changed without prior approval by the Resident Engineer .
If requested by the Contractor in writing and approved by the Resident Engineer , material specified to be measured by the cubic yard or ton [ cubic meter or metric ton ] may be converted to the other measurement units , as appropriate .
The Resident Engineer will determine the factors for conversion from weight measurement units to volume measurement units and the Contractor shall agree to the conversion factors before the Resident Engineer uses the method of measurement for the pay quantity .
The Resident Engineer will measure bituminous material by the gallon [ liter ] or ton [ metric ton ] .
The Resident Engineer will measure volume at 60 °F [ 15.6 °C ] or correct to the volume at 60 °F [ 15.6 °C ] using ASTM D 1250 for asphalt and ASTM D 633 for tar .
The Resident Engineer will use net certified scale weights or weights based on certified volumes , in the case of rail shipments , as a basis of measurement , subject to correction when bituminous material has been lost from the car or the distributor , wasted , or otherwise not incorporated in the work .
109.01 MEASUREMENTS AND PAYMENT 92 If the Contract requires liquid asphalt measured by the gallon [ liter ] and the Contractor delivers the liquid asphalt to the project with certified weight bill of lading , the Resident Engineer will convert the weight of the liquid asphalt used in the completed and accepted work to gallons [ liters ] using a conversion factor approved by the Department ’ s Central Laboratory .
The Resident Engineer will measure the volume or weight of the portion of any load delivered to the work and not used in the work in the vicinity of the project , and will make the necessary deduction to determine the actual volume or weight of liquid asphalt used in the work .
Liquid asphalt , when measured by weight and converted to gallons [ liters ] shall be paid by the gallon [ liter ] .
The Contractor shall provide all necessary means and assistance for measuring and calibrating distributors and tanks for determining the quantity of material in the distributors and tanks at any time .
The Resident Engineer may require that the Contractor calibrate distributors before use on the project and at any other time the Resident Engineer deems necessary .

The Contractor shall place the distributor on a level area for these measurements .
The Resident Engineer will measure portland cement by the pound [ kilogram ] or ton [ metric ton ] , as appropriate .
The Department defines “ lump sum ” as a pay unit that reflects complete payment for the work of the relevant pay item as required by the Contract .
If the Contract requires a complete structure or structural unit ( in effect , “ lump sum ” work ) as the pay unit , the Department considers all necessary fittings and accessories to be included in the contract unit price for the relevant pay item .
If the Contract requires standard manufactured items , such as fence , wire , plates , rolled shapes , and pipe conduit , and these items are characterized by standard identifications , such as gauge , unit weight , and section dimensions , the Department will consider these standard identifications to be nominal weights or dimensions .
Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications , the Department will accept manufacturing tolerances established by the relevant industries for the relevant work .
B .
Plan Quantities If the Contract requires payment of a contract pay item or of a portion of a contract pay item on a plan quantity basis , the quantities for payment will be those shown on the plans with deductions from , or additions to , plan quantities resulting from approved modifications to the plan quantities by change order .
If the Contractor and Resident Engineer disagree on the accuracy of the plan quantities , either party may , before any work is started that would affect the measurement , request in writing that the quantities involved be measured .
The request must be accompanied with adequate information , data , and calculations to substantiate the belief that the plan quantity is incorrect .
If the Contractor fails to provide information , data , and calculations sufficient to substantiate its claim of the incorrect plan quantity , the Department will only pay for the quantity required by the Contract and approved modifications to the plan quantities at the contract unit price .
If the Resident Engineer finds the plan quantity to be incorrect , the Department will base MEASUREMENTS AND PAYMENT 109.04 93 acceptance and payment on the actual quantities measured in place , or the corrected plan quantity as documented by change order .
