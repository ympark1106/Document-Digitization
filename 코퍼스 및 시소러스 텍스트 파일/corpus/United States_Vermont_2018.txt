( a ) General .
The Contractor and all Subcontractors shall comply with the provisions and requirements of all Federal and State labor laws and with the wage requirements set forth in detail in the Contract .
In case of conflicts between wage determinations made by the U.S. Department of Labor and the minimum wage established by statute , the larger of the two amounts shall be the minimum wage for that classification .
( 1 ) Fair Labor Standards Act .
The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) of 1938 , as amended , 29 U.S.C .
201. a .
General .
No law requires Federal or State agencies to insert in their Contracts a clause to ensure compliance by the Contractor with the FLSA .
However , the FLSA most likely applies to work under a construction Contract with the Federal Government or that is financed with the aid of the Federal Government .
The FLSA requires payment of a minimum hourly rate as well as overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours in each workweek .
Moreover , the overtime provisions of the FSLA and of the “ Eight-Hour Law ” are not mutually exclusive .
Therefore , a Contractor ’ s employees covered by the FLSA are most likely also covered by the overtime provisions of other , applicable laws .
The FLSA , sometimes known as the “ Wage-and-Hour-Law , ” applies to individual workers who are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce as defined in the FLSA .
Workers on virtually all Agency construction jobs are included under these terms .
If a worker carries materials or moves equipment across state lines , unloads or guards materials or equipment arriving from other states , or performs other functions in commerce in the course of performing work , that worker is covered under the FLSA .
Also , if the job is one to repair , reconstruct , enlarge , or improve an existing instrumentality of commerce such as a highway , bridge , or road , the worker is likewise covered under the FLSA while working on the job , including municipal streets if they are available to and are regularly used by interstate traffic .
New construction is covered by the FLSA when the Project ( s ) is ( are ) part of and directly related to the functioning of an existing instrumentality of commerce .
Coverage is therefore extended to construction workers on highways in the “ Interstate System ” or on other roads built to serve as part of a network carrying interstate traffic .
In this regard , workers engaged in work preparatory to actual construction such as surveying , clearing , or grading are also covered .
b. Minors .
Under the FLSA , the minimum age for general employment in the construction industry is 16 years .
The minimum age is 18 years for employment in occupations declared to be hazardous by the U.S. Secretary of Labor .
Included in 108 1-84 this category are the occupations of motor-vehicle driver and helper .
Children 14 and 15 years old may be employed for a limited number of hours and under certain conditions in office work ; they may not be employed in any manner at covered construction sites .
c. Contacts for More Information .
The above is general information concerning the applicability of the FLSA to the highway construction industry .
More information can be found on the U.S. Department of Labor website or : U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division Manchester District Office 1155 Elm Street , Suite 501 Manchester , NH 03101 Phone : ( 603 ) 666-7716 1-866-4-USWAGE ( 1-866-487-9243 ) ( 2 ) Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act .
a .
General .
The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act ( CWHSSA ) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division ( WHD ) .
The Act applies to Contractors and Subcontractors with Federal service Contracts and Federally funded and assisted construction Contracts over $ 100,000 .
Covered Contracts include those entered into by the United States , any agency or instrumentality of the United States , any territory of the United States , or the District of Columbia .
The CWHSSA also extends to Federally assisted construction Contracts subject to Davis-Bacon and Related Acts wage standards where the Federal government is not a direct party , except those Contracts where the Federal assistance takes the form only of a loan guarantee or insurance .
b .
Basic Provisions and Requirements .
The CWHSSA requires Contractors and Subcontractors with covered Contracts to pay laborers and mechanics employed in the performance of the Contracts one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek .
( 3 ) Davis-Bacon Act .
Where the Contract includes Davis-Bacon wage rate requirements , the following also applies .
a .
General .
The wage rate determination of the U.S. Department of Labor which has been incorporated in the proposal may not contain all job classifications necessary for the work contemplated under the Project .
The Contractor is independently responsible for ascertaining area practice with respect to the necessity , or lack thereof , for the use of any job classifications in the prosecution of the work 108 1-85 contemplated by the Project ; no inference concerning prevailing area practices relative to their use may be drawn from the omission of these job classifications .
Further , the omission of a job classification shall not be construed as establishing governmental liability for increased labor cost .
b .
Missing Job Classification ( s ) /Wage Rate ( s ) .
The Contractor shall submit to the Agency any requests for missing job classifications and proposed wage rates .
c. Vermont Labor Laws .
The Contractor ’ s attention is directed to the provisions and requirements of the Vermont Workers ’ Compensation Act and to Vermont statutes regulating employment of minors .
108.07 LABOR AND RENTAL PREFERENCE .
In accordance with 19 V.S.A § 17 , the Contractor shall give preference to Vermont labor and trucks owned in Vermont .
This requirement shall not apply to any highway Project , or any part thereof , financed with Federal funds .
108.08 MEETING PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS .
Contractors are encouraged to use the services of the local offices of the State Department of Employment and Training to meet their personnel requirements .
Recruitment of workers in all occupations and skills is conducted by the State Employment and Training Services , initially from the immediate labor market areas , and when workers with the required skills are not available locally , through the nationwide workforce clearance system of the U.S. Employment Service .
Available workers may be obtained from the Vermont Department of Employment & Training and from the VTrans Office of Civil Rights and Labor Compliance .
108.09 TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE WORK .
( a ) General .
The work may be suspended by the Engineer , wholly or in part , for such period or periods as necessary on account of : ( 1 ) Unsuitable weather conditions .
( 2 ) Failure on the part of the Contractor to carry out instruction or a Written Order , to perform satisfactory work , or to perform one or more provisions of the Contract .
( 3 ) Any other conditions which , in the judgment of the Engineer , make work impractical , dangerous , harmful to the environment , or in violation of a permit or other authorization for the Project .
( b ) Authority of Agency Safety Officer .

( d ) Seasonal Closure .
From December 2nd to April 14th , inclusive , no construction work of any kind shall be done except by written permission from the Regional Construction Engineer , and only under such conditions as specified therein .
Permission will only be granted for work which will result in a direct benefit to the State or the traveling public .
Items which may be considered as a benefit include but are not limited to shorter Contract Duration , a cost savings , increased safety for the traveling public , and an ability to ensure the quality of work .
The Contractor shall request permission in writing , detailing what Contract Items may be affected , a schedule of work , and the benefits to the State or traveling public .
The Agency reserves the right , at its sole discretion to rescind permission to work during the seasonal closure period .

The excavated rock , ledge , boulders , and stone , except where required in the construction of other items or otherwise directed , shall be used in the construction of embankments to the extent of the Project requirements and , generally , shall be placed to form the base of an embankment .
When shown on the Plans , certain portions of rock excavation may be reserved for special use such as rock fill , for embankment construction at locations below high water , or at locations susceptible to erosion .
Frozen material shall not be used in the construction of embankments .
The embankments or successive layers of the embankments shall not be placed upon frozen material .
Placement of material other than rock shall stop when the sustained ambient air temperature , below 32°F , prohibits attainment of the required compaction .
If the material is otherwise acceptable , it shall be stockpiled and reserved for future use when its condition is acceptable to the Engineer for use in embankments .
( c ) Procedure for Placing and Spreading .
When an embankment is to be constructed across open water or across swampy , wet ground , the first layer of the fill shall be rock or Granular Borrow .
The first layer of the embankment may be constructed in one thickness of rock or Granular Borrow , to the minimum elevation at which equipment may be operated , as directed by the Engineer .
Above this elevation , the embankment shall be constructed as specified below .
Material from excavation on the Project shall be used to the extent available and when not available shall be obtained from sources of Granular Borrow or Rock Borrow when authorized in writing by the Engineer .
When trucks are used to place Earth from excavation or borrow , the material shall be deposited on the layer of embankment being constructed , bladed or dozed into place , and shaped and compacted .
Dumping directly onto previously constructed layers will not be permitted .
Embankments of either earth or rock material shall be placed in horizontal layers of uniform thickness and across the full section width .
When it is impractical to construct a full width layer across an embankment , partial width layers may be authorized , provided the full width procedure is resumed as soon as practical .
203 2-13 Logs , stumps , waste material , and oversized cobblestones or boulders shall not be placed within the structural embankment area .
They may be placed outside the structural embankment area at locations directed by the Engineer or , when authorized , disposed of as surplus material .
Initial layers shall begin at the deepest part of the fill .
Except for the first layer of fill over swampy ground and cleared areas , the loose layer thickness shall be limited to 8 inches .
When conditions necessitate , the Engineer may authorize layers in excess of 8 inches but not more than 24 inches .
The Contractor shall make all necessary excavations up to 24 inches deep so that the Engineer can determine moisture , density , and stability , solely at the Contractor ’ s expense .
Effective spreading equipment shall be used on each layer to obtain uniform thickness .
Cobblestones or boulders having their least dimension greater than the loose layer thickness being placed shall be removed prior to compaction .
Each layer shall be compacted as specified , and , if necessary , stabilized prior to a successive layer being placed .
Each layer shall be kept crowned to shed water .
As the compaction of each layer progresses , continuous leveling and manipulating will be required to ensure uniform density , a uniform and satisfactory moisture content , and acceptable stability .
The last lift constructed each day shall be graded , crowned , and rolled to ensure adequate drainage .
When A4 , A5 , A6 , or A7 cohesive soils , as identified in Table 703.01A , have excess moisture and can not effectively be air dried or dried by manipulation , the Contractor may layer or mix the material with dry A1 , A2 , or A3 granular soils to obtain acceptable compaction and stability .
The Contractor is responsible for making prudent use of available granular excavation from the Project prior to being authorized the use of Granular Borrow .
The combined loose thickness of mixed or layered materials prior to compaction shall not exceed 16 inches .
During the construction of the embankments , if bulging , cracking , or unstable movement occurs , the placing of the fill material shall be stopped , retarded , or corrected to allow the material to stabilize as directed by the Engineer .
Rutting , rolling , shoving , or other displacement in excess of 6 inches under the action of construction equipment may be considered evidence of stability problems .
When soft or wet clay or silt excavation is being used between layers of reasonably clean stable rock fill , the rock embankment layers shall not exceed 24 inches in loose measurement .
The clay or silt layers shall not exceed 8 inches in loose measurement .
If embankments are to be constructed by using rock excavation , all reasonable precaution must be taken to ensure a solid embankment .
The fill shall be made in uniform layers consistent with the size of the rock being used , but not to exceed 24 inches in thickness .
Individual pieces of rock or boulders with their least dimension exceeding the thickness of the layer being placed shall either be reduced to an acceptable size or placed outside the structural embankment area in such a manner that all voids are filled .
203 2-14 Rock shall not be dumped over the end of a fill .
Rock shall be deposited on the fill and distributed by blading or dozing to ensure proper placement in the embankment so that voids , pockets , and bridging are reduced to a minimum .
( d ) Compaction .
Each layer between the design embankment limits shown on the Plans shall be uniformly compacted using compaction equipment to not less than 95 % of the material ’ s maximum dry density as determined by AASHTO T 99 , Method C. Field density determination will be made in accordance with AASHTO T 191 , Sand Cone Method ; AASHTO T 310 , Nuclear Method ; or other approved procedures .
Field moisture determination will be made in accordance with AASHTO T 99 or measured in accordance with AASHTO T 310 , Nuclear Method .
Locations within the embankment limits where waste materials have been placed shall be compacted to the extent that stability is ensured .
All fill material shall be compacted at a moisture content determined by the Engineer to be suitable for obtaining the required density .
The moisture content in each layer under construction shall not exceed 2 % above the optimum moisture content , and it shall be less than that quantity that will cause the embankment to become unstable during compaction .
The Engineer will consider sponginess , shoving , or other displacement under heavy equipment sufficient evidence of a lack of stability under this requirement , and the Contractor shall stop or retard further placement of material in the area affected to allow the material to stabilize .
When the moisture content of the material in the layer under construction is less than the amount necessary to obtain the required compaction by mechanical compaction methods , water shall be added by pressure distributors or other approved equipment .
Water may also be added in excavation or borrow pits .
The water shall be uniformly and thoroughly incorporated into the soil by discing , harrowing , blading , or other approved methods .
This manipulation may be omitted for sand and gravel .
When the moisture content of the material is in excess of 2 % above the optimum moisture content , dry material shall be thoroughly incorporated into the wet material , or the wet material shall be aerated by disking , harrowing , blading , rotary mixing , or other approved method ; or compaction of the layer of wet material shall be deferred until the layer has dried to the required moisture content by evaporation .
The density requirements do not apply to those portions of embankments constructed of material so coarse that it can not be properly tested with a conventional density testing apparatus .
Instead , the material shall be compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer .
In areas inaccessible to power rolling , the embankment material shall be placed in uniform horizontal layers of not more than 6 inches in depth and compacted by means of approved mechanical tampers to the density requirements specified above .
The use of hand tamps will not be permitted .
Additionally , the following requirements apply to airport compaction : 203 2-15 ( 1 ) Under all areas to be paved , the top 9 inches of the embankment shall be compacted to a density of not less than 95 % of maximum density for cohesive soils , and 100 % for noncohesive soils , unless otherwise shown in the Contract Documents .
( 2 ) In areas designed for the use of aircraft , the determination of maximum density and optimum moisture content will be performed per AASHTO T 180 , Method D. ( e ) Test Borings .
Test borings shall be performed at the approximate locations indicated in the Plans and/or as directed by the Engineer .
When used adjacent to culverts , test borings shall extend to a depth equal to the bottom of the culvert using casing advanced drilling methods .
Alternate drilling equipment that provides a suitably clean , open hole may be submitted to the Engineer for approval .
If void ( s ) are encountered , Controlled Density ( Flowable ) Fill shall be placed to completely fill the void ( s ) .
Confirmatory borings shall be performed in these locations as directed by the Engineer .
The roadway surface at boring hole locations shall be backfilled and then patched using bituminous concrete pavement .
203.12 SUBGRADE .
The subgrade shall be constructed to the lines , grades , and cross-sections shown on the Plans .
After all drainage structures have been installed and the subgrade has been shaped correctly , the subgrade shall be brought to a firm , unyielding surface compacted to attain at least 95 % of the maximum dry density .
This density will be determined by AASHTO T 99 , Method C. A power grader or other approved equipment shall be used during the placement and compaction to obtain the specified cross-section .
Areas of soft , yielding , or otherwise unsuitable material that will not compact readily shall be removed , replaced with a suitable material , and properly compacted as directed by the Engineer .
All loose rock or boulders encountered at subgrade in the Earth excavation shall be removed or broken off to a depth not less than 12 inches below the subgrade .
In excavation areas , the ground shall not be excavated or disturbed below the subgrade except as shown in the Contract Documents or as directed by the Engineer .

For those Contracts having 2,000 tons or fewer of any individual mix type/design of bituminous concrete mixture , control of those mixtures will be analyzed using the following parameters : ( 1 ) If an analyzed sample is outside of the testing tolerances and/or other design criteria , immediate adjustments shall be made by the Contractor .
After the adjustment , the resulting mix will be sampled and tested for compliance with these Specifications .
A second consecutive failing test sample will be cause for the facility to immediately cease production .
In this event , additional adjustments shall be made and tested by the Contractor on a trial basis until the deficiency is corrected .
( 2 ) With the permission of the Engineer , the plant may continue production pending results of these tests , but if the Engineer deems that it is in the best interest of the Project , they may at any time order plant production stopped .
( 3 ) It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to conduct whatever process control the Contractor deems necessary .
Acceptance sampling and testing will be conducted by Agency personnel in accordance with the Agency ’ s Quality Assurance Program .
( c ) Quality Assurance ( QA ) Acceptance Testing .
For those Contracts having more than 2,000 tons of any individual mix type/design of bituminous concrete mixture , control of those mixtures will be analyzed by utilizing the procedure below .
For those Contracts having multiple individual Projects not meeting the 2,000-ton threshold , QA testing protocol may be waived by the Engineer .
Bituminous materials designated for acceptance under QA provisions will be randomly sampled and tested in accordance with the recommended acceptance guidelines specified for the applicable Contract item .
Samples may also be taken any time the material appears defective or when the 406 4-17 Engineer determines that a change in the process or product has occurred .
Acceptance tests will govern in all cases for determination of pay factors without regard to quality control tests .
( 1 ) General .
Bituminous concrete mixtures will be sampled once per sublot on a statistically random basis , tested , and evaluated by the Agency for each mix design for the Contract in accordance with the acceptance criteria specified in Table 406.03H .
TABLE 406.03H – ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA Property Point of Sampling Lot Size Sublot Size Test Methods Air voids 1 Truck at plant 3,000 tons 500 tons AASHTO T 269 , AASHTO T 166 , AASHTO T 209 1 For Marshall mixtures , air voids will be determined by the methods defined in Chapter 5 of the Asphalt Institute MS-2 Manual .
( 2 ) Lot Size .
For evaluating acceptance test properties , the representative tonnage of bituminous material within each lot will be 3,000 tons .
The final resultant partial lot will be processed as a full lot if it consists of four or more acceptance samples .
If the final resultant partial lot consists of fewer than four acceptance samples , it will be combined with the previous lot .
( 3 ) Sublot Size .
A sublot will be 500 tons , except for the final sublot of a partial lot , which will consist of the quantity of material required to complete the partial lot .
If fewer than four samples have been obtained at the time a lot is completed , excluding terminated lots as defined in Subsection 406.03C ( h ) ( 1 ) j. , the material in the shortened lot will be included as a part of an adjacent lot and a pay factor computed for the combined lots .
Generally , this involves combining results of the shortened lot with the results of the subsequent lot ’ s test results .
However , if this occurs on the last lot of production , these results will be combined with the most recent lot ’ s results for a revised determination .
The Engineer may reject material which appears to be obviously defective based on visual inspection .
Such rejected material shall not be used in the work .
( d ) Evaluation for Acceptance .
Items specified to be sampled and tested for QA purposes will be evaluated for acceptance in accordance with the guidelines specified for those Contract items .
All acceptance test results for a lot , as defined in the Specification , will be analyzed collectively and statistically by the Quality Level Analysis – “ Percent Within Limits ” Method using the procedures listed below to determine the total estimated percent of the lot that is within Specification limits .
Quality Level Analysis – “ Percent Within Limits ” is a statistical procedure for estimating the percent compliance with a Specification and is affected by shifts in the Arithmetic Mean ( 𝑥̅ ) of the test results and by the Sample Standard Deviation ( s ) .
The steps in the procedure are as follows : 406 4-18 ( 1 ) Compute the Upper Quality Index ( Qu ) using the following formula : 𝑃���𝑢 = 𝑈𝑃���𝐿 − 𝑥̅ s where : Qu = Upper quality index USL = Upper Specification Limit 𝑥̅ = Arithmetic mean of the test results s = Sample standard deviation ( 2 ) Compute the Lower Quality Index ( QL ) using the following formula : 𝑃���𝐿 = 𝑥̅ − 𝐿𝑃���𝐿 s where : Qu = Lower quality index 𝑥̅ = Arithmetic mean of the test results LSL = Lower Specification Limit s = Sample standard deviation ( 3 ) Determine the Percent Within the Upper Specification Limit ( PWLU ) which corresponds to a given Upper Quality Index ( QU ) from references available through the Engineer .
Note : If a USL is not specified , the PWLU will be 100 .
( 4 ) Determine the Percent Within the Lower Specification Limit ( PWLL ) which corresponds to a given Lower Quality Index ( QL ) from references available through the Engineer .
Note : If an LSL is not specified , the PWLL will be 100 .
( 5 ) Determine the Total Percent Within Specification Limits ( PWL ) using the following formula : 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 = 𝑃𝑈���𝐿𝑈 + 𝑃𝑈���𝐿𝐿 − 100 ( 6 ) Compare the Total Percent Within Specification Limits ( PWL ) to the applicable Rejectable Quality Level ( RQL ) .
The RQL is the PWL value below which the material is deemed unacceptable .
406 4-19 ( 7 ) Determine the Pay Factor ( PF ) for the lot from the process or equation applicable to the specific Contract item .
( 8 ) Results from the above calculations shall be reported to the decimal precision and rounded per the following procedures : a .
For decimal precision , report all Standard Deviation calculations to 0.01 , all Pay Factor calculations to 0.1 % , and use the “ Precision as Displayed ” option when working with Excel spreadsheets .
b .
For rounding , the use of AASHTO “ Rounding Rule D ” shall be discontinued .
Instead , when rounding , if the first digit to the right of the number to be rounded is greater than or equal to 5 , then the number shall be rounded away from zero to the next number with larger magnitude .
If the digit to the right of the number to be rounded is less than 5 , then the number shall remain the same .
For example , for rounding to the nearest one decimal ( 1.0 ) : 5.35 rounds to 5.4 -5.35 rounds to -5.4 5.34 rounds to 5.3 -5.34 rounds to -5.3 ( e ) Pay Factor ( PF ) Determination .
Where the air voids PWL value , as defined in Subsection 406.03C ( d ) , equals or exceeds the Rejectable Quality Level ( RQL ) for air voids of 50 % , the PF for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture , based on test results , will be determined using the following equation : 𝑃𝐴���𝐴𝑈��� = ( 0.28 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) + 75 100 − 1.0 where : PFAV = Air voids pay factor PWL = Total Percent Within Specification Limits ( f ) Rejectable Material .
( 1 ) The Contractor may at any time elect to remove any defective material and replace it with new material at no expense to the Agency .
Any such new material will be sampled , tested , and evaluated for acceptance .
( 2 ) For those lots with an air voids PWL less than 50 % and greater than or equal to 25 % , the PF for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture , based on air voids test results , will be determined using the following equation : 𝑃𝐴���𝐴𝑈��� = ( 2.16 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) − 29 100 − 1.0 406 4-20 where : PFAV = Air voids pay factor PWL = Total Percent Within Specification Limits ( 3 ) For those lots with an air voids PWL less than 25 % , the Engineer will require complete removal of the representative lot and replacement with mix meeting Contract requirements at no additional cost to the Agency .
( g ) Boxed Samples .
If Inspectors are not available to perform their daily inspection duties , then box samples will be taken by the Engineer at the Project site to afford verification of mixture properties .
Boxed samples will be processed at the Agency ’ s Materials Section Central Laboratory .

406 4-48 TABLE 406.14B – ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA Property Point of Sampling Lot Size Test Method Density Compacted in-place Daily - 24 hour max .
AASHTO T 166 , Method A and AASHTO T 209 b .
Acceptance Test Properties .
For the purpose of evaluating acceptance test properties , a lot shall consist of the total quantity of bituminous concrete mixture compacted in- place during any one day ’ s production to a maximum of 24 hours .
Sampling shall be performed at the rate of one sample per lane 0.5 mile , with the exception that there shall not be fewer than six samples taken per any one day ’ s production .
The quantity represented by each sample shall constitute a sublot .
If daily field laydown operations are unexpectedly halted by circumstances such as inclement weather or equipment breakdowns , the Engineer reserves the right to combine the truncated day ’ s production with a subsequent day ’ s production to constitute a single lot for density analysis .
c. Density Pay Factor ( PFD ) Determination .
Where the density PWL value , as defined in Subsection 406.03C ( d ) , equals or exceeds the Rejectable Quality Limit ( RQL ) for density of 60 % , the PFD for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture , based on test results , will be determined by using the following applicable equations : 1 .
Superpave Bituminous Concrete Mixtures .
Where 80 ≤ PWL ≤ 100 , 𝑃𝐴���𝐷 = ( 0.10 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) + 92 100 − 1.0 or , where 60 ≤ PWL < 80 , 𝑃𝐴���𝐷 = ( 0.50 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) + 60 100 − 1.0 2 .
Marshall Bituminous Concrete Mixtures .
Where 85 ≤ PWL ≤ 100 , 𝑃𝐴���𝐷 = ( 0.20 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) + 83 100 − 1.0 or , where 60 ≤ PWL < 85 , 𝑃𝐴���𝐷 = ( 0.40 × 𝑃𝑈���𝐿 ) + 66 100 − 1.0 406 4-49 The PFD for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture used for low production activities not associated with any traveled way paving operation will be 0.00 .

The density of all intermediate and surface courses of compacted pavement shall not be less than 92.5 % nor more than 96.5 % of the corresponding maximum specific gravity for each mix type ( each mix design ) placed per lot .
e. Process Control .
It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to conduct all process control .
Acceptance testing will be conducted by Agency personnel using cores provided by the Contractor in accordance with the coring protocol below .
( 3 ) Coring Protocol .
Original core sampling locations will be restricted to travel lanes only and will not include those areas within 6 inches of a longitudinal joint nor within 50 feet of a transverse joint .
That area encompassing a longitudinal tapered joint will not be selected as a sampling location .
Independent shoulder and mat area core sampling locations may be selected by the Engineer to afford verification of Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 4 ) .
Original core sampling locations will be selected by the Engineer or designee in accordance with ASTM D 3665 within 2 Working Days of the bituminous mixture being placed .
The Contractor will be advised in writing of the selected sampling locations .
The Contractor may challenge whether any specific original sample location is representative of any specific lot by notifying the Engineer .
This notification shall be made immediately upon the sublot locations being selected and conveyed to the Contractor , and being prior to extracting the cores , and shall be further documented in any Contractor job records citing just reasoning for recommending a reselection of original sample locations .
Upon receipt by the Engineer of a written challenge from the Contractor , the Engineer will evaluate it within one Working Day and notify the Contractor in writing of either acceptance or rejection of the challenge .
Rejection of a challenge will result in the Engineer using the original core sampling locations for the determination of density data in any compaction pay factor calculations .
Acceptance of a challenge will result in the Engineer selecting alternate core sampling locations for those challenged samples .
406 4-50 Alternate core sampling locations will be selected by the Engineer by generating new random numbers to determine both new longitudinal and transverse coordinates within the sublot in question .
The alternate core sampling locations will not be subject to further challenge and will be used for the determination of density data in any compaction pay factor calculations .
The Contractor will be notified in writing of the final core sampling locations .
Within one Working Day of the final selection of the core sampling locations , the Contractor shall extract cores in the presence of the Engineer or designee and shall deliver the samples to the Engineer , in a suitable container provided by the Contractor , on the same day the samples are taken .
The Engineer will identify and record the core samples .
Any cores not delivered in a suitable container will be rejected and new cores taken at the Contractor 's expense .
The Contractor shall fill the core holes , at their expense , with hot bituminous concrete pavement at a temperature of at least 200°F on the same day that the cores are taken .
Failure to comply with these provisions may result in payment being withheld for the representative lot of bituminous material .
Core samples 6-inches in diameter shall be taken to satisfy the provisions of this Subsection .
Agency personnel will process the core samples within 10 Working Days and will relay the test results to both the Engineer and the Contractor .
Testing will be performed in accordance with AASHTO T 166 , Method A , for bulk specific gravity ( B ) and AASHTO T 209 for maximum specific gravity ( M ) from tests performed at the plant lab for that day .
As necessary , the Contractor shall mark the cores for saw-cutting in the presence of the Engineer or designee for verification of cut locations .
The Degree of Compaction ( DC ) will be determined as follows : 𝐴���𝐴��� = 𝐴��� 𝐿��� × 10 where : DC = Degree of Compaction B = Bulk specific gravity of bituminous sample M = Maximum specific gravity from plant lab tests To satisfy the requirements of Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 4 ) , physical core samples will be retained for a period of 2 Working Days from the time that DC test results are relayed to the Engineer and Contractor .
In addition , any subsequently “ retested ” or “ re-cored ” samples , as defined in Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 4 ) , will be retained to the point of fully satisfying the requirements of Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 4 ) .
406 4-51 ( 4 ) Core Result Verification .
Upon the test results required in Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 3 ) being relayed to both parties ( the Engineer and Contractor ) , any individual core sample result considered to be an outlier as determined in accordance with ASTM E 178 will enter a core result verification process as defined herein .
This process will consider only those core samples processed by the Agency as acceptance tested samples and does not preclude the provisions of Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 5 ) .
The core result verification process consists of four levels as follows : a .
Level 1 .
The Agency will perform a statistical analysis on all lots of core sample compaction values to investigate any presence of statistical outlier ( s ) as determined in accordance with Table 1 of ASTM E 178 at a 5 % significance level .
In cases where a statistical outlier is not detected , all core sample results as reported under Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 3 ) will be used in any compaction pay factor calculations .
When an outlier is determined to exist , the core sample representing that outlying result will be retested to ensure procedural integrity , including support information accuracy , testing methodology , and mathematical accuracy .
The core sample “ retested ” results will replace the original “ outlier ” core sample results for any future calculations within this Level .
Should it be verified at this point that an outlier does in fact exist or the core sample retested results vary from those originally obtained , the options to either party will be either to compute any compaction pay factors using all core sample test results derived through Level 1 or to proceed to Level 2. b .
Level 2 .
Level 1 outlier core sample results will be replaced by “ re-cored ” sample results to be obtained under this Level .
The re-coring location shall be at the same transverse offset as the original location and shall be offset longitudinally forward 18 inches from the original location .
The re-cored sample will be tested as specified in Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 3 ) and may reenter Level 1 analysis of this Subsection up to and including the point of ensuring procedural integrity .
The re-cored sample will not reenter Level 2 analysis .
Upon receiving re-cored sample test results of Level 2 , the options to either party will be either to compute any compaction pay factors using those re-cored sample test results or to state reasons for belief that said re-cored sample test results are in error .
Receipt of reasons shall be cause for this verification process to proceed to Level 3. c. Level 3 .
A final attempt at field resolution of core sample test results will be addressed under this Level by introduction of a third-party testing facility .
Selection of such a facility will be discussed and mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to beginning construction activities and will not be included in Project QC or acceptance testing processes .
Any findings of a third-party facility will become final and will not be subject to further review .
Payment to a third party for services rendered will be borne by the party having provided the Level 2 reasons leading to Level 3 .
406 4-52 The re-cored samples from Level 2 shall be provided to the third-party testing facility .
The facility will process the re-cored samples and provide results to both the Agency and the Contractor .
Upon receipt of the third-party re-cored sample test results , the options to either party will be either to compute any compaction pay factors using these results or to proceed to Level 4. d. Level 4 .
At this level , the Agency and the Contractor will defer to the requirements specified in Subsection 105.02 .
Both parties shall submit to the Chief Engineer a written report describing the disparity , all subsequent actions taken to date , all documentation related to these actions , and a proposed course of action for settlement .
The Chief Engineer will review the submittals and all relevant Project records and act in accordance with Subsection 105.02 .
If the Contractor does not concur with any final decision by the Chief Engineer , the Contractor may seek other remedies as specified under Subsection 105.02 and the Contract .
( 5 ) Rejected Material .
When the density PWL is less than the Rejectable Quality Limit ( RQL ) for density of 60 % , and the lot has satisfied the requirements of Subsection 406.14 ( b ) ( 4 ) , the lot shall be termed “ rejected material. ” For any lot of rejected material , the Engineer will require complete removal of the representative lot and replacement with mix meeting Contract requirements at no additional cost to the Agency , provided that any one of the following conditions is also met : a .
Lot Standard Deviation ( s ) is greater than 2.0 , or b .
Lot Average Density ( 𝑥̅ ) is greater than 98.0 % , or c. Lot Average Density ( 𝑥̅ ) is less than 90.0 % .
In addition , and at the discretion of the Contractor , any lot of rejected material that does not meet any of the above criteria may be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Agency .
If none of the aforementioned criteria are met and removal and replacement is not implemented by the Contractor , any lot of rejected material will have any Density Pay Factors ( PFD ) calculated as follows : 𝑃𝐴���𝐷 = ( −0.05625 𝑥 2 + 10.575 𝑥 − 496.125 ) − 1.0 where 𝑥 is the lot average density .
In such cases that this Subsection applies , any PFD as computed above will be the solitary pay factor to the representative lot as per the provisions of Subsection 406.19 and Subsection 406.20 .
All other applicable pay factors of the representative lot will be set equal to 0.00 .
406 4-53 406.15 JOINTS .
Joints between old and new pavements , or between each successive day ’ s work , shall have a thorough and continuous bond between the old and new mixtures .
Whenever the spreading process is interrupted long enough for the mixture to attain its initial stability , the paver shall be removed from the mat and a transverse butt joint constructed .
Transverse butt joints shall be formed by cutting the pavement in a vertical plane , at a location approved by the Engineer , where the pavement has a true surface as determined using a straightedge at least 16 feet long .
Otherwise , the transverse butt joint may be formed by trimming using mechanical means such that the full design depth of bituminous material is present at the trimmed joint .
The transverse joint shall be thoroughly coated with emulsified asphalt just prior to depositing the new paving mixture .
When constructing transverse tapered joints , care shall be taken in raking out and discarding the coarser aggregate at the low end of the taper , and in rolling the taper .
The taper area shall be thoroughly coated with emulsified asphalt just prior to the resumption of paving operations .

The Engineer will contact the Agency ’ s Pavement Design Unit Project Manager to arrange for surface testing .
The surface will be tested by Agency personnel by traveling at highway speeds once in each direction on two- lane/two-way non-limited access State highways and other Routes as applicable .
For those two-way limited or non-limited access highways containing truck or passing lanes , only the rightmost lane will be tested in any given direction .
The reported International Roughness Index ( IRI ) value will be the average as calculated based upon travel in both directions .
Two-lane divided Interstate highways and other applicable limited access highways will have both passing and travel lanes tested at highway speeds , with the reported IRI value being the average as calculated based upon travel in both lanes .
For those Interstate or other applicable limited access highways having both barrels of the highway constituting the Project , the reported IRI value will be that average value as calculated based on travel in both lanes of both barrels .
Prior to the highway being surface tested , all Contract items shall be complete such that the Project could be deemed substantially complete , unless otherwise directed by the Engineer , including but not limited to all guardrail , bridge joints , and permanent pavement markings installed , including all side road markings .
There shall not be lane closures or equipment present that would impede highway travel .

406.18 ASPHALT PRICE ADJUSTMENT .
( a ) General Requirements and Conditions .
The purpose of the Asphalt Price Adjustment ( APA ) clause is to provide either additional compensation to the Contractor or a payment to the Agency , depending upon an increase or decrease in the average price of asphalt cement and emulsified asphalt during the construction of a Project .
No price adjustment will be applied beyond the Contract Completion Date , as adjusted by Change Order , or any applicable interim completion dates .
( b ) Price Adjustment Procedures .
Prior to advertising for bids , an Index Price ( IP ) for asphalt cement will be established by the Agency and will be the base from which the APA is computed .
The Contract Index Price will be as stated elsewhere in the Contract for a ton of asphalt cement .
The monthly Posted Prices ( PP ) will be those prices obtained from the Agency ’ s website for the month that the construction activity was performed .
The APA will be debited or credited for asphalt cement when the Posted Price of asphalt cement increases or decreases over its respective Index Price .
The APA will be based upon the Quantity of Asphalt Cement ( QAC ) and Quantity of Emulsified Asphalt ( QEA ) incorporated in the work , determined as follows : ( 1 ) QAC for Batch Plants .
The QAC is determined using the cumulative virgin binder content for each applicable item as reported on the batch ticket .
( 2 ) QAC for Drum-Mix and Continuous Mix Plants .
The QAC is determined based upon the tons of mix placed , multiplied by the virgin binder content reported on the demand tickets , as verified by Agency personnel .
In the event of multiple binder contents , the accepted quantity of mix at each binder content shall be determined , and the total QAC used shall be calculated accordingly .
The accumulated asphalt cement total on the plant automation may be checked and verified by Agency personnel for each mix .
( 3 ) QEA and ACEA for Emulsified Asphalt .
The QEA is determined per the requirements of Subsection 404.11 .
The amount of Asphalt Price Adjustment will be based upon the actual asphalt content of the emulsified asphalt used , which is calculated by multiplying the QEA used by the asphalt content fraction for that emulsion type .
The Asphalt Content of Emulsified Asphalt ( ACEA ) factor is determined from the type of emulsified asphalt used , as specified in Table 406.18A .
406 4-57 TABLE 406.18A – ASPHALT CONTENT OF EMULSIFIED ASPHALTS Emulsified Asphalt Type 1 ACEA Factor CSS-1h 0.57 MS-1 0.55 RS-1 0.55 RS-1h 0.55 CRS-1h 0.55 CRS-1p 0.63 CSS-1h Fog 0.28 1 If an emulsified asphaltic liquid is used in the Contract work under any Contract item subject to the APA provisions and that liquid is not included in Table 406.18A , the ACEA factor for that liquid will be that as determined by averaging Contractor certified test results for the Project .
( c ) Calculation of APA .
The APA to be paid shall be computed as follows : 𝐴𝑃𝐴 = [ 𝑃���𝐴𝐴��� + ( 𝐴𝐴���𝐴���𝐴 × 0.05 × 𝑃���𝐴���𝐴 ) ] × ( 𝑃𝑃 − 𝐼𝑃 ) where : APA = Asphalt Price Adjustment ( lump units ) QAC = Quantity of Asphalt Cement ( tons ) ACEA = Asphalt Content of Emulsified Asphalt factor ( from Table 406.18A ) QEA = Quantity of Emulsified Asphalt ( hundredweight ) PP = Posted Price of asphalt on the date of work ( dollars/ton ) IP = Index Price of asphalt ( dollars/ton ) 406.19 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT .

( 1 ) General .
The Contractor shall follow the procedures and details for placing the deck in accordance with the pre-placement meeting .
The procedure shall provide for adequate labor , equipment , and material supply to complete placement of concrete on the entire deck , or specified portion thereof .
If , during the placement , unforeseen circumstances delay the progression of the pour to a point where the concrete begins to lose plasticity , the Contractor shall be prepared to place a bulkhead , as directed by the Engineer .
If at any time the screed machine does not advance in a 15-minute period due to delayed concrete delivery , mechanical breakdown or other problem , the Contractor shall immediately cover concrete that is under the screed machine past the leading edge of the concrete with wet burlap .
Just before concrete placement is to begin , the burlap shall be removed , the screed machine will be moved back , fresh concrete will be added to the area that was directly under the screed to the leading edge , and the area will be vibrated again .
The screed machine may then be advanced forward to continue the placement .
Approval of their methods and equipment does not relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for obtaining the required surface finish .
Prior to texturing , the finished concrete surface shall be examined by the Contractor .

One pass of the turf drag over the finished area is desired .
The drag shall leave a seamless strip between passes .
The finish texture resulting from the drag shall stop within 15 inches of the curb face , rail anchor bolts , or edge of deck .
Any buildup of concrete at the beginning or end of the pass shall be hand troweled to provide an even transition .
The drag should produce a transverse , skid-resistant micro-texture acceptable to the Engineer , but should not tear the surface .
If the drag is not producing an acceptable micro-texture , the Contractor shall adjust the means and methods until an acceptable micro-texture is achieved .
The Contractor shall check the drag material before the deck pour and from time-to-time during finishing for tears , worn surface , or hardened concrete .
The Contractor shall clean or replace the drag as often as necessary to maintain a well-defined micro-texture .
The turf drag or other acceptable methods should not be applied when the surface is so wet or plastic that the ridges formed flow back into the valleys when the drag has passed , nor should dragging be delayed until the concrete is so hard that sharp ridges can not be formed by the drag .
Fogging or similar methods shall be deployed to ensure that the surface does not dry prematurely .
If the 10-minute maximum , as specified in Subsection 501.17 ( c ) , for applying the wet cure can not be met , then fogging of the area shall be performed in a manner that keeps the relative humidity above the evaporation rate of the concrete surface , but not so excessive that water begins to collect on the surface prior to texturing or other surface manipulating procedures .

Faying surfaces of bolted connections shall meet the Class B slip coefficient value of not less than 0.50 as specified by AASHTO .
Splices and field connections of main members shall have all holes filled with high-strength bolts or cylindrical drift pins , with bolts snug-tightened before external support systems are removed .
Cylindrical drift pins shall be used in the extreme corners of all main member connections to ensure alignment and shall remain until all bolts in the connection have been fully tightened .
( c ) Installation .
Bolted connections shall be assembled with a hardened washer under the turned element .
Hardened steel washers shall be used under both the head and the nut when bolts are used for the following connections : ( 1 ) Oversized holes ( fabricated as per Contract ) ( 2 ) Replacing existing bolts or rivets ( 3 ) Oversized and irregular hole conditions caused from field drilling or reaming ( 4 ) Connections between new and existing steel members Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 ( V : H ) with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis , a smooth beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack of parallelism .
Bolts installed with the stem oriented vertically shall have the heads up .
Bolts installed with the stem oriented horizontally shall have the head towards the weather unless clearance restrictions dictate otherwise .
Normally the nut will be the turned element ; however , if the position of bolt entering or wrench operation clearances prohibit this procedure the bolt may be the turned element .
Tightening of a bolt group shall progress systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges .
Previously tightened bolts shall be re-tightened until all bolts in the connection are tightened to the minimum required tension .
Recalibration of the tightening wrench may be required any time there appears to be a significant change in the bolt tightening conditions .
All bolts in a connection shall first be brought to a “ snug tight ” condition .
“ Snug tight ” is defined as initial tension sufficient to bring all the plies of the connection into firm contact while the drift pins 506 5-69 remain in the connection .
Snugging shall progress systematically , beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges until the connection is fully compacted .
All high-strength bolts shall be tightened to the specified tension as soon after installation as feasibly possible .
Under no circumstances shall bolts be left untightened for more than five days after installation unless specific requirements to do so are indicated in the Contract or directed by the Engineer .
Bolts left in place beyond five days without specific requirements in the Contract or as directed by the Engineer shall be removed and replaced with new bolts at the Contractor ’ s expense .
Bolts shall be tightened to develop a tension not less than 5 % more than the minimum bolt tension specified in Table 506.19A .
Bolts shall be tensioned by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer using one of the following methods : ( 1 ) Tension Control Assembly Method .
A tension control assembly consists of a tension control bolt with a spline end and a suitable nut and washer .
This method shall be employed when installing button-headed or dome-headed high-strength bolts .
All bolts shall be tightened by the application of torque to the nut and counter-torque to the spline end of the bolt using an approved spline drive installation tool .
A random sample of not less than three tension control assemblies of each diameter , length , grade , and type to be used in the work shall be checked a minimum of once each Working Day in a device capable of indicating bolt tension .
The test shall be performed to verify that the spline twist-off develops a tension at least 5 % greater than the minimum bolt tension specified in Table 506.19A .
Additional verification of the tension control assemblies shall be performed as directed by the Engineer .
Separate checks will be required for each diameter fastener with hardened washers placed under the nut and/or bolt head as they will be used in the structure .
Variations in the number or location of washers will require separate checks .
( 2 ) Direct Tension Indicator Method .
Direct tension indicators ( DTIs ) are compressible washers capable of indicating that a specified minimum bolt tension has been attained .
DTIs installed with high strength bolts to indicate bolt tension shall be subjected to field verification testing prior to installation and the installation requirements specified in this Subsection .
DTIs installed with high-strength bolts to indicate bolt tension shall be placed under the head of the bolt with the protrusions facing the head of the bolt , and the nut shall be turned , with a hardened washer underneath it , to tension the fastener .
If for reasons of wrench operations clearance it is necessary to place the DTI under the turned element , the DTI shall be oriented so that the protrusions face outward from the work , and a hardened washer shall be placed between the DTI and the turned element .
Placement of the DTI under the turned element will only be allowed when approved by the Engineer .
506 5-70 The bolt , DTI , hardened washer , and nut assembly used in the verification testing device and installed in the work shall be such that at least three and preferably not more than five threads are in the grip .
The grip is defined as the distance between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head .
The Contractor shall supply 5-mil tapered feeler gauges , a calibrated bolt tension-measuring device and equipment necessary to perform field verification testing and inspection of tensioned bolts .
The feeler gauges , fasteners , and impact and manual wrenches shall be the same as that to be used in the work .
The Contractor shall obtain the services of a qualified technical advisor employed by the DTI manufacturer to make at least one site visit to assist the Contractor and to assure the proper installation and use of DTIs .
This requirement may be waived by the Engineer if the Contractor can demonstrate to the Agency 's satisfaction successful use of DTIs on previous Projects for the Agency .
Verification testing shall be performed in a calibrated bolt tension measuring device , such as a Skidmore-Welhelm Calibrator , with a special flat insert ( supplied by the Contractor ) replacing the normal bolt head-holding insert .
The special insert allows the DTI to be located on the flat front face of the tension measuring device for ease of observation and improved access for measuring the DTI gap during testing .
The purpose of verification testing is to validate the DTI assembly ’ s ability to indicate installation tension above the minimum .
The verification tension specified in Table 506.19B is 5 % higher than the minimum required installation tension in Table 506.19A .
The increase provides confidence that the installation tension can be achieved for the lot .
Three verification tests are required to be performed on random samples of each combination of fastener rotational-capacity lot , DTI lot and DTI position ( under the nut or bolt head ) used on the Project .
All three tests must pass for the DTI and assembly combination to be approved .
Testing shall be performed at the Project site by the Contractor and witnessed by the Engineer .
When testing for the normal DTI position , the nut shall be turned from the rear of the tension measuring device , with the bolt head against the DTI restrained from turning with another wrench .
When testing with the DTI under the turned element , the turned element shall be placed on the flat front face of the tension measuring device and the unturned element will be in the rear held by another wrench .
a. Verification Test .
The verification test shall be conducted as follows : 1 .
Tension the fastener to the Verification Tension load specified in Table 506.19B for the grade and size of fastener .
If an impact wrench is used , tension to a load two-thirds below the required load and use a manual wrench to attain the required tension .
506 5-71 2 .
Determine and record the number of entries of a 5-mil feeler gauge in the spaces between the protrusions .
When using galvanized or epoxy coated DTIs under the turned element , there shall be at least one entry of the feeler gauge .
3 .
The DTI lot will be rejected if the number of entries is less than the value in column 3 of Table 506.19B .
If coated DTIs are used under the turned element , the DTI lot will be rejected if there are no entries .
If the bolts are too short to be tested in the tension measuring device , the Verification Test for the DTI shall be conducted on a longer bolt .
Three verification tests are required as specified above .
Bolts and DTIs used in verification tests shall be marked and shall not be reused in the work .
b .
Installation .
Installation of fasteners utilizing DTIs shall be conducted in two steps as follows : 1 .
Step 1 .
All of the bolts in a connection shall be installed to a snug-tight condition .
Snugging shall progress systematically beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges until the connection is fully compacted .
At the snug-tight condition all of the DTIs shall be inspected with the feeler gauge to verify that they meet the number listed in Column 3 of Table 506.19B .
If the number of entries is less than the values specified in Table 506.19B , the fastener must be removed and another DTI installed , followed by re-snugging of the fastener .
This is required because a fastener 's tension may have relaxed during the snugging of adjacent fasteners .
A compressed DTI does not rebound if the fastener tension is reduced .
If a DTI which has fewer entries were left in place , it would give a false indication of bolt tension .
2 .
Step 2 .
The bolts in the connection shall then be further tensioned to the point that the number of entries for a 5-mil feeler gauge meets the number listed in Column 5 of Table 506.19B .
Tightening shall progress systematically beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges .
Drift pins shall be removed during this process .
Several cycles may be required .

Bolt tension for fasteners with DTIs shall be verified using 5-mil tapered feeler gauges provided and operated by the Contractor .
All bolts installed using DTIs shall be inspected after snug tightening and again after full tensioning , with 100 % of the bolts inspected visually and 10 % of the bolts in any connection ( but not less than two ) inspected by feeler gauge .
If the installation of inspected bolts is accepted , then the connection shall be accepted as properly tensioned .
If any bolt in a connection does not pass inspection , then all ( 100 % ) of the bolts in that connection shall be inspected with the feeler gauge .
Any bolt which does not pass inspection as described herein shall be further tensioned if required .
Bolts installed using tension control assemblies shall be visually inspected for consistent “ twist-off ” and thread stick-out .
Undamaged fasteners may only be reinstalled with the approval of the Engineer , and with the following exceptions : galvanized bolts , ASTM F 3125/F 3125 M Grade A 490 bolts , tension control assemblies , and direct tension indicators shall not be reused .
An additional required inspection step is to check the bolt thread stick-out on the nut side after installation to the final specified gap to look for inconsistency of pattern .
Any stick-outs greater than the other bolts shall be investigated and discarded ( e.g. , if necking down of the bolt has occurred or the wrong length bolt was used ) .
The end of the properly installed bolt shall be at least flush with the nut or stick out not more than three threads .
The Engineer shall be provided with safe access in accordance with the requirements of Section 105 to conduct all inspection deemed necessary during and after the installation of the bolts .
If the Engineer determines that the access provided is unsafe , work will be ordered to halt until such time the access is made safe .
Any delays incurred by the unsafe access will not be cause for a monetary , material , or delay Claim .
506 5-74 506.21 STRAIGHTENING BENT MATERIAL .
Damaged , bent , or misaligned structural steel may only be straightened or corrected by procedures approved by the Agency .
The method of repair proposed by the Contractor shall be submitted as Construction Drawings for approval in accordance with the requirements of Section 105 .
No corrective work shall be performed without Agency approval .
Heating limitations and procedures shall conform to the requirements of Subsection 506.12 .

In addition , the temperature within the curing enclosure shall be monitored using temperature sensors placed carefully within the curing enclosure in such a way that temperatures being measured accurately represent the curing conditions .
The requirement for temperature monitoring may be waived by the Structural Concrete Engineer if the concrete is not subject to accelerated curing and ambient temperatures are expected to be well above 40°F throughout the duration of production .
( c ) Accelerated Curing .
( 1 ) Accelerated curing procedures may be employed in lieu of the standard 72-hour curing procedure described in Subsection 540.08 ( a ) , accordance with the requirements of PCI MNL 116 , Section 4.19 and the following conditions : a .
The “ initial time of set ” is defined in AASHTO T 197 M/T 197 and ASTM C 403/C 403 M as the time it takes fresh concrete to reach a compressive strength of 500 psi .
Testing to determine the time of set shall be done when the temperature is within ± 5°F of the anticipated concrete placement temperature .
Alternately , time of set testing may be found by taking a minimum of three different concrete temperatures at approximately 10°F apart , entering that data on a graph , and then drawing a best-fit smooth curve line through the three data points .

Cooling at this rate shall continue until the concrete temperature is 40°F or less above the ambient temperature outside the curing enclosure .
( 6 ) Precast concrete that has not attained 80 % of the 28-day design strength shall be additionally wet cured until this strength threshold is met .
If the precast concrete has attained 80 % of the 28-day strength during the accelerated curing cycle , no further curing will be required .
( d ) Conditioning .
Following the completion of the chosen curing method , precast elements that will then be exposed to cold weather conditions as defined in Subsection 540.07 ( i ) must be allowed 24 hours to cool and dry in an environment of at least 40°F prior to exposure to cold weather conditions .
