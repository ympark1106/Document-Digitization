a weed management plan is to set practical objectives for each road identified in the response schedule andor the rft and be based on detailed maps of declared weeds present the scope of their infestations and the likelihood of seeds being spread e.g .
proximity to turn off areas .
for example in a road section with isolated individuals the objective might be that all plants are chemically controlled whereas in a core infestation slashing alone may be adequate to prevent weed spread and satisfy obligations under the weeds management act .
objectives need to be measurable so that effectiveness of control measures and spread prevention can be assessed .
objectives should be discussed with the superintendent in conjunction with denr .
address seasonal restrictions to weed reproductive cycles to prevent weed seeding .
darwin east arnhem and katherine regions time the operations to follow the first storms of the wet season andor before seeds are produced by the target plants .
