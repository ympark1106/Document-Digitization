the flsa requires payment of a minimum hourly rate as well as overtime pay for work in excess of num hours in each workweek .
moreover the overtime provisions of the fsla and of the eighthour law are not mutually exclusive .
therefore a contractors employees covered by the flsa are most likely also covered by the overtime provisions of other applicable laws .
the flsa sometimes known as the wageandhourlaw applies to individual workers who are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce as defined in the flsa .
workers on virtually all agency construction jobs are included under these terms .
if a worker carries materials or moves equipment across state lines unloads or guards materials or equipment arriving from other states or performs other functions in commerce in the course of performing work that worker is covered under the flsa .
also if the job is one to repair reconstruct enlarge or improve an existing instrumentality of commerce such as a highway bridge or road the worker is likewise covered under the flsa while working on the job including municipal streets if they are available to and are regularly used by interstate traffic .
new construction is covered by the flsa when the projects is are part of and directly related to the functioning of an existing instrumentality of commerce .
coverage is therefore extended to construction workers on highways in the interstate system or on other roads built to serve as part of a network carrying interstate traffic .
in this regard workers engaged in work preparatory to actual construction such as surveying clearing or grading are also covered .

such rejected material shall not be used in the work .
d evaluation for acceptance .
items specified to be sampled and tested for qa purposes will be evaluated for acceptance in accordance with the guidelines specified for those contract items .
all acceptance test results for a lot as defined in the specification will be analyzed collectively and statistically by the quality level analysis percent within limits method using the procedures listed below to determine the total estimated percent of the lot that is within specification limits .
quality level analysis percent within limits is a statistical procedure for estimating the percent compliance with a specification and is affected by shifts in the arithmetic mean 𝑥 of the test results and by the sample standard deviation s. the steps in the procedure are as follows num num num compute the upper quality index qu using the following formula 𝑃𝑢 𝑈𝑃𝐿 𝑥 s where qu upper quality index usl upper specification limit 𝑥 arithmetic mean of the test results s sample standard deviation num compute the lower quality index ql using the following formula 𝑃𝐿 𝑥 𝐿𝑃𝐿 s where qu lower quality index 𝑥 arithmetic mean of the test results lsl lower specification limit s sample standard deviation num determine the percent within the upper specification limit pwlu which corresponds to a given upper quality index qu from references available through the engineer .
note if a usl is not specified the pwlu will be num .
num determine the percent within the lower specification limit pwll which corresponds to a given lower quality index ql from references available through the engineer .
note if an lsl is not specified the pwll will be num .
num determine the total percent within specification limits pwl using the following formula 𝑃𝑈𝐿 𝑃𝑈𝐿𝑈 𝑃𝑈𝐿𝐿 num num compare the total percent within specification limits pwl to the applicable rejectable quality level rql .
the rql is the pwl value below which the material is deemed unacceptable .
num num num determine the pay factor pf for the lot from the process or equation applicable to the specific contract item .
num results from the above calculations shall be reported to the decimal precision and rounded per the following procedures a .
for decimal precision report all standard deviation calculations to num all pay factor calculations to num and use the precision as displayed option when working with excel spreadsheets .
b .
for rounding the use of aashto rounding rule d shall be discontinued .
instead when rounding if the first digit to the right of the number to be rounded is greater than or equal to num then the number shall be rounded away from zero to the next number with larger magnitude .
if the digit to the right of the number to be rounded is less than num then the number shall remain the same .
for example for rounding to the nearest one decimal num num rounds to num num rounds to num num rounds to num num rounds to num e pay factor pf determination .
where the air voids pwl value as defined in subsection numcd equals or exceeds the rejectable quality level rql for air voids of num the pf for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture based on test results will be determined using the following equation 𝑃𝐴𝐴𝑈 num 𝑃𝑈𝐿 num num num where pfav air voids pay factor pwl total percent within specification limits f rejectable material .
num the contractor may at any time elect to remove any defective material and replace it with new material at no expense to the agency .
any such new material will be sampled tested and evaluated for acceptance .
num for those lots with an air voids pwl less than num and greater than or equal to num the pf for each lot of bituminous concrete mixture based on air voids test results will be determined using the following equation 𝑃𝐴𝐴𝑈 num 𝑃𝑈𝐿 num num num num num where pfav air voids pay factor pwl total percent within specification limits num for those lots with an air voids pwl less than num the engineer will require complete removal of the representative lot and replacement with mix meeting contract requirements at no additional cost to the agency .

step num .
all of the bolts in a connection shall be installed to a snugtight condition .
snugging shall progress systematically beginning at the most rigid part of the connection and progressing to the free edges until the connection is fully compacted .
at the snugtight condition all of the dtis shall be inspected with the feeler gauge to verify that they meet the number listed in column num of table numb .
if the number of entries is less than the values specified in table numb the fastener must be removed and another dti installed followed by resnugging of the fastener .
this is required because a fasteners tension may have relaxed during the snugging of adjacent fasteners .
a compressed dti does not rebound if the fastener tension is reduced .
if a dti which has fewer entries were left in place it would give a false indication of bolt tension .
num .
step num .
