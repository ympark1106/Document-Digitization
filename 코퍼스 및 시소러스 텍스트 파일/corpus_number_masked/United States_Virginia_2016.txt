the dcrm can request approval by the engineer that num num a contractor be paid for training persons in excess of the trainee contract goal speciﬁed or for trainees enrolled on a contract without a trainee goal .
if approved this payment will be made even though the contractor re ceived additional training program funds from other sources provided such other sources do not speciﬁcally prohibit the contractor from receiving other payments .
the department will pay the contractor stipend num per training hour for training occurring on state or federally funded department projects .
the contractor will be credited for each apprenticetrainee employed on the project and will be reim bursed on the basis of hours worked listed on certiﬁed payrolls and the weekly submittal of trainee form cnum .
this form will serve as a record of trainee hours completed under the contract .
if in the judgment of the contractor engineer and dcrm a trainee becomes proﬁcient enough to qualify as a journeyman before the end of the prescribed training program and the contractor so employs the trainee full credit will be given toward the attainment of the trainee goal however the contractor will be paid only for the actual trainee hours completed .
the department will pay the contractor for only those training hours completed if the trainee does not complete training due to layoff termination or resignation .
no payment will be made to the contractor should the required training not be provided or the trainee is not hired as a journeyman and there is evidence of a lack of good faith on the part of the contractor in complying with the requirements speciﬁed herein .
