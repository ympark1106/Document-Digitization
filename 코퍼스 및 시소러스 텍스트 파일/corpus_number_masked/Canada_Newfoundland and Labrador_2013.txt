it will also provide a means to identify contractors with acceptable performance records and to provide a means to identify and deal with contractors with unsatisfactory or unacceptable performance records .
a record of the performance of contractors will be maintained to identify the following a those contractors who by virtue of satisfactory performance as defined herein will continue to be eligible to submit tenders for work with the department .
b those contractors who by virtue of unacceptable performance as defined herein may be subject to having their bidding privileges suspended by the department for a period of time determined by the department based on a review and an evaluation of their contract work on a particular project .
c those contractors who by virtue of unsatisfactory performance as defined herein who may have their bidding privileges suspended based on an evaluation of their contract work on a particular project and other projects completed for the department .
during the execution of the work of the contract before the issuance of a final completion certificate under the contract and during or related to the execution of warranty work related to gc num of the contract the contractor is to be notified immediately if the work is not proceeding or being completed in a satisfactory manner .
this notification in the case of contract work before the issuance of a final completion certificate would normally be confirmed in job meeting records or correspondence to the contractor .
in the case of warranty related work required under gc num notification would normally be confirmed by correspondence to the contractor .
in this respect the contractor performance evaluation system is not intended to interfere with or substitute for the normal written communication that a resident engineer would initiate when confronted with unsatisfactory performance .
government of newfoundland and labrador department of transportation and works highway design division march num num num performance rating methodology the performance of a contractor on a contract will be conducted by the regional engineer in two parts in accordance with the methodology laid out in the forms attached hereto as form numa being the contractor performance evaluation report part i contract work other than warranty work and as form numb being the contractor performance evaluation report part ii warranty work under the contract .
unacceptable performance as defined herein on a single project may result in the suspension of bidding privileges for a period of time to be determined by the department .
unsatisfactory performance as defined herein on a particular project subject to a review of contractor performance on other projects for the department may result in the suspension of bidding privileges for a period of time to be determined by the department .
the performance rating methodology under each of these two parts of the contractor performance evaluation system is now discussed in turn .
performance rating methodology for contractors work other than warranty work the contractors performance in this category will be evaluated on a points rating system relative to quality of work performed timeliness in completing work and managementadministration of contractswork .
this evaluation will be completed within thirty num days of the earlier of the issuance of a final completion certificate for the project or the abandonment of the work by the contractor or the termination of the work of the contractor under the contract by the department .
a quality of work performed num points the quality of the contractors work in conformance with contract documents and industry standards will form the basis for points awarded in this category .
where the contractors performance is in conformity with the contract documents and industry standards the contractors work will be defined to be acceptable and the contractor will receive a score of fifty num points on from numa .
where the contractors performance is not in conformity with the contract documents and industry standards the contractors work will be defined to be unacceptable and the contractor will receive a score of zero num points on form numa .
b timeliness in completing work num points conformance to the specified schedule in the contract in relation to circumstances within the contractors control will form the basis of points awarded in this category .
time shall be of the essence in all department contracts with contractors .
the normal risks associated with contracting are not to be considered as causes beyond the contractors control .
delays caused by subcontractors are the prime contractors responsibility .
however if the prime contractor has taken all possible action to expedite a subcontractors work the effectiveness of this effort shall be considered by the department when evaluating the contractors performance .
timeliness deals with the contractors performance from the date of award to the date of substantial completion .
the contractors performance on post completion activities other than warranty work under the contract such as clean up and addressing identified deficiencies in the work should be taken into account under the management rating .
where the contractor completes the work on time in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the contractor and accepted by the department pursuant to the contract documents march num num the contractors work will be defined to be on time and the contractor shall receive a score of twenty five num points on form numa .
where the contractor completes the work during the same fiscal year that the work was scheduled to be completed in but not in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the contractor and accepted by the department pursuant to the contract documents the contractors work will be defined to be late and the contractor shall receive a score of fifteen num points on form numa .
where the contractor completes the work during the following or a subsequent fiscal year other than the fiscal year that the work was scheduled to be completed in not in accordance with the schedule for completion of the work as set out in the contract documents or the schedule of completion of the work as revised by the contractor and accepted by the department pursuant to the contract documents the contractors work will be defined to be very late and the contractor shall receive a score of zero num points on form numa .
