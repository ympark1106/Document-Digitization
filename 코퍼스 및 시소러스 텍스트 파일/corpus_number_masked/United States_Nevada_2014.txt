the average of the high and low selling price for each of the following areas will be used utah salt lake city area idaho boise area eastern markets northern markets includes e.wa nevada las vegas area reno area california san francisco area los angeles area bakersfield area .
each of these nine average area prices is then used to calculate the weekly average price the weekly average price is used to calculate the basic materials index .
the adjustment will be made by comparing a basic materials index to a biweekly materials adjustment index .
the method for making this comparison is described in the following paragraphs a a basic materials index will be determined by the department on a weekly basis .
the basic materials index in effect for the week a contract bid opening occurs will be the basic materials index for that contract .
