actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an owners design decisions and methodology .
designer actionconsiderations the designer should specify the following in the contract documents areas identified for clearing close cut clearing grubbing removal of surface boulders and removal of piled boulders and mechanical stump cutting in addition to those areas required by this specification .
num areas identified as being environmentally sensitive .
num areas for clearing and close cut clearing within crown land .
num areas where cut trees are to be stacked .
num the areas where work is to be done in or near waterbodies or waterbody banks .
num review crown land clearing with ministry of natural resources mnr to determine volume of marketable timber available .
num identify holders of sustainable forest licences and their addresses from the mnr and make them available to the contractor .
num method of measurement for clearing close cut clearing and grubbing .
num when surface boulders and piled boulders are to be removed that are outside the general grading limits the removal of surface boulders and removal of piled boulders items should be used .
swamp excavation areas do not require grubbing therefore designers should not include a grubbing quantity in the contract documents for these areas .
the designer should include an additional quantity for individual boulders over num mnum in the rock excavation quantity .
num mechanical stump cutting should be considered to avoid damage to adjacent structures that may result from grubbing .
piled boulders greater than num mnum should be designated for removal and be included for payment in the tender item for removal of piled boulders regardless of where they are located .
the designer should ensure that the general conditions of contract and the num series general specifications are included in the contract documents .

date num opss num appendix numa november num for use while designing municipal contracts note this is a nonmandatory commentary appendix intended to provide information to a designer during the design stage of a contract on the use of the ops specification in a municipal contract .
this appendix does not form part of the standard specification .
actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an owners design decisions and methodology .
designer actionconsiderations other concrete pavement rehabilitation treatments should be considered prior to specifying rubblizing .
for effective rubblizing the concrete slab shall be free of delamination and material deterioration .
this specification is written as a method specification identifying a unique process incorporating a resonant frequency pavement breaker .
gradation control of the final product is based on visual assessment of the rubblized material .
when greater gradation control is required of the final product full depth removal of the concrete pavement and offsite crushing is recommended .
all overlying bituminous material shall be fully removed prior to rubblizing .
payment for removal of bituminous material shall be under separate items .
the designer should ensure that areas previously repaired with full depth asphalt are removed to ensure uniform performance of the rubblized material .
proper subgrade support for the rubblizing operation shall be assessed during precontract engineering .
granular a material for backfill purposes may be substituted with an alternate crushed granular material .
when paving directly on the rubblized surface a hot mix asphalt levelling course is recommended .
if an alternate material is required this must be indicated in the contract documents .
the designer should identify the thickness of the concrete slab to be rubblized and identify the type of embedded steel in the concrete slab .
pavement drainage systems including ditch subdrains and outlets are to be staged so that they are installed and operational prior to rubblizing operations beginning .
operations should be staged so that the lateral pavement edge support remains in place until the rubblizing operations are completed .
this is to ensure that the maximum impact energy is transferred to the concrete slab .
since only construction traffic is permitted on the rubblized surface traffic staging should be shown in the contract documents .
the designer should ensure that the general conditions of contract and the num series general specifications are included in the contract documents .

the international pipe bursting association ipba normally assigns pipe bursting work to one of three classifications .
these following classifications january num version are intended for use as general guidelines when considering replacement of existing pipe by pipe bursting techniques .
