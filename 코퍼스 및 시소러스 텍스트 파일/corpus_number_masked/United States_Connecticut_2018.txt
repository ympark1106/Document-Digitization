a contractors ignorance of such requirements shall not in any internal department proceeding or in any claims or other legal proceeding constitute justification for the contractors failure to consider such requirements in formulating a bid proposal or for the contractors failure to ensure that such legal requirements are met with regard to any department project in which that contractor participates .
the contractor agrees that if it should be awarded the contract for any project supported at least in part by federal funding the contractor will not knowingly enter into any lower tier transaction on that project with a person including entities who by virtue of federal law or regulation or by voluntary agreement is currently ineligible to participate in such a project unless after disclosure of such ineligibility such participation is authorized by appropriate federal and state authorities .
the department expects the contractor to obey municipal laws and regulations and cooperate with municipal officials .
in some instances however municipal laws or regulations or the orders of municipal officials may conflict with necessary project activities .
in most such cases the municipality does not have the legal power to enforce its laws and regulations upon the state or upon a state project .
this is because the state is protected by its sovereign immunity .
if local police or other authorities should attempt to stop the contractor from carrying out activities that are necessary in order for the contractor to comply with contract requirements the contractor should politely inform the municipal authorities that they probably do not have jurisdiction over the states project and the contractor should immediately inform the engineer of the attempted interference with project activities .
if the municipal authorities continue to insist upon preventing the contractor from carrying out project activities the contractor should not num num defy the authorities but to the extent possible should await directions from the engineer .

the critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
such requests will be considered by the engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the project as to materials labor or equipment .
for all project delays or time increases except as provided below additional contract time is the sole remedy that the contractor may have and such periods of additional contract time shall be deemed noncompensable delays .
for delays caused by the state in its contractual capacity the contractor may in addition to a time extension request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay and such periods of extended contract time may be deemed compensable delays .
the period of compensable delay is limited as follows num it may not include time more than num days prior to the engineers receiving written notice from the contractor with adequate substantiation of its intent to claim damages for the delay and num it may not include periods of delay for which the state was responsible but during which the contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the state was not responsible .

therefore for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the contract time has expired the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the contract shall be deducted from any money due to the contractor .
liquidated damages are not a penalty but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .

such causes include but are not limited to natural catastrophes acts of the state in either its sovereign or contractual capacity acts of another contractor in the performance of a contract with the state the presence of utility facilities including railroads fires strikes floods or delays by suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the contractor or such suppliers .
the contractors plea that insufficient contract time was allowed under the contract before commencement of the project is not a valid reason for extending the contract time .
requests for an extension of time with adequate substantiation must be presented within num calendar days from the event that is the basis of the request or from the first effect of such an event on the project .
the contractor will be responsible for providing all the documentation necessary to support the reasonableness of the additional time requested .
this shall include a critical path method schedule analysis and accompanying narrative that includes the specific dates and number of days for which the extension is sought the basis or bases for the extension and the schedule analysis illustrated in a graphic representation of the schedule impacts such as a bar chart or other type of graphic schedule .
the critical path is a sequence of activities in a project wherein none of the activities can be delayed without affecting the final project end date .
such requests will be considered by the engineer and granted to the extent that he deems to be fair and reasonable .
requests will not be considered if based on delays caused solely by conditions existing at the time the bids were received and of which the contractor might reasonably be expected to have had full knowledge at the time or upon delays caused by failure on the part of the contractor to anticipate properly the requirements of the project as to materials labor or equipment .
for all project delays or time increases except as provided below additional contract time is the sole remedy that the contractor may have and such periods of additional contract time shall be deemed noncompensable delays .
for delays caused by the state in its contractual capacity the contractor may in addition to a time extension request additional compensation to reimburse it for damages sustained as a direct result of such delay and such periods of extended contract time may be deemed compensable delays .
the period of a compensable delay is limited as follows num it may not include time more than num days prior to the engineers receiving written notice from the contractor with adequate substantiation of its intent to claim damages for the delay and num it may not include periods of delay for which the state was responsible but during which the contractor experienced concurrent delays for which the state num num rev .

numfacilities construction failure to complete work on time time is an essential element of the contract .
since the prosecution of the project may obstruct traffic interfere with business and otherwise inconvenience the public it is important that the project be pressed vigorously to completion .
the cost to the department of the administration of the contract including engineering inspection and supervision will also be increased as the time for project completion is lengthened .
therefore for each calendar day that any work shall remain uncompleted after the contract time has expired the per diem sum of liquidated damages specified in the contract shall be deducted from any money due to the contractor .
liquidated damages are not a penalty but are a reasonable estimate of the damages caused by such delay .
liquidated damages as specified in the contract shall be assessed against the contractor per calendar day from that day until the date on which the project is substantially completed .
the engineer has the right to deduct the amount of the liquidated damages assessed against the contractor from any estimated payment for work performed under the contract or under any other state contract or from any other sums owed by the state to the contractor or to claim and recover such sums by process of law .
