num contract time to complete work a general the time allowed to complete the work or pay item is stipulated in the solicitation documents and will be known as the contract time .
see num. b kinds of contract time the contract time will be expressed in one or more of the following ways num fixed date calculation the calendar date on which the work or pay item shall be completed or num calendar day calculation the number of calendar days from a specified beginning point in which the work or pay item shall be completed .
c beginning of contract time when the contract time is stated in calendar days counting of contract calendar days will begin with the fifteenth calendar day following the date of the notice to proceed .
d recording contract time all contract time will be recorded and charged to the nearest onehalf day .
on contracts with calendar day counts the engineer will furnish the contractor a weekly statement of contract time charges .
the statement will show the number of calendar days counted for the preceding week and the number of calendar days remaining prior to the established completion date for that pay item .

the statement will show the number of calendar days of liquidated damages that have been assessed if any .
these statements will include any exclusions from or adjustments to contract time .
e exclusions from contract time regardless of the way contract time is expressed in the contract certain calendar days will not be charged against contract time .
these exclusions will be allowed when the contractor is prevented from performing work due to one of the following reasons resulting in delay acts of god or nature court orders enjoining prosecution of the work strikes labor disputes or freight embargoes that despite the contractors reasonable efforts to avoid them cause a shutdown of the entire project or one or more major operations .
strike and labor dispute may include union action against the contractor a subcontractor a materials supplier or the agency or suspension of the work by written order of the engineer for reasons other than the contractors failure or neglect .
f time calculation protest in the event the contractor disputes the accuracy of the statement of contract time charges it shall immediately contact the engineer and attempt to resolve the dispute .
if the dispute can not be resolved informally the contractor shall submit a formal written protest to the engineer within num calendar days of the date the engineer mailed or delivered the statement .
failure to submit a formal written protest within the num calendar day period constitutes the contractors approval of the time charges or adjusted time charges itemized in the statement .

except for nume and num delays failure to include this information will constitute waiver of the contractors right to later make such a request .
num rightofway and access delays rightofway and access delays will be taken into consideration in adjusting contract time and in approving additional compensation if the performance of the work is delayed because of the agencys failure to make available to the contractor necessary rightsofway agencyowned or agencycontrolled materials sources that are offered in the contract for the contractors use or access to or rights of occupancy of buildings and other properties the contractor is required to enter or to disturb according to contract requirements .
if the ending date of an anticipated delay is stated in the special provisions only the delay occurring after that date will be considered for adjusting contract time or providing additional compensation .
num suspension of work a general the engineer has authority to suspend the work or part of the work for any of the following causes failure of the contractor to correct unsafe conditions failure of the contractor to carry out any provision of the contract failure of the contractor to carry out orders issued by the engineer the agency or any regulatory authority existence of conditions unsuitable to proper or safe performance of the work or any reason considered by the agency to be in the public interest .
when work has been suspended for any reason the contractor shall not resume work without the engineers written authorization .
b contractors responsibilities during and after suspension during periods of suspension of the work the contractor shall continue to be responsible for protecting and repairing the work according to num and for ensuring that a single designated representative responsible for the project remains available according to numb .

c compensation and allowances for suspension compensation and allowance of additional contract time due to suspension of any portion of the work will be authorized only for agencyinitiated suspensions for reasons other than the contractors failure or neglect .
see nume num and num .
num adjustment of contract time a general contract time established for the work will be subject to adjustment either by increase or decrease for causes beyond the control of the contractor according to the terms of this subsection .
after adjustment the contract time will become and be designated as the adjusted contract time .
except as provided in num and num an adjustment of contract time shall be the contractors only remedy for any delay arising from causes beyond the control of the contractor .
b contractors request not required the engineer may increase or decrease the contract time or the adjusted contract time if change orders or extra work orders issued actually increase or decrease the amount of time required to perform the work .
the engineer may also increase contract time in the event of rightofway and access delays see num and those delays due to causes beyond the contractors control specified in nume .
the engineer will promptly inform the contractor of adjustments made to contract time according to this subsection and will include the reasons for adjustment .
if the agency anticipates delay during performance of the contract and specifies its expected duration in the special provisions the engineer will only consider additional delay beyond the stipulated duration in determining whether to adjust contract time .
c contractors request required in the event the contractor believes that additional contract time is due the contractor shall submit to the engineer a timely request for adjustment of contract time .
the engineer will not consider untimely requests .
the agency regards as timely only those requests for adjustment of contract time that accompany a proposed revised project work schedule submitted according to num for comparison with the last revision of the project work schedule or are not otherwise deemed waived and are submitted within num days after the date of second notification if second notification has been issued .
the engineer will not grant an adjustment of contract time for events that occurred prior to the date of the last revision of the project work schedule .
the engineer will not authorize nor the agency pay acceleration costs incurred by the contractor prior to its submittal of a request for adjustment of contract time to which the acceleration costs relate .
the contractors request for adjustment of contract time shall be submitted to the engineer on a form provided by or in a format acceptable to the engineer and shall include a copy of the written notice required under num .
the request shall include without limitation consent of the contractors surety if the request totals more than num calendar days of additional contract time sufficient detail for the engineer to evaluate the asserted justification for the amount of additional contract time requested num num the cause of each delay for which additional contract time is requested together with supporting analysis and data reference to the contract provision allowing contract time adjustment for each cause of delay the actual or expected duration of delay resulting from each cause of delay expressed in calendar days and a schedule analysis based on the current approved project work schedule for each cause of delay indicating which activities are involved and their impact on contract completion .
d basis for adjustment of contract time in the adjustment of contract time the engineer will consider causes that include but are not limited to failure of the agency to submit the contract and bond forms to the contractor for execution within the time stated in num or to submit the notice to proceed within the time stated in num errors changes or omissions in the supplemental drawings quantities or specifications performance of extra work failure of the agency or entities acting for the agency to act promptly in carrying out contract duties and obligations acts or omissions of the agency or entities acting for the agency that result in unreasonable delay referenced in num causes cited in nume and rightofway and access delays referenced in num .
the engineer will not consider requests for adjustment of contract time based on any of the following contentions that insufficient contract time was originally specified in the contract delays that do not affect the specified or adjusted contract time delays that affect the contractors planned early completion but that do not affect the specified or adjusted contract time shortage or inadequacy of materials equipment or labor late delivery of materials and equipment to be incorporated into the work except under those conditions referenced in nume different area of material source in numa substitution of equipment in numc reasonably predictable weather conditions or other matters within the contractors control or contract responsibility .
e consideration and response by agency the engineer will only consider a contractors request for contract time adjustment submitted according to the requirements of numc .
the engineer may elect not to consider claimed delays that do not affect the specified or adjusted contract time required to complete the work .
the engineer may adjust contract time for causes not specifically identified by the contractor in its request .
the engineer will review a properly submitted request for contract time adjustment and within a reasonable time will advise the contractor of the engineers findings .
if the contractor disagrees num num with the engineers findings the contractor may request review according to the procedure specified in num .
num failure to complete on time liquidated damages a time is of the essence time is of the essence in the contractors performance of the contract .
it is essential and in the public interest that the contractor prosecute the work vigorously to contract completion and within contract time or adjusted contract time .
the agency does not waive any rights under the contract by permitting the contractor to continue to perform the contract or any part of it after the contract time or adjusted contract time has expired .
b liquidated damages delays in the contractors performance of the work will cause the agency to sustain damages increase risk to inconvenience and interfere with the traveling public and commerce and increase costs to taxpayers .
because the agency finds it is unduly burdensome and difficult to demonstrate the exact dollar value of such damages the contractor agrees to pay to the agency not as a penalty but as liquidated damages the amounts determined as specified below for each calendar day the work remains incomplete after the expiration of the contract time or adjusted contract time applicable to that work .
the liquidated damages shall constitute payment in full only of damages incurred by the agency due to the contractors failure to complete the work on time .
payment by the contractor of liquidated damages does not release the contractor from its obligation to fully and timely perform the contract according to its terms .
nor does acceptance of liquidated damages by the agency constitute a waiver of the agencys right to collect any additional damages it may sustain by reason of the contractors failure to fully perform the contract according to its terms .
if the contract is terminated according to numa and if the work has not been completed by other means on or before the expiration of contract time or adjusted contract time liquidated damages will be assessed against the contractor for the duration of time reasonably required to complete the work .
num single contract time the liquidated damages per calendar day for failure to complete the work on time as required by numh when a single contract time is listed under numh will be established using the following formula the liquidated damages per calendar day are num percent of c divided by t as defined in this section .
c the contractors bid amount for the contract .
t the total calendar days between the latest completion date or time listed under numh in the solicitation documents and the bid opening that will result in the greatest value for t. calendar day amounts are applicable when the contract time is expressed on the calendar day or fixed date basis .
num multiple contract times the liquidated damages per calendar day for failure to complete the work on time as required by numh when multiple contract times are listed under numh will be established for each individual contract time as follows num num the agencydetermined percentage of the value of all work required to be complete by a given contract time multiplied by the rate determined using the formula specified in numbnum .
when multiple contract times are listed under numh the agencydetermined percentages of the value of work required to be complete by the contract times listed under numh will be listed in the special provisions .
if liquidated damages should become payable concurrently under any combination of liquidated damage rates the rate that will be assessed will be the highest applicable rate .
calendar day amounts are applicable when the contract time is expressed on the calendar day or fixed date basis .
num termination of contract and substituted performance a termination for default termination of the contract for default may result if the contractor fails to comply with the requirements for records violates any material provision of the contract disregards applicable laws and regulations or the engineers instructions refuses or fails to supply enough materials equipment or skilled workers for prosecution of the work in compliance with the contract fails to make prompt payment to subcontractors makes an unauthorized general assignment for the benefit of the contractors creditors has a receiver appointed because of the contractors insolvency is adjudged bankrupt and the court consents to the contract termination or otherwise fails or refuses to faithfully perform the contract according to its terms and conditions .
if the contract is terminated by the agency upon demand the contractor and the contractors surety shall provide the engineer with immediate and peaceful possession of the project site and of all materials and equipment to be incorporated into the work whether located on and off the project site for which the contractor received progress payments under num .
if the contract is terminated for default neither the contractor nor its surety shall be relieved of liability for damages or losses suffered by the agency because of the contractors breach of contract or entitled to receive any further progress payments until the work is completed .
however progress payments for completed work that remain due and owing at the time of contract termination may be made according to the terms of num except that the engineer will be entitled to withhold sufficient funds to cover costs incurred by the agency as a result of the termination .
final payment to the contractor will be made according to the provisions of section num .
if a termination under this provision is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unjustified the termination shall be deemed a termination for public convenience .
b substituted performance according to the agencys procedures and upon the engineers recommendation that sufficient cause exists the agency without prejudice to any of its other num num rights or remedies and after giving the contractor and the contractors surety num calendar days written notice may terminate the contract substitute the contractor with another entity to complete the contract take possession of the project site take possession of materials on the project site take possession of materials not on the project site for which the contractor received progress payments under num take possession of equipment on the project site that is to be incorporated into the work take possession of equipment not on the project site that is to be incorporated into the work and for which the contractor received progress payments under num and finish the work by whatever method the agency deems expedient .
if within the num calendar day notice period provided above the contractor andor its surety corrects the basis for declaration of default to the satisfaction of the engineer or if the contractors surety submits a proposal for correction that is acceptable to the engineer the contract will not be terminated .
c termination for public convenience the engineer may terminate the contract for convenience in whole or in part whenever the engineer determines that termination of the contract is in the best interest of the public .
the engineer will provide the contractor and the contractors surety num calendar days written notice of termination for public convenience .
after such notice the contractor and the contractors surety shall provide the engineer with immediate and peaceful possession of the project site and of materials and equipment to be incorporated into the work whether located on and off the project site for which the contractor received progress payments under num .
