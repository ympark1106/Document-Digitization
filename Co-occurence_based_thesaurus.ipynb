      "\n",
      "Sentence 29: The SI unit of millimeter should be used to convert inches to millimeters . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 30: The SI unit of Mass is the Kilogram Kg which should be used for smaller masses expressed in pounds .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 31: The megagram Mg should be used for larger masses expressed in tons. . All units peculiar to the various cgs systems measurement systems constructed by using the centimeter gram and second as base units are to be avoided . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 32: In commercial and everyday use the term weight nearly always means mass thus when one speaks of a persons weight the quantity referred to is mass .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 33: In Science and Technology the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that if applied to the body would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall g acceleration of gravity .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 34: When the term is used it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use SI Units properly by using Kilograms for Mass or Newtons for Force .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 35: The use of force of gravity mass times acceleration of gravity instead of weight with this meaning is recommended .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 36: Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 37: The term load means either mass or force depending on its use .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 38: A load that produces a vertically downward force because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 39: Any other load is expressed in force units. . A quantity stated as limits such as not more than or maximum must be handled so that the stated limit is not violated . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 40: Conversion of quantities should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between the accuracy of the data and the given number of digits .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 41: In all conversions the number of significant digits retained should be such that accuracy is neither sacrificed nor exaggerated .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 42: For example a length of ft converts exactly to .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 43: m. If however the ft length has been obtained by rounding to the nearest ft the conversion should be given as m. The proper conversion procedure is to multiply a value by a conversion factor that is more accurate than is required the result is then rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits. . For calculation of results avoid rounding of intermediate quantities .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 44: For reporting results the rule for addition and subtraction is that the answer shall contain no significant digits farther to the right than occur in the least precise number .\n",

      "Sentence 45: The rule for multiplication and division is that the product or quotient vii shall contain no more significant digits than are contained in the number with the fewest significant digits used in the multiplication . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 46: When a figure is to be rounded to fewer digits than the total number available the standard up procedures should be used as follows a When the first digit discarded is less than the last digit retained should not be changed .\n",

      "Sentence 11: Standard Specifications M Page Foreword These Standard Specifications for Road Bridge and Municipal Construction have been developed to serve as a baseline for the work delivered to the public by the Washington State Department of Transportation WSDOT .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 12: The Standard Specifications are incorporated into the written agreement Contract between WSDOT as Contracting Agency and the Contractor except where the Contract indicates that a particular specification has been amended or replaced with a special provision to resolve projectspecific issues .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 13: The decision to amend or replace any standard specification with a special provision is made during the design process and is based upon the sound engineering judgment of the project designer .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 14: These Standard Specifications reflect years of refinement through the literally hundreds of projects the Department delivers each year .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 15: In addition the standards are the result of countless hours of development and review by both our internal WSDOT staff as well as our industry partners through the joint WSDOTAssociated General Contractors Standing Committees .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 16: Finally these standards reflect the contracting philosophy and balance of riskallocation that the Department has adopted through the years .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 17: We believe that this balance of risks provides us the lowest final cost solution to our transportation needs .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 18: For example shifting risk to the Contractor can provide more certainty on final cost but may result in higher initial cost .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 19: On the other hand accepting more risk by the owner can result in lower initial costs but less certainty on the final cost .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 20: We at the Department of Transportation believe that we have reached the optimum point of balance for risk and we will continue to consider this balance on all future specification revisions .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 21: The language above indicates that these specifications are to be used only as a guideline during the design process and that is true .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 22: Once they have been incorporated into a Contract however they become the legal and enforceable language of that Contract .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 23: The Standard Specifications the Amendments to the Standards and the Project Special Provisions along with any attachments in the Contract documents define a Contract and are no longer seen as guidelines .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence 24: Rather they are the written agreement subject to revision only through the change order process .\n",
